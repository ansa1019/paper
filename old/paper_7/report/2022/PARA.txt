(a) certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-gaap results. see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" for details of these items and reconciliations of non-gaap results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").
for 2022, revenues increased 5% to $30.15 billion, driven by significant growth in our streaming services, led by paramount+, and higher theatrical revenues, reflecting the success of our 2022 releases, led by top gun: maverick. these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from our linear networks, including the impact from the rotational nature of the rights to air the super bowl, which was broadcast on cbs in 2021 but another network in 2022. the absence of the super bowl negatively impacted the total revenue comparison by 2 percentage points. the revenue comparison also includes a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rate changes.
operating income for 2022 decreased 63% to $2.34 billion. this comparison was impacted by higher charges in 2022 for restructuring and other corporate matters, as well as lower gains on dispositions. adjusted oibda, which excludes these items, decreased 26%, driven by our investment in our streaming services, and revenue declines from our linear networks, including from the comparison to the broadcast of the super bowl in 2021.
for 2022, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount and diluted eps from continuing operations decreased 83% and 85%, respectively, from 2021, primarily as a result of the decline in operating income. adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount and adjusted diluted eps, which exclude the items impacting the comparability of operating income noted above, discrete tax benefits of $80 million in 2022 and $517 million in 2021, and the other items described under reconciliation of non-gaap measures for 2022, decreased 49% and 51%, respectively, primarily reflecting the lower adjusted oibda.

management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
reconciliation of non-gaap measures results for each of the years presented included certain items identified as affecting comparability. adjusted oibda, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount, and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations (together, the "adjusted measures") exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with gaap. we use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. these measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. in addition, we use adjusted oibda to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. we believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.
because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with gaap, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to paramount or diluted eps from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. these measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.
the following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with gaap.

(b) primarily reflects gains on the sales of cbs studio center, 51 west 52nd street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of cbs ("51 west 52nd street"), and a noncore trademark licensing operation.
(c) primarily reflects a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of an investment that was sold during the third quarter of 2021.
(d) reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.
(e) primarily reflects a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our united kingdom ("u.k.") net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment of an increase in the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning april 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits.
(f) the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of reported diluted eps from continuing operations was 655 million and in the calculation of adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations was 646 million. these amounts differ because adjusted diluted eps excludes the effect of the assumed conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock since the impact would have been antidilutive. as a result, in the calculation of adjusted diluted eps, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding does not include the assumed issuance of shares upon conversion of preferred stock, and preferred stock dividends recorded during the year ended december 31, 2021 of $44 million are deducted from net earnings from continuing operations.

affiliate and subscription affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors ("mvpds") and third-party live television streaming services ("virtual mvpds" or "vmvpds") for carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and our owned television stations (retransmission fees), fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the cbs television network ("reverse compensation"), and subscription fees for our streaming services. for 2022, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 11% driven by growth in subscribers for our streaming services of 21.2 million, or 38%, to 77.3 million at december 31, 2022 from 56.1 million at december 31, 2021, led by an increase of 23.1 million for paramount+ to 55.9 million at december 31, 2022. the increase was partially offset by lower affiliate fees for our linear networks.
theatrical theatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. for 2022, theatrical revenues increased $982 million driven by the success of our 2022 releases, led by top gun: maverick, as well as sonic the hedgehog 2, smile and the lost city. we had fewer theatrical releases in 2021, due to the impacts from covid-19 on movie theaters and film production. releases in 2021 included a quiet place part ii and paw patrol: the movie.
licensing and other licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (tvod) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through dvds and blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. licensing and other revenues for 2022 of $6.49 billion remained flat compared with 2021.

for 2022, content costs increased 9% reflecting investment in content for our streaming services and higher costs associated with theatrical releases, partially offset by costs in 2021 from cbs' broadcast of the super bowl.
in january 2023, we announced that we will be fully integrating showtime into paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023. in connection with this plan, we have undertaken a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of showtime and paramount+. at the same time, we are rationalizing and right-sizing our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and closing or globalizing certain of our international channels. we plan to complete this review in the first quarter of 2023 and abandon or remove from our platforms certain content, which will result in charges for the impairment or abandonment of the affected content, which we estimate will be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
distribution and other distribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs for third-party distribution; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the cbs television network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations.
for 2022, distribution and other expenses increased 27% primarily reflecting higher costs associated with theatrical content as well as the growth of our streaming services, including costs for third-party distribution and to support the international expansion of our streaming services.

since the merger, we have implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in our management structure, some of which resulted in changes to our operating segments (see segments). these initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges of $260 million and $65 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for severance associated with the elimination of positions and changes in management. in 2022, the actions giving rise to the restructuring charges are primarily associated with our segment realignment, our plan to integrate showtime into paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, and restructuring of our international operations. in addition, since the merger we have been consolidating our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. in connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $68 million and $35 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
additionally, in 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $257 million, consisting of $211 million associated with litigation described under legal matters-stockholder matters and $46 million recorded following russia's invasion of ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in russia, belarus and ukraine.

also in 2021, we completed the sale of cbs studio center to hackman capital partners, llc and square mile capital management, llc for $1.85 billion. this transaction resulted in a gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.70 billion.
in addition, during 2021 we recognized a net gain of $117 million, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.

net earnings from discontinued operations in november 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, simon & schuster, which was previously reported as the publishing segment, to penguin random house llc ("penguin random house"), a wholly owned subsidiary of bertelsmann se & co. kgaa. as a result, we began presenting simon & schuster as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2020. in november 2021, the u.s. department of justice (the "doj") filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia to block the sale and in october 2022 the court ruled in favor of the doj. in november 2022, we terminated the agreement and in accordance with its terms, subsequently received a $200 million termination fee (see legal matters). simon & schuster remains a noncore asset as it does not fit strategically within our video-based portfolio. we expect to enter into a new agreement to sell simon & schuster in 2023. assuming that we do so, closing would be subject to closing conditions that would include regulatory approval. simon & schuster continues to be presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

advertising for 2021, the 17% increase in advertising revenues was driven by the benefit in 2021 from cbs' broadcasts of super bowl lv and ncaa division i men's basketball championship (the "ncaa tournament") games for which there were no comparable broadcasts on cbs in 2020 and higher advertising for pluto tv and paramount+. we have the rights to broadcast the super bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the ncaa tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the ncaa tournament with turner broadcasting system, inc. ("turner") each year, covid-19 caused the cancellation of the ncaa tournament in 2020. these noncomparable sporting events contributed 8 percentage points of the advertising revenue increase for 2021. the advertising revenue growth also reflected higher pricing and demand compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by covid-19. these increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks and lower political advertising sales, reflecting the benefit to 2020 from the u.s. presidential election.
affiliate and subscription for 2021, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 14% driven by growth in subscribers for our streaming services of 26.2 million to 56.1 million at december 31, 2021 from 29.9 million at december 31, 2020, led by an increase of 21.1 million for paramount+ to 32.8 million at december 31, 2021. the increase also reflects higher affiliate fees for our linear networks, driven by rate increases, the launch of our basic cable networks in june 2020 and april 2021 on two vmvpds, growth in reverse compensation, and higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines.
theatrical for 2021, the 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from 2021 releases including a quiet place part ii and paw patrol: the movie, while 2020 was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to covid-19, following the release of sonic the hedgehog in the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.
licensing and other for 2021, licensing and other revenues increased 5%, reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 because of covid-19, and increased licensing for consumer products. these increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2020 from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to south park.

n/m - not meaningful content costs for 2021, the 23% increase in production expenses was primarily a result of an increased investment in content for our streaming services; the timing of production, as 2020 was impacted by shutdowns as a result of covid-19; higher sports programming costs, principally associated with noncomparable sporting events; and higher costs associated with increased licensing revenues and the mix of titles licensed in each year.
programming charges during 2020, we recorded programming charges of $159 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to covid-19.
distribution and other for 2021, the 5% increase was a result of cost increases associated with the growth of our streaming services.

segments beginning in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer streaming businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. our management structure was reorganized to focus on managing our business as the combination of three parts: a traditional media business, a portfolio of domestic and international streaming services, and a film studio. accordingly, beginning in 2022, and for all periods presented we are reporting results based on the following segments:
tv media-our tv media segment consists of our (1) broadcast operations - the cbs television network, our domestic broadcast television network; cbs stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, network 10, channel 5, telefe, and chilevisión; (2) premium and basic cable networks, including showtime, mtv, comedy central, paramount network, the smithsonian channel, nickelodeon, bet media group, cbs sports network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including cbs studios, paramount television studios and mtv entertainment studios as well as cbs media ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming. tv media also includes a number of digital properties such as cbs news streaming and cbs sports hq.
direct-to-consumer-our direct-to-consumer segment consists of our portfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services, including paramount+, pluto tv, showtime networks' premium subscription streaming service ("showtime ott"), bet+ and noggin.
filmed entertainment-our filmed entertainment segment consists of paramount pictures, paramount players, paramount animation, nickelodeon studio, awesomeness and miramax.
in january 2023, we announced that we will be fully integrating showtime into paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023.
we present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on dispositions, each where applicable ("adjusted oibda"), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with financial accounting standards board guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our board of directors in consultation with corporate executive management. stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated adjusted oibda. see reconciliation of non-gaap measures for a reconciliation of total adjusted oibda to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with gaap.

affiliate and subscription the 3% decrease in affiliate and subscription revenues mainly reflects lower international affiliate revenues, driven by the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements, resulting in a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services; unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes, which negatively impacted the total affiliate and subscription revenue comparison by 1 percentage point; and the absence of revenues in russia after we suspended our operations following russia's invasion of ukraine in the first quarter of 2022. domestic affiliate revenues contributed 1% of the decline, primarily reflecting lower revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, as the impact from lower domestic subscribers was substantially offset by rate increases, growth in reverse compensation, and the launch of our basic cable networks on a vmvpd in april 2021.

revenues for 2022, the 38% increase in revenues was primarily driven by the success of top gun: maverick.
theatrical the $982 million increase in theatrical revenues was driven by the success of our 2022 releases, led by top gun: maverick. we released eight films in 2022, including top gun: maverick, as well as sonic the hedgehog 2, smile, and the lost city, compared with four films in 2021, including a quiet place part ii and paw patrol: the movie. the lower number of theatrical releases in 2021 was due to the impacts from covid-19 on movie theaters and film production.
licensing and other the 1% increase in licensing and other revenues primarily reflects higher licensing of recent theatrical releases in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by the success of top gun: maverick in the digital home entertainment market, partially offset by the licensing of coming 2 america and tom clancy's without remorse in 2021 and lower revenues from the licensing of library titles.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 31%, mainly reflecting higher profits from 2022 releases, partially offset by lower profits from the licensing of library titles.
fluctuations in results for the filmed entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film's theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.

revenues for 2021, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by increased advertising revenues, including from cbs' broadcasts of tentpole sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts on cbs in 2020.
advertising the 12% increase in advertising revenues was driven by cbs' broadcasts in 2021 of sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts on cbs in 2020, including super bowl lv and ncaa tournament games. we have the rights to broadcast the super bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the ncaa tournament on a rotational basis. the super bowl aired on cbs in 2021 but another network in 2020. the national semi-finals and championship games of the ncaa tournament also aired on cbs in 2021, but covid-19 caused the cancellation of the ncaa tournament in 2020, including the games in the preceding rounds of the ncaa tournament that we share with turner each year. the advertising revenue growth also reflected higher pricing and demand compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by covid-19, as well as a higher level of original programming broadcast in 2021. these increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks and lower political advertising sales.
affiliate and subscription the 5% increase in affiliate and subscription revenues was driven by rate increases, the launch of our basic cable networks in june 2020 and april 2021 on two vmvpds, growth in reverse compensation, and higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines.
licensing and other licensing and other revenues increased 5%, driven by the timing of program availabilities, primarily from the impact of production shutdowns in 2020 due to covid-19, as well as higher domestic licensing in the secondary market, reflecting the benefit from several significant licensing arrangements in 2021, including for ncis and bull. the increase was partially offset by the comparison against the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to south park in 2020.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 1% as the higher revenues were substantially offset by higher costs associated with sports broadcasts, more original programming and higher licensing revenues in 2021.

subscription the 80% increase in subscription revenues reflects growth across our subscription streaming services. global streaming subscribers grew 26.2 million, or 88%, compared with december 31, 2020, led by growth from paramount+, reflecting significant growth in u.s. subscribers and the impact from launches in international markets, as well as subscriber growth for showtime ott and bet+.

revenues for 2021, the 9% increase in revenues reflected growth in licensing and theatrical revenues.
theatrical the 34% increase in theatrical revenues was driven by 2021 releases including a quiet place part ii and paw patrol: the movie, while 2020 was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to covid-19, following the release of sonic the hedgehog in the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.
licensing and other the 7% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by the licensing of coming 2 america, tom clancy's without remorse and halloween kills while 2020 included licensing of the first quarter 2020 theatrical release sonic the hedgehog, but was also impacted by the above-mentioned impact from covid-19.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 31%, primarily the result of higher profits from licensing.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash we project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding relating to new and existing investments, including skyshowtime, our streaming joint venture with comcast, under which both parent companies have committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. our planned spending in 2023 includes continued increased investment in our streaming services. we believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, which were $2.89 billion as of december 31, 2022, borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion credit facility described below, as well as access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
our funding for long-term obligations, including our long-term debt (see note 10), and the long-term portion of the other cash requirements discussed above, including contractual commitments for programming and talent (see ii-29
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
note 20) and lease obligations (see note 11), as well as those not yet committed to, will come from cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from noncore asset sales, including the planned sale of simon & schuster (see consolidated results of operations - 2022 vs. 2021, net earnings from discontinued operations), and our ability to refinance our debt. any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. to the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the credit facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. in addition, if necessary, we could increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending. we routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.
our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong balance sheet, cash flows, credit facility and credit ratings will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. the cost of any new borrowings is affected by market conditions and short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

restricted cash operating activities.  operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2022 was a net use of cash of $142 million compared to a net source of cash of $835 million for 2021. the use of cash in 2022 was mainly the result of significant investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, marketing and distribution costs. the decrease in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily driven by the decline in adjusted oibda, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes. cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $61 million for 2022 from $291 million for 2021, primarily resulting from lower earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the timing of production tax incentive receipts.

the decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly driven by our increased investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, advertising and marketing, and a higher level of production in 2021 as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 due to covid-19. the decrease was partially offset by higher collections and lower payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives, as well as lower payments for income taxes. cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $291 million for 2021 from $411 million for 2020, primarily due to a higher volume of production incentives received, lower adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a higher deduction associated with the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher payments associated with gains from dispositions, primarily from the sale of cbs studio center in 2021.
net cash flow provided by operating activities included payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives of $244 million, $294 million and $584 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. since the merger, we have invested in a number of transformation initiatives. initially, these were undertaken to realize synergies related to the merger. beginning in 2022, our transformation initiatives are related to future-state technology, including the unification and evolution of systems and platforms, and migration to the cloud. in addition, we are investing in future-state workspaces, including adapting our facilities to accommodate our hybrid and agile work model.
cash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of simon & schuster, and for 2022 also includes the receipt of the $200 million termination fee described under legal matters-litigation related to the proposed sale of simon & schuster.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $2.39 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion and redeemed, at par, our $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due february 2057. these redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. the interest rate on these debentures will reset on march 30, 2027, and every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year treasury rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of 3.999% from march 30, 2027, 4.249% from march 30, 2032 and 4.999% from march 30, 2047. these debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before march 30, 2027, or at par on march 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $1.99 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.11 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $128 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes and redeemed long-term debt totaling $2.77 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $126 million.
our 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due february 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until february 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month libor plus 3.899%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of libor and the passage of the adjustable interest rate (libor) act, signed into law on march 15, 2022, it is expected that the 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month cme term secured overnight financing rate (sofr). these debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.
the subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by standard & poor's rating services and fitch ratings inc., and a 25% equity credit by moody's investors service, inc.
the interest rate payable on our 3.45% senior notes due october 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if moody's investor services, inc. or s&p global ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. the interest rate on these senior notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade, up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. at december 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes was $124 million.
some of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. there is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.

credit facility at december 31, 2022, we had a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in january 2025 (the "credit facility"). the credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. we may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the credit facility. borrowing rates under the credit facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the u.s. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on euribor, sonia and tibor rates, respectively. the credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our consolidated total leverage ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. the consolidated total leverage ratio reflects the ratio of our consolidated indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our consolidated ebitda (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. on february 14, 2022, we amended our credit facility to modify the definition of the consolidated total leverage ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against consolidated indebtedness through june 2024. we met the covenant as of december 31, 2022.
at december 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the remaining availability under the credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $3.50 billion.
other bank borrowings at december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had bank borrowings under miramax's $300 million credit facility, which matures in april 2023, of $55 million and $35 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of 7.09% and 3.50%, respectively.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. the risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our audit committee. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. significant judgments used in ii-34
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales or bundled content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.
advertising revenues-advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. if a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. to the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. for contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.
affiliate revenues-the performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with mvpds and vmvpds, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. for agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to our customer's service. for agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. these agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the cbs television network ("network affiliates") for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate's service and the value of our programming.
content licensing revenues-for licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. for license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.
film and television production and programming costs costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. the costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.
we categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content. our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. the predominant ii-35
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
monetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. this reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.
for internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title's life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenues") for each title. management's judgment is required in estimating ultimate revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. these estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.
for television programming, our estimate of ultimate revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. these estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.
for feature films, our estimate of ultimate revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. prior to the release of feature films, we estimate ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. for films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. upon a film's initial release, we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on actual and expected future performance. our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. we also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information.
for acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.
for programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. such estimates require management's judgment and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. if initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. these estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.
for content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. if the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less than its unamortized costs. a change in the ii-36

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
monetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level, if the predominant monetization strategy is determined to be individual, or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated. in addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.
goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests we perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television fcc licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
fcc licenses-fcc licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. we consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the fcc licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. at december 31, 2022, we had 14 television markets with fcc license book values.
for our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of fcc licenses that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. for the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for nine of our television markets. for each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. the market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. we also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the fcc licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.
we performed a quantitative impairment test for the fcc licenses in the remaining five markets. the quantitative impairment test of fcc licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the greenfield discounted cash flow method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. the assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. the discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. the discount rate and the long-term growth rate were 8% and 1%, respectively.
the impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of fcc licenses in two of the markets were below their respective carrying values. accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $27 million to write down the carrying values of these fcc licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $184 million. the impairment charge, which is included within "depreciation and amortization" in the consolidated statement of operations and recorded within the tv media segment, was the result of a higher discount rate utilized in our annual impairment tests, reflecting the impacts of market volatility and higher interest rates. additionally, the estimated fair values of fcc licenses in the three remaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $787 million, were each within 10% of their respective carrying values. an increase to the discount rate of 15 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 20 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would ii-37
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
cause the fair value of fcc licenses in two of the markets to fall below their carrying values. for the third market, an increase to the discount rate of 26 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term rate of 36 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value to fall below its carrying value.
the estimated fair values of fcc licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. certain future events and circumstances, including continued market volatility and increases in interest rates, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. a further downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in an additional impairment and a noncash charge would be required. such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.
goodwill-goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. for our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that we estimate has a fair value that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. for the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units. for each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. the reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. for each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments within the industry. our assessment indicated that macroeconomic factors have negatively impacted inputs used in our most recent impairment tests, including discount rates, certain industry growth rates, and comparable company trading multiples. while this indicates that the estimated fair values of our reporting units have declined, considering the aggregation of all relevant factors, including the significant headroom in our most recent test performed in january 2022, which is described below, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units continues to be higher than their respective carrying amounts. therefore, performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.
certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, further increases in interest rates, prolonged weakness in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content and platforms could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. a significant adverse change in these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.
the annual test was performed on the six reporting units in place at october 31, 2022. in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of a management reorganization, the reporting units within our tv media segment changed from three to two reporting units. accordingly, we reallocated goodwill using a relative fair value approach and performed further qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on the two reporting units subsequent to the reallocation of goodwill, and concluded that the fair values of these reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values.

in the first quarter of 2022, in connection with changes to our management structure and the resulting change in operating segments, we reassessed our reporting units and reallocated goodwill from the four reporting units in place prior to the realignment to six reporting units, using a relative fair value approach. we performed goodwill impairment tests as of january 1, 2022 on the reporting units in place before and after the change.
for these impairment tests, we performed quantitative tests for three of the reporting units that existed prior to the change and five of the reporting units in place subsequent to the change. for the quantitative goodwill impairment test we calculate an estimated fair value to determine whether it exceeds the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. for one of the quantitative tests, we estimated fair value based on the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses, and for the remaining quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value based on both the present value of future cash flows ("discounted cash flow method") and the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses. the discounted cash flow method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. the assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. the terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. a discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. we utilized discount rates ranging from 9% to 13.5% and terminal values that were based on either growth rates ranging from 1% to 2% or revenue multiples ranging from 1.5x to 2.7x. traded and transaction values were determined using revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit as well as revenue and earnings multiples from recent transactions of these companies. the selected multiples consider each reporting unit's relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. based on the results of these impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charge was required.
for one of the reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment before and after the reporting unit change and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than its carrying amount.
legal matters estimates of liabilities related to legal issues and predecessor operations, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. we record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. while we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.

pensions pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. the expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. as of december 31, 2022, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to an increase in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets. a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $80 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2023 pension expense. a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $6 million to 2023 pension expense.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  when recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. while valuation allowances can require significant judgment, we believe the valuation allowance of $488 million at december 31, 2022 properly reduces our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. for positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated statement of operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. if a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. our income tax returns are routinely audited by u.s. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $303 million at december 31, 2022 is properly recorded.

legal matters general on an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, "litigation''). litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. however, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
stockholder matters litigation relating to the merger beginning in february 2020, three purported cbs stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the court of chancery of the state of delaware. in march 2020, the court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed bucks county employees' retirement fund and international union of operating engineers of eastern pennsylvania and delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. in april 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated class action and derivative complaint (as used in this paragraph, the "complaint") against shari e. redstone, nai, sumner m. redstone national amusements trust, members of the cbs board of directors (comprised of candace k. beinecke, barbara m. byrne, gary l. countryman, brian goldner, linda m. griego, robert n. klieger, martha l. minow, susan schuman, frederick o. terrell and strauss zelnick), former cbs president and acting chief executive officer joseph ianniello and the company as nominal defendant. the complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to cbs stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of august 13, 2019, between cbs and viacom (as amended, the "merger agreement"). the complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with mr. ianniello's compensation. the complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. in june 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. in january 2021, the court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. in december 2022, the court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against mr. klieger. discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. a six-day trial is scheduled to begin in june 2023. we believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.

investigation-related matters as announced in august 2018, the cbs board of directors retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about cbs' former chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer, leslie moonves, cbs news and cultural issues at cbs. in december 2018, the cbs board of directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the cbs board of directors' determination with respect to the termination of mr. moonves' employment.
in august 2018 and in october 2018, gene samit and john lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the u.s district court for the southern district of new york, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. in november 2018, the court entered an order consolidating the two actions. subsequently, in november 2018, the court appointed construction laborers pension trust for southern california as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. in february 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against cbs, certain current and former senior executives and members of the cbs board of directors. the consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of cbs class a common stock and class b common stock between september 26, 2016 and december 4, 2018. this action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants' purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. in april 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the court granted in part and denied in part in january 2020. with the exception of one statement made by mr. moonves at an industry event in november 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of cbs, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. we reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit for $14.75 million, which was paid by our insurers. the settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company, was granted final approval by the court in november 2022.
we also received subpoenas or requests for information from the new york county district attorney's office, the new york city commission on human rights, the new york state attorney general's office and the united states securities and exchange commission (the "sec") regarding the subject matter of the cbs board of directors' investigation and related matters, including with respect to cbs' related public disclosures. in november 2022, we entered into an assurance of discontinuance with the investor protection bureau of the new york state attorney general's office to resolve that matter. after credits for the settlement amount to be paid in the consolidated federal securities class action discussed above, and certain financial commitments to human resources-related programs made by cbs in connection with an earlier resolution with the civil rights bureau of the new york state attorney general's office, the company has made a payment of $7.25 million, which by agreement with the investor protection bureau will be distributed in connection with the federal securities class action settlement discussed above. the resolution with the investor protection bureau includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company. in december 2022, we received a termination letter from the sec, indicating that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the company. we may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future.
litigation related to stock offerings in august 2021, camelot event driven fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in new york supreme court, county of new york, and in november 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the "complaint"). the complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the company's class b common stock and 5.75% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in march 2021, and was ii-42

filed against the company, certain senior executives, members of our board of directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. the complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving archegos capital management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the company's stock price. in december 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the court subsequently ordered. on the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in january 2023. on february 7, 2023, the court dismissed all claims against the company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed.
litigation related to television station owners in september 2019, the company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. the lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about january 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the sherman antitrust act. the action, which names the company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys' fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. in october 2019, the company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court in november 2020. we have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. the settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company, will be subject to court approval.
litigation related to the proposed sale of simon & schuster in november 2021, the u.s. department of justice filed suit in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia to block our sale of the simon & schuster business to penguin random house pursuant to a share purchase agreement (the "purchase agreement"), dated november 24, 2020, between the company, certain of its subsidiaries, penguin random house and bertelsmann se & co. kgaa. in october 2022, following a bench trial, the court blocked the sale. in november 2022, we terminated the purchase agreement and subsequently received a $200 million termination fee.
claims related to former businesses asbestos we are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. we are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. in the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.
claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. we do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. as of december 31, 2022, we had pending approximately 21,580 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 27,770 as of december 31, 2021 and 30,710 as of december 31, 2020. during 2022, we received approximately 2,840 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 9,030 claims. we report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal ii-43

order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. our total costs for the years 2022 and 2021 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $57 million and $63 million, respectively. our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.
filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. the predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. we record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. while we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.
other from time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. in addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.
market risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. in accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in various countries outside the u.s., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the u.s. dollar. in order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the british pound, the euro, the canadian dollar and the australian dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-u.s. dollar denominated cash flows. the change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "other items, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. we manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $3.06 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. for 2022, $2.40 billion related to future production costs and $655 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. for 2021, $1.38 billion related to future production costs and $564 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.
interest risk interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. there were no interest rate hedges outstanding at december 31, 2022 or 2021 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.
at december 31, 2022, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $15.78 billion and the estimated fair value was $13.9 billion. a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.48 billion and $634 million, respectively.
credit risk we continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. however, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
our receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at december 31, 2022 or 2021, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.

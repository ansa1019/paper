item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with part i, item 1, business, our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
recent developments please refer to the "financial results and operating information" and "liquidity and capital resources" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report for additional information.
market conditions - we experienced earnings growth in 2022, compared with 2021, due primarily to increased producer activity across our operations, higher realized commodity prices, net of hedging and higher average fee rates. in 2023, we expect to benefit from higher volumes, our completed demicks lake iii natural gas processing plant and the expected completion of our mb-5 ngl fractionator, highlighting our extensive and integrated assets that are located in some of the most productive shale basins in the united states.
medford incident - on july 9, 2022, a fire occurred at our 210 mbbl/d medford, oklahoma, natural gas liquids fractionation facility. all personnel were safe and accounted for with temporary evacuations of local residents taken as a precautionary measure.
net income for the year ended december 31, 2022, includes the unfavorable impact of our $5 million property deductible and approximately $30 million of losses incurred associated with the 45-day waiting period for business interruption coverage. beginning in august 2022, we developed claims related to the medford incident and recorded accruals for expected insurance recoveries. the table below sets forth our 2022 insurance accruals associated with the medford incident:
2022 insurance accruals
(millions of dollars)
business interruption                                             $96.1
noncash property losses                                            45.6
medford response expenses                                           9.0
total insurance recoveries accrued (a)                           $150.7
(a) - we received a $100 million payment in the fourth quarter 2022, leaving a receivable balance at december 31, 2022, of $50.7 million.
our business interruption insurance includes coverage for (i) incurred costs and losses that are either unavoidable or incurred to mitigate or reduce losses and (ii) lost earnings. our business interruption insurance accruals in the table above primarily represent third-party fractionation costs and fully offset the actual losses incurred in 2022, subsequent to the 45-day waiting period.
we assessed the property damage to our facility and wrote off assets totaling $45.6 million, which represents the carrying value associated with certain damaged medford facility property. these noncash property losses are fully offset by insurance recoveries noted in the table above. we expect to continue to operate ngl pipeline assets in medford along with existing offices for regional operations. in addition, we are preserving certain medford assets for future potential ngl facilities that could be constructed in medford to enhance our ngl business as the market evolves. for additional information on the medford incident, see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
subsequent event - on january 9, 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the medford incident. under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022. the remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter 2023. the proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims.
in the first quarter 2023, we applied the $830 million received to our outstanding insurance receivable at december 31, 2022, of $50.7 million, and recorded a gain in operating income for the remaining $779.3 million. we expect our cash from operations in the remainder of 2023 and in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs and losses resulting from the medford incident for which we will no longer receive business interruption proceeds.
due to market demand and a more favorable completion schedule, we announced plans to construct a new 125 mbbl/d mb-6 ngl fractionator in mont belvieu, texas, instead of rebuilding our medford ngl fractionator at this time. the mb-6 fractionator will have the capability to produce purity ethane instead of the ethane/propane mix previously produced at the medford facility. the 125 mbbl/d capacity of the mb-6 fractionator is expected to be economically equivalent to the capacity lost at medford. in addition, our 125 mbbl/d mb-5 ngl fractionator remains on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter of 2023, which is expected to reduce the need for third-party fractionation while the new mb-6 fractionator is being constructed. until these projects are completed, we expect to continue to provide midstream services through existing arrangements with industry peers, along with our integrated ngl pipeline system between the mid-continent and gulf coast regions and our fractionation and storage assets.
ethane production - price differentials between ethane and natural gas can cause natural gas processors to extract ethane or leave it in the natural gas stream, known as ethane rejection. as a result of these ethane economics, ethane volumes on our system can fluctuate. in the second half of 2022, ethane prices decreased relative to natural gas prices, as overall demand decreased, and were further impacted by lower petrochemical plant utilization, both planned and unplanned. this resulted in higher ethane rejection across most basins where we operate, with the largest impact in the mid-continent region, compared with the first half of 2022. as utilization increases and demand for feedstock returns, we expect improvement in ethane economics; however, price fluctuations are expected to continue.
ethane volumes under long-term contracts delivered to our ngl system increased approximately 20 mbbl/d to an average of 450 mbbl/d in 2022, compared with 430 mbbl/d in 2021, due primarily to changes in ethane extraction economics. we estimate that there are more than 225 mbbl/d of discretionary ethane, consisting of more than 125 mbbl/d in the rocky mountain region and approximately 100 mbbl/d in the mid-continent region, that can be recovered and transported on our system.
growth projects - we operate an integrated, reliable and diversified network of ngl and natural gas gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation and storage assets connecting supply in the rocky mountain, mid-continent and permian regions with key market centers. our primary capital-growth projects are outlined in the table below:

(a) - excludes capitalized interest/afudc.
debt issuances and repayments - in november 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million, 6.1% senior unsecured notes due 2032. the net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $742 million. the proceeds were used primarily to repay all outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.
in july 2022, we redeemed the remaining $895.8 million of our 3.375% senior notes due october 2022 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand and short-term borrowings.
subsequent event - we elected to redeem our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due september 2023, with a redemption effective date in late february 2023. we expect the redemption price to equal 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which we will pay with cash on hand.
dividends - during 2022, we paid common stock dividends totaling $3.74 per share, which is consistent with the prior year. in february 2023, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.955 per share ($3.82 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. our dividend growth is primarily due to the increase in cash flows resulting from the growth of our operations.
financial results and operating information how we evaluate our operations management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. our consolidated financial metrics include: (1) operating income; (2) net income; (3) diluted eps; and (4) adjusted ebitda. we evaluate segment operating results using adjusted ebitda and our operating metrics, which include various volume and rate statistics that are relevant for the respective segment. these operating metrics allow investors to analyze the various components of segment financial results in terms of volumes and rate/price. management uses these metrics to analyze historical segment financial results and as the key inputs for forecasting and budgeting segment financial results. for additional information on our operating metrics, see the respective segment subsections of this "financial results and operating information" section.
non-gaap financial measures - adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap measure of our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, allowance for equity funds used during construction, noncash compensation expense and certain other noncash items. we believe this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry. adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income, eps or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap. additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.

see reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in the "non-gaap financial measures" section.
changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel in our consolidated statements of income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items, except where noted.
operating income for the year ended december 31, 2022, includes $96.1 million of business interruption insurance recoveries, which are included in the other operating (income) expense, net line item above, and an approximately $30 million unfavorable impact from the 45-day business interruption coverage waiting period related to the medford incident in our natural gas liquids segment.
2022 vs. 2021 - operating income increased $211.1 million primarily as a result of the following:
•natural gas gathering and processing - an increase of $127.7 million due primarily to higher realized commodity prices, net of hedging, and higher average fee rates and $53.8 million from higher volumes in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions; and
•natural gas liquids - an increase of $102.8 million in exchange services related primarily to higher average fee rates and higher volumes in the rocky mountain region and permian basin, offset partially by higher fuel and power costs and third-party fractionation costs; an increase of $46.2 million due to the unfavorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021 and $18.2 million in higher optimization and marketing earnings; offset by
•natural gas pipelines - a decrease of $134.7 million due to the favorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021, offset partially by increases of $92.1 million due primarily to higher storage and transportation services, higher average earnings on natural gas sales and higher pricing on compression services; and
•consolidated operating costs - an increase of $82.7 million due primarily to higher outside services, materials and supplies expense and property taxes, related primarily to the growth of our operations.
net income and diluted eps increased due primarily to the items discussed above, lower interest expense related to increased capitalized interest and lower debt balances and higher equity in net earnings from investments. these increases were offset partially by higher income taxes and losses related to the mark-to-market of investments associated with certain benefit plan investments.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to our capital-growth projects, including the construction of our demicks lake iii natural gas processing plant, our mb-5 fractionator and the viking compression project.

changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenue and cost of sales and fuel, and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.
2022 vs. 2021 - adjusted ebitda increased $147.5 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•an increase of $127.7 million due primarily to higher realized commodity prices, net of hedging, and average fee rates; and
•an increase of $53.8 million from higher volumes due primarily to increased producer activity in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions, offset partially by the impact of winter weather in the rocky mountain region in the second and fourth quarters of 2022; offset by
•an increase of $35.2 million in operating costs due primarily to higher materials and supplies expense due primarily to the growth of our operations and higher outside services.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to growth projects, including our demicks lake iii project.

(a) - includes volumes for consolidated entities only.
(b) - includes volumes we processed at company-owned and third-party facilities.
2022 vs. 2021 - our natural gas gathered and natural gas processed volumes increased due primarily to increased producer activity in the rocky mountain and mid-continent regions, offset partially by the unfavorable impact of winter weather in the rocky mountain region in the second and fourth quarters of 2022.
our average fee rate increased due primarily to increased contribution of volumes on higher fee contracts in the williston basin and inflation-based escalators in our contracts. also, for certain fee with pop contracts, our contractual fees increased due to production volumes, delivery pressures, or commodity prices relative to specified contractual thresholds.

natural gas liquids growth projects - our natural gas liquids segment invests in projects to transport, fractionate, store and deliver to market centers ngl supply from shale and other resource development areas. our growth strategy is focused around connecting diversified supply basins from the rocky mountain region through the mid-continent region and the permian basin with purity ngls demand from the petrochemical and refining industries and ngl export demand in the gulf coast. see "growth projects" in the "recent developments" section for discussion of our capital-growth projects.
in 2022, we connected one third-party natural gas processing plant in the permian basin and one raw feed truck terminal in the mid-continent region to our ngl system. in addition, one third-party natural gas processing plant in the permian basin connected to our system was expanded.

changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both revenues and cost of sales and fuel, and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between these line items.
adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2022, includes $96.1 million of business interruption insurance recoveries, which are included in the other line item above, and an approximately $30 million unfavorable impact from the 45-day business interruption coverage waiting period related to the medford incident.
2022 vs. 2021 - adjusted ebitda increased $131.6 million primarily as a result of the following:
•an increase of $102.8 million in exchange services (excluding the impact of winter storm uri discussed below) due primarily to:
◦$186.3 million in higher average fee rates, primarily as a result of inflation-based and fuel cost escalators in our contracts,
◦$50.1 million in higher volumes primarily in the rocky mountain region and permian basin, offset partially by lower volumes in the mid-continent region, offset by
◦$129.9 million in higher costs, primarily fuel and power costs and third-party fractionation costs. a portion of the third-party fractionation costs relate to the 45-day medford incident business interruption coverage waiting period, and
◦$12.9 million related to recognition of proceeds previously considered a gain contingency in 2021; and
•an increase of $46.2 million in exchange services due to the unfavorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021;
•an increase of $18.2 million in optimization and marketing due primarily to wider location and commodity price differentials, offset partially by nonrecurring activities in the first quarter 2021 during winter storm uri; and
•an increase of $13.6 million in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the overland pass pipeline; offset by
•an increase of $48.8 million in operating costs due primarily to higher property taxes associated with our completed capital-growth projects and higher outside services.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to capital-growth projects, including our mb-5 fractionator.

(a) - represents physical raw feed volumes for which we provide transportation and/or fractionation services.
we generally expect ethane volumes to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in overall ngl production. however, ethane volumes may experience growth or decline greater than corresponding growth or decline in overall ngl production due to ethane economics causing producers to extract or reject ethane.
2022 vs. 2021 - volumes increased due primarily to increased ngl production in the rocky mountain region and permian basin, and higher ethane volumes from incentivized ethane recovery in the rocky mountain region, offset partially by decreased ethane recovery in the mid-continent region due to ethane economics. volumes also benefited from the unfavorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021, offset partially by the impact of winter weather in the rocky mountain region in the second and fourth quarters of 2022.
natural gas pipelines growth projects - our natural gas pipelines segment invests in projects that provide transportation and storage services to end users. in december 2022, our saguaro connector pipeline l.l.c. subsidiary filed a presidential permit application with the ferc to construct and operate new international border-crossing facilities at the u.s. and mexico border. the proposed border facilities would connect upstream with a potential intrastate pipeline, the saguaro connector pipeline, which would be owned and operated by oneok. additionally, the proposed border facilities would connect at the international boundary with a new pipeline under development in mexico for delivery to a liquefied natural gas export facility on the west coast of mexico. the final investment decision on the pipeline is expected by mid-2023.

see reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in the "non-gaap measures" section.
2022 vs. 2021 - adjusted ebitda decreased $39.4 million primarily as a result of the following:
•a decrease of $134.7 million due to the favorable impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021 on natural gas sales of volumes previously held in inventory, interruptible transportation revenue and park and loan revenue; and
•an increase of $12.0 million in operating expenses due primarily to higher outside services, offset by
•an increase of $51.5 million in storage services due primarily to higher storage rates on renegotiated contracts;
•an increase of $23.1 million in transportation services due primarily to higher interruptible revenue, excluding the impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021 noted above, and higher firm transportation revenue;
•an increase of $17.5 million due primarily to higher average earnings on natural gas sales of volumes previously held in inventory, excluding the impact of winter storm uri in the first quarter 2021 noted above, and higher pricing on compression services; and
•an increase of $10.4 million from higher equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to increased volumes on northern border and higher firm transportation rates on roadrunner.
capital expenditures increased in 2022 due primarily to capital-growth projects, including the viking compression project.

in april 2022, the ferc initiated a review of guardian's rates pursuant to section 5 of the natural gas act. in august 2022, guardian reached a settlement in principle with the participants in the section 5 rate case. the ferc approved the settlement in february 2023, which will result in a future reduction of rates. we do not expect the reduced rates to have a material impact on our results of operations.

contingencies see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a discussion of regulatory and environmental matters.
other legal proceedings - we are a party to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. while the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources general - our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 billion credit agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements.
on january 9, 2023, we reached an agreement with our insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the medford incident. under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to resolve the claims for total insurance payments of $930 million, $100 million of which was received in 2022. the remaining $830 million was received in the first quarter 2023. the proceeds serve as settlement for property damage, business interruption claims to the date of settlement and as payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims. we expect our cash from operations in the remainder of 2023 and in 2024 to be impacted by incurred costs and losses resulting from the medford incident for which we will no longer receive business interruption proceeds.
we expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt. we believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which expires in june 2027, and access to $1.0 billion available through our "at-the-market" equity program. as of the date of this report, no shares have been sold through our "at-the-market" equity program.
we may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt and interest-rate swaps. for additional information on our interest-rate swaps, see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
guarantees and cash management - we and oneok partners are issuers of certain public debt securities. we guarantee certain indebtedness of oneok partners, and oneok partners and the intermediate partnership guarantee certain of our indebtedness. the guarantees in place for our and oneok partners' indebtedness are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of outstanding securities. liabilities under the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. as oneok partners and the intermediate partnership are consolidated subsidiaries of oneok, separate financial statements for the guarantors are not required, as long as the alternative disclosure required by rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. the intermediate partnership holds all of oneok partners' interests and equity in its subsidiaries, which are nonguarantors, and substantially all the assets and operations reside with nonguarantor operating subsidiaries. therefore, as allowed under rule 13-01, we have excluded the summarized financial information for each issuer and guarantor as the combined financial information of the subsidiary issuer and parent guarantor, excluding our ownership of all the interests in oneok partners, reflect no material assets, liabilities or results of operations, apart from the guaranteed indebtedness. for additional information on our and oneok partners' indebtedness, see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
we use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our nonguarantor operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group. our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to ferc regulations or their operating agreements. under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.
short-term liquidity - our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our equity-method investments, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 billion credit agreement.
we had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $503.9 million and $810.2 million as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, respectively. although working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) debt and equity issuances, (b) the funding of capital expenditures, (c) scheduled debt repayments, and (d) accounts receivable and payable; and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances, our working capital deficits at december 31, 2022 and 2021, were driven primarily by current maturities of long-term debt. we may have working capital deficits in future periods as we continue to repay long-term debt. we do not expect this working capital deficit to have an adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.
at december 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under our $2.5 billion credit agreement and $220.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.
in june 2022, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which matures in june 2027. as of december 31, 2022, we are in compliance with all covenants of our $2.5 billion credit agreement.
for additional information on our $2.5 billion credit agreement, see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
long-term financing - in addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes. other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.
debt issuances - in november 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million, 6.1% senior unsecured notes due 2032. the net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $742 million. the proceeds were used primarily to repay all outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.
in june 2022, guardian entered into a $120 million unsecured term loan agreement. during the second quarter 2022, guardian drew the full $120 million available under the agreement and used the proceeds to repay intercompany debt with oneok.
debt repayments - in july 2022, we redeemed the remaining $895.8 million of our 3.375% senior notes due october 2022 at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with cash on hand and short-term borrowings.
subsequent event - we elected to redeem our $425 million, 5.0% senior notes due september 2023, with a redemption effective date in late february 2023. we expect the redemption price to equal 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which we will pay with cash on hand.
material commitments - we have material cash commitments related to our capital expenditures, senior notes and corresponding interest payments, which we expect to fund through our sources of cash inflows discussed above. our senior notes and interest payments are discussed in note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report. we also have cash commitments related to transportation, storage and other commercial contracts, as well as our financial and physical derivative obligations, which we expect to fund with cash from operations.
capital expenditures - we classify expenditures that are expected to generate additional revenue, return on investment or significant operating or environmental efficiencies as growth capital expenditures. maintenance capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our existing assets and operations and do not generate additional revenues. maintenance capital expenditures are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows and short- and long-term debt.
the following table sets forth our growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding afudc, for the periods indicated:

capital expenditures increased in 2022, compared with 2021, due primarily to our capital-growth projects, including the construction of our demicks lake iii natural gas processing plant, our mb-5 fractionator and the viking compression project. see discussion of our announced capital-growth projects in the "recent developments" section.
we expect total capital expenditures, excluding afudc and capitalized interest, of $1.3-$1.5 billion in 2023.
credit ratings - our long-term debt credit ratings as of february 21, 2023, are shown in the table below:
rating agency        long-term rating        short-term rating       outlook moody's              baa3                    prime-3                 positive s&amp;p              bbb                     a-2                     stable fitch                bbb                     f2                      stable our credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile or potential transactions. the most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-ebitda ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity. if our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under our $2.5 billion credit agreement could increase and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur. in the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which expires in 2027. an adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $2.5 billion credit agreement.
in the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit. in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties' evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.
dividends - holders of our common stock share equally in any common stock dividends declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock. in 2022, we paid common stock dividends of $3.74 per share, which is consistent with prior year. in february 2023, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.955 per share ($3.82 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year.
our series e preferred stock pays quarterly dividends on each share of series e preferred stock, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, at a rate of 5.5% per year. in 2022, we paid dividends of $1.1 million for the series e preferred stock. in february 2023, we paid quarterly dividends totaling $0.3 million for the series e preferred stock.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, our cash flows from operations exceeded dividends paid by $1.2 billion. we expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends. to the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize cash on hand from other sources of short- and long-term liquidity to fund a portion of our dividends.
cash flow analysis we use the indirect method to prepare our consolidated statements of cash flows. under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income. these reconciling items can include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, deferred income taxes, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.

operating cash flows - operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our ngls and natural gas inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.
2022 vs. 2021 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, increased $214.5 million due primarily to higher net income resulting from higher realized commodity prices, net of hedging, and higher average fee rates in our natural gas gathering and processing segment and higher exchange services in our natural gas liquids segment. these increases were offset partially by the impact of winter storm uri in our natural gas pipelines segment in the first quarter 2021, as discussed in "financial results and operating information."
the changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows $3.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared with a decrease of $141.8 million for the same period in 2021. the change is due primarily to changes in risk management assets and liabilities, which include the gains associated with the settlements of forward-starting interest rate swaps in 2022 and changes in the fair value of risk-management assets and liabilities; accounts receivable resulting from the timing of receipt of cash from customers and ngls and natural gas in inventory, both of which vary from period to period and with changes in commodity prices; offset partially by changes in accounts payable, which also vary from period to period with changes in commodity prices, and from the timing of payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties and changes in other assets and liabilities.
investing cash flows
2022 vs. 2021 - cash used in investing activities increased $474.0 million due primarily to capital expenditures related to our capital-growth projects.
financing cash flows
2022 vs. 2021 - cash used in financing activities decreased $566.2 million due primarily to the issuance of long-term debt in 2022.
cash flow analysis for the year ended december 31, 2021 vs. 2020 - the cash flow analysis for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared with the year ended december 31, 2020, is included in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our 2021 annual report on form 10-k, which is available via the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.oneok.com.
impact of new accounting standards information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are defined as those estimates and policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. we have discussed the development and selection of our estimates and critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors. see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for the description of our accounting policies and additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.
derivatives and risk-management activities - we utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship. when possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes. for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings.
we assess hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective. we do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges. however, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings. additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings. for more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
see notes a, c and d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk-management activities.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets - we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of july 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time. as part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. if further testing is necessary or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a step 1 analysis for goodwill impairment.
in a step 1 analysis, an assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
we assess our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.
our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates, such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. to estimate undiscounted future cash flows of long-lived assets, we may apply a probability-weighted approach that incorporates different assumptions and potential outcomes related to the underlying long-lived assets. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist. to estimate the fair value of these assets, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach. under the income approach, our discounted cash flow analysis includes the following inputs that are not readily available: a discount rate reflective of industry cost of capital, our estimated contract rates, volumes, operating margins, operating and maintenance costs and capital expenditures. under the market approach, our inputs include ebitda multiples, which are estimated from recent peer acquisition transactions, and forecasted ebitda, which incorporates inputs similar to those used under the income approach. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.
see notes a, e and f of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment - our property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method that incorporates management assumptions regarding useful economic lives and residual values. as we place additional assets in service, our estimates related to depreciation expense have become more significant and changes in estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on our results of operations. at the time we place our assets in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation expense prospectively. examples of such circumstances include changes in (i) competition, (ii) laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset, (iii) technology that render an asset obsolete, (iv) expected salvage values, (v) results of rate cases or rate settlements on regulated assets and (vi) forecasts of the remaining economic life for the resource basins where our assets are located, if any. for the fiscal years presented in this form 10-k, no changes were made to the determinations of useful lives that would have a material effect on the timing of depreciation expense in future periods.
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of property, plant and equipment.

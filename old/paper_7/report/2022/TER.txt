item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a leading global supplier of automated test equipment and robotics products. we design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems and robotics products. our automatic test systems are used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. our robotics products include collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots ("amrs") used by global manufacturing, logistics and industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and
28
material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs. our automatic test equipment and robotics products and services include:
•   semiconductor test ("semiconductor test") systems;

•   storage and system level test ("storage test") systems, defense/aerospace ("defense/aerospace") test instrumentation and systems and circuit-board test and inspection ("production board test") systems (collectively these products represent "system test");

•   wireless test ("wireless test") systems; and

•   robotics ("robotics") products.

the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. a few customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer's supply partners. we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.
in 2022, the demand in the mobility and compute segments of our semiconductor test business was lower due to end market slowdown in these segments as well as a slower technology transition in one of our largest end-markets. while the depth of the slowdown and the timing of the recovery are uncertain, we expect the ramp of 3 nanometer process technology starting in 2023 followed by gate-all-around process technology, increasing multichip packaging, additional device complexity and unit growth will drive additional demand for test over our four year forecast period.
our robotics segment consists of universal robots a/s ("ur"), a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms and mobile industrial robots a/s ("mir"), a leading maker of amrs for industrial automation. in september 2022, we merged mir and autoguide, llc ("autoguide"), a maker of high payload amrs, to become a single supplier of amrs. the market for our robotics segment products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises ("smes") throughout the world. we expect robotics sales channel expansion combined with new products to drive the growth in 2023.
both our test and robotics businesses may continue to be influenced by supply constraints, which could impact our revenue and costs in 2023. in 2022, inflation had minimal effect on our results. in 2022, we were unable to supply approximately $20 million of revenue in our test businesses for which we had customer demand.
our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars. while the majority of our revenues are in u.s. dollars, approximately 70 percent of our robotics revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. in 2022, the strengthening of the u.s. dollar was a factor in lower than forecasted revenues in our robotics segment. continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar would negatively affect robotics revenue growth in 2023.
our corporate strategy continues to focus on profitably gaining market share in our test businesses through the introduction of differentiated products that target expanding segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our robotics businesses. we plan to continue investing in our growth while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and using capital for acquisitions.
impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business during the novel coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic, government authorities implemented numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on
29
gatherings or social distancing requirements, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, vaccination and testing mandates, and business limitations and shutdowns. additionally, we took proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, and to comply with all government orders around the globe. the spread of covid-19 caused us to modify our business practices, which included implementing social distancing protocols, limiting employee travel and requiring employees to work remotely. these measures impacted our day-to-day operations and disrupted our business, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers. due to the covid-19 pandemic, there has also been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets. we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of february 22, 2023, the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe the covid-19 pandemic, and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response, adversely impacted our results of operations, including by increasing costs, but we cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact to our 2022 and 2021 financial results or to our future financial results. in addition, the pandemic has disrupted our contract manufacturers and suppliers, and has resulted in some instances in short-term cost increases to meet customer demand. while a continuation of the pandemic may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, we expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational, at sufficient capacity to support production demand. we are monitoring our operations closely in an effort to avoid any potential productivity loss caused by responses to the covid-19 pandemic.
we experienced interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. our suppliers have faced and may continue to face difficulties maintaining operations in light of covid-19 disruptions and government-ordered restrictions. our supply chain team, and our suppliers, continue to manage numerous supply, production, and logistics obstacles caused by the pandemic. there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. the covid-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt our ability to obtain components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and in some instances resulting in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining components and shipping finished goods to customers.
we will continue to monitor the covid-19 pandemic. we may take further actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers. in these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. as a result, given the uncertain nature of this situation, we are not able to accurately predict the full extent of the impact of covid-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows in the future.
supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures the global supply shortage of electrical components, including semiconductor chips, continued to impact our supply chain in 2022. as a result, we experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in our lead times and costs for certain components for certain of our products. in addition, in 2022, inflationary pressures contributed to increased costs for product components and wage inflation, which had minimal impact on our cost of products, gross margin and profit for the year. our supply chain team, and our suppliers, continue to manage numerous supply, production, and logistics obstacles. in an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs due to investment in supply chain resiliency and to secure available inventory or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with semiconductor suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. we have also sourced components from additional suppliers and multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and finished goods inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced. however, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacities from our current or new suppliers and contract manufacturers, on
30
acceptable terms or at all, or successfully manage our purchase commitments and inventory for components, our ability to deliver our products to our customers in the desired quantities, at competitive prices or in a timely manner may be negatively impacted for 2023.
impact of russia's invasion of ukraine on our business russia's invasion of ukraine, in february 2022, did not have a significant direct impact on our business as we have minimal business in russia and ukraine. however, following the invasion, the u.s. and other countries imposed significant sanctions against the russian government and many russian companies and individuals. although we do not have significant operations in russia, the sanctions and russia's response to the sanctions, have impacted our business in other countries and could have a negative impact on our future revenue and supply chain, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. in addition, the global economic uncertainty following the invasion, sanctions and russia's response to the sanctions could impact demand for our products.
impact of october 7, 2022 u.s. department of commerce regulations on our business on october 7, 2022, the u.s. department of commerce published new regulations restricting the export to china of advanced semiconductors, supercomputer technology, equipment for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors and components and technology for the manufacturing in china of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment. the new restrictions are lengthy and complex. we continue to assess the impact of these regulations on our business. we have determined that restrictions on the sale of semiconductor testers in china to test certain advanced semiconductors will impact our sales to certain companies in china. several multinational companies manufacturing these advanced semiconductors in china have obtained one-year licenses allowing suppliers such as teradyne to continue to provide testers to the facilities operated by these companies. we expect that other companies manufacturing advanced semiconductors in china will not receive licenses, thereby restricting our ability to provide testers to the facilities operated by these companies that do not receive a license. we are also filing license requests to sell to and support certain customers in china for certain end uses that, if granted, may reduce the impact of these restrictions on our business. at this time, we do not know the impact these end user and end use restrictions will have on our business in china or on future revenues. in addition to the specific restrictions impacting our business, the regulations may have an adverse impact on certain actual or potential customers and on the global semiconductor industry. to the extent the regulations impact actual and potential customers or disrupt the global semiconductor industry, our business and revenues will be adversely impacted. we also have determined that the restrictions on the export of certain u.s. origin components and technology for use in the development and production in china of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment impact our manufacturing and development operations in china. we have received a temporary authorization from the u.s. department of commerce allowing us to continue our manufacturing and development operations in china until the u.s. department of commerce issues a license to replace this temporary authorization. we cannot assess the likelihood or timing of receiving this license. in addition to requesting a license, we are implementing procedures for minimizing the impact of these new regulations on our operations in china, but there is no assurance that these procedures will succeed.
see part ii-item 1a, "risk factors," included herein for updates to our risk factors regarding risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and international conflicts.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. for a full description of our accounting policies related to the below items refer to note b. accounting policies, included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
31
critical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management. changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. these estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition in accordance with asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asc 606"), we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. our determination of revenue requires judgment in the determination of performance obligations and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations. we often sell bundled orders that include both product and services or multiple different products within the same order. we evaluate each of the deliverables to determine if it meets the definition of a performance obligation, which requires that it is capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. this determination is based on an assessment of contractual rights of the contract and the ability of the performance obligation to perform on its own or with readily available resources. in bundled transactions we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including standalone transactions, market information and other observable inputs.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a first-in, first-out basis or net realizable value. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written down to estimated net realizable value. forecasted demand information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenues. the demand forecast is based on assumptions around the product life and customer and market forecasts.
retirement and postretirement plans we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.
in developing the expected return on u.s. qualified pension plan ("u.s. plan") assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. we believe that 2.0% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2022. the december 31, 2022 asset allocation for our u.s. plan was 94% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the u.s. plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the u.s. plan's expected cash flows and was 4.95% at december 31, 2022, up from 2.65% at december 31, 2021. we estimate that in 2023 we will recognize approximately $0.4 million of pension expense for the u.s. plan. the u.s. plan pension expense estimate for 2023 is based on a 4.95%
32
discount rate and a 4.75% return on assets. future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.
goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. we review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. impairment of intangible and long-lived assets would result in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. the calculated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible or long-lived asset is dependent upon discounted cash flow ("dcf") models, discount rates, and market multiples. dcf models rely on our forecasted mid-term plans which are subjective based on customer or market conditions and can change materially. we utilize third party specialists when determining discount rates and selected market multiples. a change in any of these key assumptions could result in a reporting unit, intangible asset, or long-lived asset being impaired in a future period.
convertible debt we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") asu 2020-06 - "debt-debt with conversion and other options and derivatives and hedging-contracts in entity's own equity," on january 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. as a result of adoption, we recorded an increase of $1.4 million to current debt for unsettled shares, an increase of $1.8 million to deferred tax assets, an increase of $6.6 million to long-term debt for unamortized debt discount, and an increase to retained earnings of $94.6 million for the reclassification of the equity component. mezzanine equity representing unsettled shares value was reduced to zero and additional paid-in capital was reduced by $100.8 million. in accordance with asu 2020-06, we account for a convertible debt instrument as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. unsettled shares are recorded in current debt, and there is no recognition of a debt discount, which was previously amortized to interest expense. settled shares reduce the outstanding debt balance in an amount equal to the cash paid, but do not result in any gain or loss on extinguishment. we use the if-converted method in the diluted eps calculation for convertible instruments.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. evaluating the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740, "accounting for income taxes" is a key judgment in the valuation of income taxes. this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized.
results of operations information pertaining to fiscal year 2020 results of operations, including a year-to-year comparison against fiscal year 2021, was included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021 under part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations," which was filed with the sec on february 23, 2022. this information is incorporated by reference herein.

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on-hand and on-order inventory positions. forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenues. this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written down to estimated net realizable value.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded an inventory provision of $31.5 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. of the $31.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $21.5 million was related to semiconductor test, $4.6 million was related to wireless test, $3.7 million was related to robotics, and $1.7 million was related to system test.

the decrease in income before income taxes in semiconductor test was driven primarily by lower revenues in mobile and high performance compute processor applications, partially offset by lower variable compensation. the increase in income before income taxes in system test was primarily due to higher sales in defense/aerospace and in production board test, partially offset by a decline in storage test sales of system level testers. the decrease in income before income taxes in wireless test was driven primarily by lower sales in cellular test products partially offset by elevated sales in ultra-wide band test products. the decrease in income before income taxes in robotics, was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and greater spending, partially offset by higher revenue for collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots. the change in income before income taxes in corporate and eliminations of $42.9 million was due primarily to $28.8 million of losses on convertible debt conversions recognized in 2021 and an increase of $23.4 million in pension actuarial gains in 2022.
income taxes income tax expense for 2022 and 2021, totaled $124.9 million and $146.4 million, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 14.9% and 12.6%, respectively.
the increase in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 is primarily attributable to a shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increased the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, increases in expense from u.s. global low-taxed income and increases in expense
38
from non-deductible officer compensation. these increases in expense were partially offset by increases in benefits from the u.s. foreign derived intangible income deduction and tax credits.
we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were $16.0 million or $0.09 per diluted share and $33.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, respectively. in november 2020, we entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31, 2020. the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2025.
capital resources and material cash requirements our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased by $495 million in 2022 to $1,005 million. cash decreased due to stock repurchases in the amount of $752 million, quarterly cash dividend payments in the amount of $70 million, payments of convertible debt principal in the amount of $67 million partially offset by cash generated by our global operations.
operating activities during 2022 provided cash of $577.9 million. changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $272.6 million. this was due to a $170.9 million increase in operating assets and a $101.7 million decrease in operating liabilities.

in january 2022, may 2022, august 2022 and november 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share. total dividend payments in 2022 were $69.7 million.
in january 2021, may 2021, august 2021 and november 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. total dividend payments in 2021 were $66.0 million.
in january 2021, our board of directors approved a repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion of common stock. in 2022, we repurchased 7.3 million shares of common stock for $752.1 million at an average price of $103.69 per share. in 2021, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for $600.0 million at an average price of $125.74 per share. the cumulative repurchases as of december 31, 2022, under this repurchase program were 12.0 million shares of common stock for $1,352.1 million at an average price per share of $112.44.
in january 2023, our board of directors cancelled the 2021 repurchase program and approved a new repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion of common stock. we intend to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock in 2023 subject to market conditions.
while we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.
on may 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400 million. on december 10, 2021, the credit agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to december 10, 2026. on october 5, 2022, the credit agreement was amended to increase the amount of the credit facility to $750.0 million from $400.0 million. as of february 22, 2023, we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.
we expect operations to continue to be the primary source of cash to operate the business and meet material cash commitments, including any payments of convertible debt principal, our stock repurchase program, our quarterly dividends, our office lease obligations, contractual obligations related to inventory purchases and the construction of new facilities. we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings. at this time, the covid-19 pandemic has not had an impact on our liquidity, but there is no assurance that continued impacts resulting from the pandemic will not have an adverse effect in the future.
at december 31, 2022, our future contractual obligations were related to debt, leases, retirement plan liabilities, deferred tax benefits, and purchase obligations. see note j. "debt", note i. "leases", note p. "retirement plans", and note s. "income taxes" of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for information about those obligations, which notes are incorporated by reference into this section. our purchase obligations were approximately $654.8 million, with $570.3 million expected to be paid within twelve months.

retirement plans asc 715-20, "compensation-retirement benefits-defined benefit plans," requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 715-20. the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans' assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31. for other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, our pension income, which includes the u.s. qualified pension plan ("u.s. plan"), certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries, and a u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit plan, was approximately $19.7 million. pension income/expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.
in developing the expected return on u.s. plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. we believe that 2.0% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2022. the december 31, 2022 asset allocation for our u.s. plan was 94% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.
we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the u.s. plan is based on the ftse pension index adjusted for the u.s. plan's expected cash flows and was 4.95% at december 31, 2022, up from 2.65% at december 31, 2021. we estimate that in 2023, we will recognize approximately $0.4 million of pension expense for the u.s. plan. the u.s. plan pension expense estimate for 2023 is based on a 4.95% discount rate and a 4.75% return on assets. future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.
as of december 31, 2022, our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost.
the assets of the u.s. plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. u.s. plan assets have decreased from $149.6 million at december 31, 2021 to $111.8 million at december 31, 2022, while the u.s. plan's liability decreased from $134.5 million at december 31, 2021 to $100.0 million at december 31, 2022. in 2022, the decrease in plan assets and plan liability was due to an increase in interest rates. in 2020, the accrued pension obligations for approximately 115 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company and resulted in a $24.4 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets. we recorded $2.2 million of pension actuarial loss and a settlement loss of $0.5 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction.
our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. during 2022, we made contributions of $3.2 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan, and $0.9 million to certain qualified plans for non-u.s.
41
subsidiaries. in 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $3.1 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan. contributions to be made in 2023 to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $1.3 million.
equity compensation plans in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note q: "stock-based compensation" in notes to consolidated financial statements, we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan (the "2006 equity plan") under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25, 2006.
at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder. at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12, 2025. at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 7, 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 3.0 million, for an aggregate of 33.4 million shares issuable thereunder.

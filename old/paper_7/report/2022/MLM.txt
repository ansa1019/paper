item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introductory overview martin marietta materials, inc. (the company or martin marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company, with 2022 total revenues of $6.16 billion and 2022 net earnings from continuing operations attributable to martin marietta of $856.3 million. these results were achieved in part by supplying aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 350 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states, canada and the bahamas. martin marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in certain markets where the company has a leading aggregates position. specifically, the company has two cement plants in texas, ready mixed concrete operations in arizona, california and texas, and asphalt operations in arizona, california, colorado and minnesota. paving services are offered in california and colorado. the company also has one cement plant, related cement distribution terminals and ready mixed concrete operations in california that are classified as assets held for sale and reported as discontinued operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
the company's heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. the aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the "building materials" business.
as more fully discussed in the consolidated strategic objectives section, geography is critically important for the building materials business. the company conducts its building materials business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: east group and west group. the east group, consisting of the east and central divisions, provides aggregates and asphalt products. the west group is comprised of the southwest and west divisions and provides aggregates, cement, downstream products and paving services. further, the following five states accounted for 64% of the building materials business 2022 total revenues: texas, colorado, north carolina, minnesota and california.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations magnesia specialties the company operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio. the magnesia specialties business produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications. it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and soil stabilization. magnesia specialties' products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide.
consolidated strategic objectives the company's strategic planning process, or strategic operating analysis and review (soar), provides the framework for execution of martin marietta's long-term strategic plan. guided by this framework and considering the cyclicality of the building materials business, the company determines capital allocation priorities to maximize long-term shareholder value creation. the company's strategy includes ongoing evaluation of aggregates-led opportunities of scale in new domestic markets (i.e., platform acquisitions) and expansion through acquisitions that complement existing operations (i.e., bolt-on acquisitions). to that effect, the company has invested nearly $8.0 billion in acquisitions since the launch of soar in 2010. the company finances such opportunities with the goal of preserving its financial flexibility by having a leverage ratio (consolidated net debt-to-consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or ebitda) within a range of 2.0 times to 2.5 times within a reasonable period of time, typically within 18 months, following the completion of a debt-financed transaction. soar also includes the identification and potential disposition of assets that are not consistent with stated strategic goals. notably, in 2022, the company divested its colorado and central texas ready mixed concrete businesses and certain west coast cement and ready mixed concrete operations, refining its product mix and improving margin profile, while providing balance sheet flexibility.
the company, by purposeful design, will continue to be an aggregates-led business that focuses on markets with strong, underlying growth fundamentals where it can sustain or achieve a leading market position. in fact, aggregates product gross profit represented 69% of 2022 total consolidated products and services gross profit. as part of its long-term strategic plan, the company may also pursue strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. for martin marietta, strategic cement and targeted downstream operations are located in vertically-integrated markets where the company has, or envisions, among other things, a clear path toward a leading aggregates position.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally, the company's building materials are both sourced and sold locally. as a result, geography is critically important when assessing market attractiveness and growth opportunities. attractive geographies generally exhibit (a) population growth and/or high population density, both of which are drivers of heavy-side building materials consumption; (b) business and employment diversity, drivers of greater economic stability; and (c) a superior state financial position, a driver of public infrastructure investment.
population growth and density are assessed based on a site's proximity to one of the megaregions in the united states. megaregions are large networks of metropolitan population centers covering thousands of square miles. according to america 2050, a planning and policy program of the regional plan association, a majority of the nation's population and economic growth through 2050 will occur in 11 megaregions. the company has a meaningful presence in ten of the megaregions. as evidence of the successful execution of soar, the company's leading positions in the texas triangle, colorado's front range, northern and southern california and arizona's sun corridor megaregions, its growth platform in the southern portion of the northeast megaregion and its enhanced position in the piedmont atlantic megaregion, primarily in the atlanta area, are the results of acquisitions since 2011. the company has a legacy presence in the southeastern portion of the great lakes megaregion, encompassing operations in indiana and ohio, as well as the florida megaregion and the gulf coast megaregion in texas.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with respect to business and employment diversity, the company focuses its geographic footprint along significant transportation and commerce corridors, particularly where land is readily available for the development of fulfillment and/or data centers. the retail sector (both e-commerce and brick and mortar) values transportation corridors, as logistics and distribution are critical considerations for construction supporting that industry. in addition, technology companies view these areas as attractive locations for data centers.
the company considers a state's financial health rating, as issued by s&p global ratings, in determining the opportunities and attractiveness of areas for expansion or development. the company's top ten revenue-generating states have been evaluated and scored a financial health rating of aa- or higher, where aaa is the highest score. the company also reviews the state's ability to secure additional infrastructure funding and financing.
in line with the company's strategic objectives, management's overall focus includes:
•upholding the company's commitment to its mission, vision and values
•navigating effectively through construction cycles to balance investment decisions against expected shipment volumes
•tracking shifts in population trends, as well as local, state and national economic conditions, to ensure changing trends are reflected against the execution of the strategic plan
•integrating acquired businesses efficiently to maximize the return on the investment
•allocating capital in a manner consistent with the following long-standing priorities while maintaining financial flexibility
─acquisitions
─organic capital investment
─return of cash to shareholders through both meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2022 performance highlights achieved industry-leading safety performance:
•record company-wide lost-time incident rate (ltir) of 0.15, the sixth consecutive year of world-class or better ltir thresholds
•record company-wide total injury incident rate (tiir) of 0.78, the second consecutive year of world-class or better tiir thresholds achieved record financial performance:
the company achieved record total revenues, products and services revenues, consolidated gross profit and adjusted ebitda (defined in results of operations section), benefiting from double-digit pricing growth across all product lines of the building materials business and contributions from acquired operations, which more than offset increased inflationary pressure from rising input costs and divestiture impacts on an absolute basis. further, 2022 represented the eleventh consecutive year of annual growth for products and services revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted ebitda. the company's commitment to safety and operational and commercial excellence resulted in the following financial performance from continuing operations (comparisons with 2021):
•record consolidated total revenues of $6.16 billion compared with $5.41 billion, an increase of 13.8%
•record consolidated gross profit of $1.42 billion compared with $1.35 billion, an increase of 5.6%; 2021 consolidated gross profit was burdened by $30.6 million of costs related to the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting
•consolidated selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses representing 6.4% of total revenues
•net earnings from continuing operations attributable to martin marietta of $856.3 million compared with $702.0 million, an increase of 22.0%
•record consolidated adjusted ebitda from continuing operations of $1.60 billion, an increase of 4.7%
•operating cash flow of $991.2 million, a decrease of 12.9%
continued disciplined execution against capital allocation priorities:
•optimized portfolio with divestitures of the company's colorado and central texas ready mixed concrete businesses and certain west coast cement and ready mixed concrete operations
•capital investments into operations of $481.8 million
•quarterly dividend increase of 8% in august 2022, resulting in total annual dividends paid of $159.1 million, or $2.54 per share
•repurchase of 0.4 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $150.0 million business environment building materials business the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace. the business' profitability is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending, which are affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, geographic, employment and population dynamics.
the heavy-side construction business, inclusive of much of the company's operations, is conducted outdoors. therefore, erratic weather patterns, precipitation and other weather-related conditions, including flooding, hurricanes, cold temperatures, earthquakes, droughts and wildfires, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability. generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are most subject to the impacts of winter weather, while the second and third quarters can be subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation. the impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the building materials business' key considerations section.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product lines aggregates are an engineered, granular material consisting of crushed stone, sand and gravel, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications. the company's operations consist mostly of open pit quarries; however, the company is also the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states, with 14 active underground mines located in the east group. the company's aggregates reserves average approximately 75 years at the 2022 annual production level.
cement is the basic agent used to bind coarse aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete. the company has a strategic and leading cement position in the state of texas, with production facilities in midlothian, texas, south of dallas/fort worth, and hunter, texas, centrally located along i-35 between san antonio and austin. these two facilities produce portland limestone and specialty cements, have a combined annual capacity of approximately 4.5 million tons and collectively operated at approximately 77% utilization for clinker production in 2022; clinker is the initial product of cement production. the midlothian plant has a permit that allows for annual capacity expansion of 0.8 million tons. the company is currently undertaking a finishing capacity expansion project at the midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed in the middle of 2024 and will provide 0.5 million tons of incremental annual capacity. further, the company is nearing completion of converting its plants to manufacture a less carbon-intensive portland limestone cement, known as type 1l, that has been approved by the texas department of transportation. in addition to the two production facilities, the company operates several cement distribution terminals.
calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement. the company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants in texas. during 2021, the company purchased two cement plants in redding and tehachapi, california, and related distribution facilities as part of the acquisition of lehigh hanson, inc.'s west region business (lehigh west region). the redding plant and related distribution terminals were sold on june 30, 2022. the tehachapi plant and related distribution terminals were classified as assets held for sale and discontinued operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. in august 2022, the company announced a definitive agreement to sell the tehachapi plant and related distribution terminals, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
ready mixed concrete is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers' construction projects and then typically transported by mixer trucks and poured at the project site. the coarse aggregates used for ready mixed concrete are a washed material with limited amounts of fines (i.e., dirt and clay). the company operates ready mixed concrete plants in arizona, california and texas. the california ready mixed concrete operations were classified as assets held for sale and discontinued operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. the company's asphalt operations are located in arizona, california, colorado and minnesota and paving services are offered in california and colorado. market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with the company's upstream product lines of aggregates and cement.
end-use trends
•according to the latest available data published by the u.s. geological survey, for the nine months ended september 30, 2022, estimated construction aggregates consumption increased 3.0% compared with the nine months ended september 30, 2021, and for the eleven months ended november 30, 2022, cement consumption increased 4.4% versus the comparable prior-year period.
•national not seasonally adjusted construction spending statistics for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 versus the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, according to u.s. census bureau, reveal:
- total value of construction put in place increased 10%
- public construction spending increased 5%
- private nonresidential construction market spending increased 9%
-  private residential construction market spending increased 13%
the principal end-use markets of the building materials business are public infrastructure (i.e., highways; streets; roads; bridges; and schools); nonresidential construction (i.e., manufacturing and distribution facilities; industrial complexes; office form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations buildings; large retailers and wholesalers; healthcare; hospitality; and energy-related activity); and residential construction (i.e., subdivision development; and single- and multi-family housing). aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast, collectively comprising the chemrock/rail market.
public infrastructure projects can require several years to complete, while residential and nonresidential construction projects are usually completed within one year. generally, customer purchase orders do not contain firm quantity commitments, regardless of end-use market. therefore, management does not utilize a company backlog in managing its business.
infrastructure the public infrastructure market accounted for 35% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2022, a 5% volume increase from 2021 as a result of solid demand spurred by accelerating federal and state level investment. the company's shipments to this end-use market remain below the most recent five-year average of 36% and ten-year average of 39%.
public construction projects, once awarded, are typically seen through to completion. thus, delays from weather or other factors can serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle. while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles, public infrastructure spending has been comparatively more stable due to the predictability of funding from federal, state and local governments. the infrastructure investments and jobs act (iij act) was signed into law on november 15, 2021 and contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects.
state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding, including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives, are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need for their expanded role in public infrastructure funding. in november 2022, 411 state and local ballot initiatives, or 87% of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote, were approved. these approved infrastructure initiatives are estimated to generate nearly $23 billion in one-time and recurring revenues, with initiatives in texas, the company's largest revenue-generating state, accounting for over $15 billion of this total.
nonresidential the nonresidential construction market accounted for 36% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2022, a 3% volume increase over 2021, reflecting several large warehouse projects. large industrial projects of scale led by energy, onshore manufacturing and data centers continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential shipments. over the medium term, the company expects enhanced federal investment from the inflation reduction act and creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors act will further support and accelerate post-pandemic secular growth trends, including restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains, electric vehicle transition and continued adoption of digital and cloud-based technologies, resulting in robust demand within the heavy nonresidential sector. the dodge momentum index, a twelve-month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by dodge construction network, was 222.2 in december 2022, where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100. this represented an increase of 40% from december 2021, further suggesting positive momentum in the nonresidential construction sector at the onset of 2023.
residential the residential construction market accounted for 24% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2022 and was flat compared with strong 2021 activity. this end use typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles. the company's exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions (including streets, sidewalks, utilities and storm and sewage drainage), single-family homes and multi-family units. construction of both subdivisions and single-family homes is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than construction of multi-family units. therefore, the level of new subdivision starts, as well as new single-family housing permits, is a strong leading indicator of residential volumes. for the year ended december 31, 2022, not seasonally adjusted national housing starts decreased 3% to 1.55 million units compared with 2021 and not seasonally adjusted national housing permits decreased 5% versus 2021. despite overall underbuilt conditions, several of the company's markets experienced a slowdown in single-family demand due to affordability concerns, increased interest rates and logistical challenges.
chemrock/rail the remaining 5% of the company's 2022 aggregates shipments was to the chemrock/rail market, which includes ballast and agricultural limestone. ballast is an aggregates product used to stabilize railroad track beds. agricultural lime, a high-calcium form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations carbonate material, is used as a supplement in animal feed, a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer. additionally, chemrock/rail includes rip rap, which is used as a stabilizing material to control erosion caused by water runoff at embankments, ocean beaches, inlets, rivers and streams, and high-calcium limestone, which is used as filler in glass, plastic, paint, rubber, adhesives, grease and paper. chemical-grade, high-calcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants.
pricing trends materials pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreed-upon price during a definitive period. since infrastructure projects span multiple years, announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the company sells products under existing price agreements. pricing escalators included in multi-year infrastructure contracts serve to somewhat mitigate this effect. however, during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs, multi-year infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth. additionally, the company may implement multiple price increases throughout the year, on a market-by-market basis, where appropriate, as was done in 2022. pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market. for further information on pricing, see the discussion in the financial overview section.
cost structure costs of revenues for the building materials business are components of costs incurred at the quarries, mines, cement plants, ready mixed concrete plants, asphalt plants, paving operations and distribution yards and facilities. cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials, freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility and production overhead costs.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally, the significant components of costs of revenues for the aggregates product line are (1) labor and related benefits; (2) internal freight; (3) depreciation, depletion and amortization; (4) repairs and maintenance; (5) energy; (6) supplies; and (7) contract services. in 2022, these categories represented 82% of the aggregates product line's total costs of revenues.
variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume, while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume. production is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs, as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours. further, components of energy, supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes. accordingly, the company's operating leverage can be substantial.
generally, when the company invests capital in facilities and equipment, increased capacity and productivity reduce labor and repair costs, and can offset increased fixed depreciation costs. however, the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lower-demand environment, resulting in under-absorption of fixed costs.
wage and benefit inflation and other increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy. further, workforce reductions resulting from process automation and mobile fleet right-sizing, primarily in the aggregates operations, have mitigated rising labor costs. during economic downturns, the company reviews its operations and, where practical, temporarily idles certain sites. the company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close proximity. in certain markets, management can create production "super crews" that work on a rotating basis at various locations. for example, within a market, a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry. this has allowed the company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand.
cement production is a capital-intensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate continuously with the exception of maintenance shutdowns. kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made. in 2022 and 2021, the cement operations incurred outage costs of $33.3 million and $23.6 million, respectively. the increase in outage costs in 2022 compared with 2021 is primarily attributable to the timing of planned and unplanned kiln outages. the company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns.
the production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt requires the use of cement and liquid asphalt raw materials, respectively. therefore, fluctuations in availability and prices for these raw materials directly affect the company's operating results.
typically, diesel fuel represents the single-largest component of energy costs for the building materials business. the average cost per gallon was $4.01 and $2.36 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. further, the company's contracts of affreightment for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations building materials business' key considerations growth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a long-haul distribution network the u.s. department of the interior identified possible sources of indigenous rock and documented its limited supply in certain areas of the united states, including the coastal areas from virginia to texas. further, certain interior united states markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning, permitting and/or environmental laws and regulations. the company's long-haul distribution network is used to supplement, or in many cases, wholly supply, the local crushed stone needs of these areas.
the long-haul distribution network can also diversify market risk for locations that engage in long-haul transportation of aggregates products. this is particularly true where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail, water and/or truck to be sold in other markets. the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location.
product shipments are moved by rail, water and truck through the company's long-haul distribution network. the company's rail network primarily serves its texas, florida, colorado and gulf coast markets, while the company's bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships. the company's strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material. at december 31, 2022, the distribution network available to the company consisted of 78 aggregates yards and 11 cement terminals, of which six cement terminals were classified as discontinued operations.
the company's increased rail shipments have made it more reliant on railroad operations, including track congestion, crew and locomotive availability, the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts. further, changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the company's rail network.
a portion of railcars and all ships of the company's long-haul distribution network are under short- and long-term leases, some with purchase options, and contracts of affreightment. the limited availability of water and rail transportation providers, coupled with limited distribution sites, can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rates.
the company has long-term agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports. these contracts of affreightment are take-or-pay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements. the minimum requirements were met in 2022. the company's waterborne contracts of affreightment have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. however, there can be no assurance that such contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and deep-water ships provide the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the southwest and southeast coastal markets.
public infrastructure, historically, the company's largest end-use market, is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources transportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and creating jobs, which are priorities of many of the government's economic plans. public-sector construction related to transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources. the federal highway bill, currently the iij act, provides annual funding for public-sector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations, which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs. the federal government's surface transportation programs are funded mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund, which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account. revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax, a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts' accumulated balances. of the currently imposed federal gas tax of $0.184 per gallon, which has been static since 1993, $0.15 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund.
since most states are required to balance their budgets, reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states' expenditures. however, the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources, such as highway user fees, or whether portions are paid for with general funds.
in addition to federal appropriations, each state typically funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees, typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees. over the past several years, states have assumed a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment, including initiating special-purpose taxes and raising gas taxes. management believes that financing at the state and local levels, such as bond issuances, toll roads, vehicle miles traveled fees and tax initiatives, will continue to grow and have a fundamental role in advancing infrastructure projects. state infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company. the level of state public-works spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies, and the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state. the state economies of the building materials business' ten largest revenue-generating states may disproportionately affect the company's financial performance.
governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private-sector spending. obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states. before a state or local department of transportation can solicit bids on an eligible construction project, it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost. federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress.
the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding. a large number of roads, highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 now require major repair or reconstruction. according to the latest information available from the road information program (trip), a national transportation research group, vehicle travel on the nation's roads increased 26% from 2000 to 2019, while new lane road mileage increased only 9% over the same period. trip also reports that 40% of the nation's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, while 7% of the nation's bridges are in poor/structurally deficient condition. additionally, there is an estimated backlog of $123 billion of improvements to the nation's highway system that requires an increase in annual investment of $23 billion to $57 billion for the next 20 years to address these improvements and meet mobility and modernization needs. management believes infrastructure activity for 2023 and beyond should benefit from the iij act and additional state and local infrastructure initiatives.
in addition to highways and bridges, transportation infrastructure includes aviation, mass transit, and ports and waterways. railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth, which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements.
erratic weather can significantly impact operations production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather, seasonal changes and other climate-related conditions. typically, due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months, the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity. as such, temperatures in the months of march and november can meaningfully affect form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company's first- and fourth-quarter results, respectively, where warm and/or moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively.
excessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company. in particular, the company's operations in the southeastern and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity from june 1 through november 1, but most notably in august, september and october. the company's california operations are at risk for wildfire activity and water use restrictions in severe drought conditions. increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events have been linked to climate change, and further global warming may increase the risk of adverse weather conditions.
capital investment decisions driven by capital intensity of the building materials business and focus on land the company's organic capital program is designed to leverage construction market growth through investment in both permanent and portable facilities at the company's operations. over an economic cycle, the company typically invests organic capital at an annual level that approximates depreciation expense. at mid-cycle and through cyclical peaks, organic capital investment typically exceeds depreciation expense, as the company supports current capacity needs and future growth. conversely, at a cyclical trough, the company may reduce levels of capital investment. regardless of cycle, the company sets a priority of investing capital to ensure safe, environmentally-sound and efficient operations, as well as to provide the highest quality of customer service and establish a foundation for future growth.
the company is diligent in its focus on land opportunities, including potential new sites (greensites) and existing site expansion. land purchases are usually opportunistic and can include contiguous property around existing quarry locations. such property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserves, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. in either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry typically allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and an extension of quarry life.
magnesia specialties business the magnesia specialties business manufactures magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee, michigan facility. the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville, ohio facility. of 2022 total magnesia specialties revenues, 72% was attributable to chemicals products, 27% was attributable to lime and 1% was attributable to stone.
in 2022, 74% of lime shipments was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 26% was used internally as a raw material for the manufacturing of chemicals products. dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are primarily used by the domestic steel industry and, overall, 31% of magnesia specialties' 2022 total revenues was related to products used in the steel industry. accordingly, a portion of the segment's revenues and profits is affected by production and inventory trends within the steel industry, which are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors. domestic steel production averaged 81% of capacity in 2021, but declined in 2022, averaging 75%. the form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization. the chemical products business focuses on higher-margin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volumes that support efficient operations.
total revenues of the magnesia specialties business were predominantly derived from domestic customers in 2022. financial results can be affected by foreign currency exchange rates, increasing transportation costs or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. to mitigate the short-term effect of currency exchange rates, foreign transactions are denominated in united states dollars.
a significant portion of the magnesia specialties business' costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature. the production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke; therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results. to help mitigate this risk, the company has fixed-price agreements for approximately 39% of its 2023 energy needs for coal and natural gas. for 2022, the segment's average cost per mmbtu (1,000,000 british thermal units) of natural gas increased 47% versus 2021. given high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment's results of operations. management expects future organic profitability growth to result from increased pricing, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further cost reductions.
the magnesia specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation, particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from woodville to manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both woodville and manistee. the segment can be affected by the risks mentioned in the long-haul distribution discussion in the building materials business' key considerations section.
environmental regulation and litigation the expansion and growth of the aggregates industry is subject to increasing challenges from environmental and political advocates aiming to control the pace and direction of future development. certain environmental groups have published lists of targeted municipal areas, including areas within the company's marketplace, for environmental and suburban growth control. the effect of these initiatives on the company's growth is typically localized. further challenges are expected as the momentum of these initiatives ebb and flow across the united states. rail and other transportation alternatives are being heralded by these special-interest groups as solutions to mitigate road traffic congestion and overcrowding.
the company's operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. certain of the company's operations may occasionally use substances classified as toxic or hazardous. the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company's businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the company's operations; such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. new permits are generally required for opening new sites or for expansion at existing operations and can take several years to obtain. moreover, land use, rezoning and special or conditional use permits are increasingly difficult to obtain. once a permit is issued, the location is required to generally operate in accordance with the approved site plan.
the clean air act, originally passed in 1963 and periodically updated by amendments, is the united states' national air pollution control program that granted the environmental protection agency (epa) authority to set limits on the level of various air pollutants. to be in compliance with national ambient air quality standards, a defined geographic area must be below established limits for six pollutants. environmental groups have been successful in lawsuits against the federal and certain state departments of transportation, delaying highway construction in municipal areas not in compliance with the clean air act. the epa designates geographic areas as nonattainment areas when the level of air pollutants exceeds the national standard. nonattainment areas receive deadlines to reduce air pollutants by instituting various control strategies or otherwise face fines or control by the epa. included as nonattainment areas are several major metropolitan areas in the company's markets, such as houston/brazoria/galveston, texas; dallas/fort worth, texas; bexar county in san antonio/new braunfels, texas; denver, colorado; boulder, colorado; fort collins/greeley/loveland, colorado; atlanta, georgia; baltimore, maryland; los angeles-san bernardino counties, california; los angeles - south coast basin, california; phoenix/mesa, arizona; san diego county, california; san francisco bay area, california; san joaquin valley, california; and sacramento county, california. federal transportation funding has been directly tied to compliance with the clean air act.
large emitters (facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year) of greenhouse gases (ghg) must report ghg generation to comply with the epa's mandatory greenhouse gases reporting rule (ghg rule). the company files annual reports in accordance with the ghg rule relating to operations at its three cement plants in texas and california, as well as its magnesia specialties facilities in woodville, ohio, and manistee, michigan, each of which emit certain ghg, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. if congress passes additional legislation limiting ghg emissions, these operations will likely be subject to such legislation. the company believes that any increased operating costs or taxes related to ghg emission limitations at its cement or woodville operations would be passed on to its customers. the manistee facility may have to absorb extra costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to maintain competitive pricing in its markets. the company cannot reasonably predict how much those increased costs may be.
the company is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. in the opinion of management, based upon currently available facts, the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation or other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters, relating to the company and its subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the company's operations, cash flows or financial position.
financial overview in 2022, the company achieved its eleventh consecutive year of growth for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted ebitda. this section presents metrics for continuing operations.
results of operations the discussion and analysis that follow reflect management's assessment of the financial condition and results of operations (md&a) of the company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements. as discussed in more detail, the company's operating results are highly dependent upon activity within the construction marketplace, economic cycles within the public and private business sectors, and seasonal and other weather-related conditions. accordingly, financial results for any year presented, or year-to-year comparisons of reported results, may not be indicative of future operating results. as permitted by the securities and exchange commission (sec) under the fast act modernization and simplification of regulation s-k, the company has elected to omit the discussion of the earliest period (2020) presented as it was included in its md&a in its 2021 form 10-k filed on february 22, 2022, incorporated by reference from item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" thereto.
the company's building materials business generated the majority of consolidated total revenues and earnings from continuing operations. the following comparative analysis and discussion should be read within this context. further, sensitivity analysis and certain other data are provided to enhance the reader's understanding of md&a and are not intended to be indicative of management's judgment of materiality.

income tax expense variances in the estimated effective income tax rates, when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate, are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves, the effect of state income taxes, stock compensation deductions, and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized. additionally, certain acquisition-related expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes.
the permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate. the statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations. due to these limitations, changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate. however, the impact of the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings.
the company's estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was 21.5% and 17.9%, respectively. the higher 2022 effective income tax rate versus 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture of the colorado and central texas ready mixed concrete businesses.

impairment review of goodwill goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment. an interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the company performs its impairment evaluation as of october 1, which represents the annual evaluation date. the impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 24% (excluding goodwill allocated to assets held for sale) of the company's total assets at december 31, 2022; the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions; and an impairment charge could be material to the company's financial condition and results of operations.
certain operating segments within the building materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting. the company's reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the building materials business. goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. if subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit, a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit. the southwest division is the most significant reporting unit and includes $1.8 billion of the company's goodwill. there is also $1.1 billion of goodwill in the west division reporting unit. there is no goodwill related to the magnesia specialties business.
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value, which represents a step-1 analysis. however, prior to step 1, the company may perform an optional qualitative assessment, or step 0. as part of the qualitative assessment, the company considers, among other things, the following events and circumstances: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events. if the company concludes it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit's fair value is higher than its carrying value, the company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. otherwise, it proceeds to step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis. if the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further calculation is necessary. a reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a step-1 failure and results in an impairment charge. when the company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value, it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period. the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in step 1. the company performs a step-1 analysis for all its reporting units every three years.
for the 2022 annual impairment evaluation, the company performed a step-1 analysis for all reporting units. the fair values were calculated using a discounted cash flow model. key assumptions included management's estimates of changes in average selling price, shipment volumes and production costs as well as assumptions of future profitability, capital requirements, discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 10.25% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value. for sensitivity purposes, a 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant, would still result in all units passing the step-1 analysis.
future profitability and capital requirements are, by their nature, estimates. price, cost and volume assumptions were based on various factors, including historical averages and current forecasts, external sources, and market conditions, while also considering any production capacity constraints. capital requirements included maintenance-level needs and known efficiency- and capacity-increasing investments.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a discount rate is calculated for each reporting unit that requires a step-1 analysis and represents its weighted average cost of capital. the calculation of the discount rate includes the following components, which are primarily based on published sources: equity risk premium, historical beta, risk-free interest rate, small-stock premium and borrowing rate.
the terminal growth rate was based on anticipated average gdp increases post-2023.
management believes that all assumptions used were reasonable based on historical operating results and expected future trends. however, if future operating results are unfavorable as compared with forecasts, the results of future goodwill impairment evaluations could be negatively affected. further, mineral reserves, which represent underlying assets producing the reporting units' cash flows for the aggregates product line, are depleting assets by their nature. any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the company.
pension benefit obligation and pension expense - selection of assumptions the company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a supplemental excess retirement plan (serp) for certain retirees (see note k to the consolidated financial statements). annually, as of december 31, management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting expected future pay increases through the participants' expected retirement dates. a discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation.
annual pension expense, referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements, (inclusive of serp expense) consists of several components:
•service cost, which represents the present value of benefits attributed to services rendered in the current year, measured by expected future salary levels to assumed retirement dates;
•interest cost, which represents one year's additional interest on the projected benefit obligation;
•expected return on assets, which represents the expected investment return on pension plan assets; and
•amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses, which represents components that are recognized over time rather than immediately. prior service cost represents credit given to employees for years of service already accrued. at december 31, 2022, unrecognized prior service cost was $48.2 million. management currently expects to amortize $5.9 million of the unrecognized prior service cost in 2023. actuarial gains and losses arise from changes in assumptions regarding future events, a change in the benefit obligation resulting from experience different from assumed or when actual returns on pension assets differ from expected returns. at december 31, 2022, the unrecognized actuarial loss was $43.2 million. pension accounting rules currently allow companies to amortize the portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss that represents more than 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets, using the average remaining service life for the amortization period. the calculation is performed on a plan-by-plan basis. management currently expects to amortize $0.4 million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in 2023.
the aforementioned components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense.
management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions. the key assumptions are as follows:
•the discount rate is used to present value the projected benefit obligation and represents the current rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
•the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is used to estimate future asset returns and should reflect the average rate of long-term earnings on assets invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation.
•the mortality table and mortality improvement scale represent published statistics on the expected lives of people.
•the rate of increase in future compensation levels is used to project the pay-related pension benefit formula and should estimate actual future compensation levels.
management's selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations. the company selected a hypothetical portfolio of moody's aa bonds, with maturities that match the benefit obligations, to determine the discount rate. at december 31, 2022, the company selected a discount rate assumption of 5.88%, a 265-basis-point increase compared with the december 31, 2021 assumption. of the four key assumptions, the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense and the projected benefit obligation.
management's selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels, which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases, is generally based on the company's historical increases in pensionable earnings, while giving consideration to any future expectations. a higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation. the assumed long-term rate of increase is 4.50%.
management's selection of the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a building-block approach, whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets. based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses, the company selected an expected return on assets of 6.75%, the same as the prior-year rate. the following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets:
(in millions)   expected return on pension assets   actual return on pension assets
2022                               $77.3   ($171.4)
2021                               $70.5   $121.7
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses, which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the society of actuaries' pri-2012 base mortality table. the no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table was used for hourly participants, both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the company's participants. the company selected the mp-2020 scale for mortality improvement at december 31, 2022 and 2021.
assumptions are selected on december 31 to calculate the succeeding year's expense. the assumptions selected at december 31, 2022 were as follows:
discount rate                                            5.88%
rate of increase in future compensation levels           4.50%
expected long-term rate of return on assets              6.75%
average remaining service period for participants   10.2 years mortality tables:

mortality improvement scale                            mp-2020
using these assumptions, pension benefit obligation as of december 31, 2022 was $857.6 million and 2023 pension expense is expected to be approximately $16.6 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans. changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense:
•a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would have changed the december 31, 2022 pension benefit obligation by approximately $25.2 million.
•a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would change the 2023 expected expense by approximately $0.9 million.
•a 25-basis-point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would change the 2023 expected expense by approximately $2.6 million.
the company made pension plan and serp contributions of $90.2 million in 2022 and $482.6 million during the five-year period ended december 31, 2022. in total, the company's pension plans are overfunded (fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation) by $209.5 million at december 31, 2022. the company's projected benefit obligation was $857.6 million at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $277.8 million, or 24%, versus the prior year. this decrease was driven by an increased actuarial gain primarily attributable to a higher discount rate compared with the prior year. the company expects to make pension plan and serp contributions of $36.5 million in 2023, of which $25.0 million is voluntary.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations estimated effective income tax rate the company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes. accordingly, the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes, estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management's judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and accruals for uncertain tax positions. the result is management's estimate of the annual effective tax rate (the etr).
income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the united states internal revenue code and the statutes of various foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions in which the company conducts business. changes in the statutory tax rates and/or tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material impact on the etr. the effect of these changes, if material, is recognized when the change is enacted.
as prescribed by these tax regulations, as well as generally accepted accounting principles, the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same. therefore, these differences between the company's pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent, depending on their nature.
temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period. an example of a temporary difference is the use of the straight-line method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes. temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities (i.e., future tax deductions or future taxable income). therefore, when temporary differences occur, they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account. as such, total income tax expense as reported in the company's consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences.
the company has deferred tax liabilities, primarily for right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to property, plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line and units-of-production methods used for financial reporting purposes. these temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes. this temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes, either through divestitures or an impairment charge. the timing of such events cannot be estimated. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards. the reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the company's contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes. the temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture.
the company has deferred tax assets, primarily for inventories, unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans, lease liabilities, valuation reserves, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. the deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes. the reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances, including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes. the deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stock-based compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period. for income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. the company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles, increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period.
business combinations - allocation of purchase price the company's board of directors and management regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase the company's market presence and/or are form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related to the company's existing markets. when an acquisition is completed, the company's consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date control is obtained. the purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition. the company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. further, the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination.
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and, therefore, represents an exit price. fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date. the company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:
•level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
•level 2 - observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
•level 3 - unobservable inputs, used to value the asset or liability which includes the use of valuation models level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded long-term debt.
level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables, inventories, machinery and equipment, land, buildings, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accruals for payables, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations, and contingencies. additionally, level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.
level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products, and separately-identifiable intangible assets. the fair values of mineral reserves and mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires significant judgment to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation and contributory asset charges. the estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. significant assumptions used to estimate future cash flows include changes in forecasted revenues based on sales price and shipment volumes as well as forecasted expenses inclusive of production costs and capital needs. the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.
the company values separately-identifiable acquired intangible assets which may include, but are not limited to, permits, customer relationships, water rights and noncompetition agreements. the fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or, in the case of water rights, a market approach.
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings. the selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the company subsequent to the business combination.
the company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date. any such adjustments are based on the company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. measurement-period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. the measurement period ends once the company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property, plant and equipment net property, plant and equipment (excluding the amount allocated to assets held for sale) represented 42% of total assets at december 31, 2022. accordingly, accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy. useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. historically, the company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.
aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant, property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. the company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see environmental regulation and litigation section). the depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. if the company's analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves.
well-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. this subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling. the company's objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use. the number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering. a typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres, but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous.
despite previous drilling and sampling, once accessed, the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material. if a flaw in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse effect on the company's ability to serve certain customers or on the company's profitability. in addition, other issues can arise that limit the company's ability to access reserves in a particular quarry, including geological occurrences, blasting practices and zoning issues.
locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method, whereby a six-inch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled. deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. additionally, the quality and sand-to-gravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically. hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling.
the geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the company. further, the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit, based on u.s. geological maps, also dictates the number of holes drilled.
the generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows:
proven reserves - these reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in u.s. geologic maps, the u.s. department of agriculture soil maps, aerial photographs and/or electromagnetic, seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms. the proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps, safety benches, pillars (underground) and the fines (small particles) that will be generated during processing. proven reserves form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas, as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines. the company typically assumes a loss factor of 25%. however, the assumed loss factor at coastal operations is approximately 40% due to the nature of the material. the assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35% primarily due to pillars.
probable reserves - these reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties.
the company's proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and also include reserves at the company's inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. the company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see environmental regulation and litigation section).
mineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.
the company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. for 2022, depletion expense was $59.8 million.
the company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.
new mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. when this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. if the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs.

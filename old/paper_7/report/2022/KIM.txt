item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10-k. historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations.
the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification. the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. the company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. accordingly, the company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes.  in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  the company is required to make subjective assessments, of which, the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, and valuation of joint venture investments and other investments.  the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments.  application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
trade accounts receivable the company reviews its trade accounts receivable, related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues for collectability. the company evaluates the probability of the collection of the lessee's total accounts receivable, including the corresponding straight-line rent receivable balance on a lease-by-lease basis. determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during a lease term requires significant judgment. the company's analysis of its accounts receivable included (i) customer credit worthiness, (ii) assessment of risk associated with the tenant, and (iii) current economic trends.  in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. the company includes provision for doubtful accounts in revenues from rental properties, net.  if a lessee's accounts receivable balance is considered uncollectible, the company will write-off the receivable balances associated with the lease and will only recognize lease income on a cash basis. in addition to the lease-specific collectability assessment, the analysis also recognizes a general reserve, as a reduction to revenues from rental properties, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the company's historical and current collection experience and the potential for settlement of arrears. although the company estimates uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against revenues from rental properties, actual results may differ from those estimates. for example, in the event that the company's collectability determinations are not accurate, and we are required to write off additional receivables equaling 1% of the outstanding accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2022, the company's rental income and net income would decrease by $3.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. if the company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect the remaining lessee's lease payments under the lease term, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) are reinstated with a corresponding increase to rental income.
real estate valuation of real estate, and intangible assets and liabilities the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
transaction costs related to acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be business combinations are expensed as incurred. also, upon acquisition of real estate operating properties in either an asset acquisition or business combination, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
26
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements (in years)                                                 5 to 50

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)   terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
during 2022, the company acquired properties for a total purchase price of $524.9 million. $8.4 million, or less than 1.6% of the total purchase price, was allocated to above-market leases and $24.1 million, or 4.6% was allocated to below-market leases. if the amounts allocated in 2022 to above-market and below-market leases were each reduced by 1% of the total purchase price, the net annual market lease amortization through rental income would decrease by $0.9 million (using the weighted average life of above-market and below-market leases at each respective acquired property).
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, general market conditions and delays of development, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows, net of anticipated construction and leasing costs (undiscounted and unleveraged), of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor, operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. the company's estimated fair values are primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third parties, discounted cash flow models or third-party appraisals. estimated fair values that are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnote 3, 4 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
valuation of joint venture investments and other investments on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period, capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
see footnote 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's accounting policies and estimates.

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. there remains significant uncertainty in the current macro-economic environment, driven by inflationary pressures, as well as ongoing supply chain issues. these factors have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, consumer discretionary spending and many of our tenants. the convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to impact the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. to better position itself, the company's strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters and service-oriented tenants, which offer buy online and pick up in store, off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.
the company's portfolio is focused on first ring suburbs around major metropolitan-area u.s. markets, predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sun belt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry. the company owns a predominantly grocery-anchored portfolio clustered in the nation's top markets. the company believes it can continue to increase its occupancy levels, rental rates and overall rental growth. in addition, the company, on a selective basis, has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixed-use components.
as part of the company's investment strategy, each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. in addition, the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate, such as, repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. the company may continue to dispose of certain properties. if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values, the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material. for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see item 1a. risk factors.

the change in (loss)/gain on marketable securities, net of $820.7 million is primarily the result of mark-to-market fluctuations of the shares of aci common stock held by the company.
interest expense -
the increase in interest expense of $22.7 million is primarily due to (i) increased levels of borrowings resulting from the assumption of senior unsecured notes and mortgages in connection with the merger and public debt offerings, partially offset by (ii) the repayment of senior unsecured notes and mortgages during 2022 and 2021 and (iii) an increase in fair market value amortization, primarily related to the assumption of debt in connection with the merger and acceleration due to the repayment of senior unsecured notes in 2022.

on january 17, 2023, the supreme court of the state of washington denied a motion by the attorney general of the state of washington to hear an appeal from the superior court's denial to enjoin aci from paying the special dividend. as a result of the decision by the supreme court of the state of washington, the temporary restraining order preventing payment of the special dividend was lifted. on january 20, 2023, aci distributed the special dividend to holders of record as of october 24, 2022. the company received its share of the special dividend payment of $194.1 million during january 2023, and will recognize this income during the three months ending march 31, 2023.

dividends -
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as it monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio which reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate. cash dividends paid were $544.7 million, $382.1 million and $379.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
although the company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. the company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the company's reit taxable income distribution requirements. on october 25, 2022, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l and m) which were paid on january 17, 2023, to shareholders of record on december 30, 2022. in addition, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, which was paid on december 23, 2022, to shareholders of record on december 9, 2022.
on february 8, 2023, the company's board of directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (classes l and m), which are scheduled to be paid on april 17, 2023, to shareholders of record on april 3, 2023. additionally, on february 8, 2023, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share payable on march 23, 2023 to shareholders of record on march 9, 2023.
contractual obligations and other commitments contractual obligations the company has debt obligations relating to its credit facility (no outstanding balance as of december 31, 2022), unsecured senior notes and mortgages with maturities ranging from four months to 27 years. as of december 31, 2022, the company's consolidated total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of 9.5 years. in addition, the company has non-cancelable leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. as of december 31, 2022, the company had 40 consolidated shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land or a portion of the underlying land to the company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. amounts due in 2023 in connection with these leases aggregate $12.4 million. the following table summarizes the company's consolidated debt maturities (excluding extension options, unamortized debt issuance costs of $68.1 million and fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $43.7 million) and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of december 31, 2022:

the company has $12.0 million of consolidated secured debt scheduled to mature in 2023. the company anticipates satisfying the remaining future maturities with operating cash flows or debt refinancing.
commitments the company has issued letters of credit in connection with the completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the company's insurance program. at december 31, 2022, these letters of credit aggregated $43.3 million.
38
the company has investments with funding commitments of $30.4 million, of which $16.5 million has been funded as of december 31, 2022.
in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2022, the company had $18.4 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
the company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on series a bonds issued by the sheridan redevelopment agency which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a property owned by the company in sheridan, colorado. these tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $45.5 million outstanding at december 31, 2022. the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("pif") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. the revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and pif have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. as of december 31, 2022, the company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
debt balances within the company's unconsolidated joint venture investments for which the company held noncontrolling ownership interests at december 31, 2022, aggregated $1.4 billion. as of december 31, 2022, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from three months to 8.5 years and bore interest at rates ranging from 2.95% to libor plus 200 basis points (6.39% as of december 31, 2022). approximately $38.1 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2023. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales of properties within the ventures, and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other investments the company has provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties and loans through its preferred equity program. as of december 31, 2022, the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $69.4 million relating to 12 properties as of december 31, 2022, these preferred equity investment properties had non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $232.8 million. these loans have scheduled maturities ranging from less than one year to 1.5 years and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to sofr plus 265 basis points (6.78% as of december 31, 2022). due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.
effects of inflation many of the company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. to assist in partially mitigating the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation the company's leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

funds from operations ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. nareit defines ffo as net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. the company also made an election, per the nareit funds from operations white paper-2018 restatement, to exclude from its calculation of ffo (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. as such, the company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables or gains/impairments on other investments in nareit defined ffo.
the company presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo available to the company's common shareholders when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and, therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

(3)   includes merger charges of $50.2 million recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021, in connection with the merger. in addition, the three months and year ended december 31, 2021, includes a pension valuation adjustment of $3.0 million of income included in other income, net on the company's consolidated statements of income. includes early extinguishment of debt charges of $7.7 million recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022.

same property net operating income same property noi is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. it excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.

for the three months and years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company included same property noi from the weingarten properties acquired through the merger. the amount included in the table below, for "weingarten same property noi", for the year ended december 31, 2021, represents the same property noi from weingarten properties prior to the merger, which is not included in the company's net (loss)/income available to the company's common shareholders.
same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, tifs and amortization of above/below-market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company's proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. the company's method of calculating same property noi available to the company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

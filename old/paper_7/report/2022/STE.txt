item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•what factors affect our business;
•what our earnings and costs were;
•why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•where our earnings came from;
•how this affects our overall financial condition;
•what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•where cash is expected to come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business," part i, item 1a, "risk factors," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."
revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our applied sterilization technologies segment.
•capital equipment revenues - we define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes: steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated or.
•consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables including v-pro, system 1 and 1e consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, cleaning consumables, dental and surgical instruments.
•recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary steris is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. we help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, endoscopy accessories, barrier products, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room ("or") integration.
we operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: healthcare, applied sterilization technologies, life sciences and dental. non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "business segment information."
the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
acquisitions. during fiscal 2023, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions which expanded our product and service offerings in the applied sterilization technologies and healthcare segments. total aggregate consideration was approximately $49.8 million, including potential contingent consideration of $7.3 million.
on june 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in cantel medical llc ("cantel") through a u.s. subsidiary. cantel, formerly headquartered in little falls, new jersey, with approximately 3,700 employees, is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental customers. the total consideration for cantel common stock and stock equivalents was $3.6 billion.
we believe that the acquisition will strengthen steris's leadership in infection prevention by bringing together two complementary businesses able to offer a broader set of customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention, endoscopy and sterilization products and services. cantel's dental business extended our business into a new customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes. this business is reported as the dental segment. the rest of cantel was integrated into our existing healthcare and life sciences segments. additionally, the acquisition is expected to result in cost savings from optimizing global back-office infrastructure, leveraging best-demonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs.
the results of cantel are only reflected in the results of operations and cash flows from june 2, 2021 forward, which will affect results of comparability to the prior period operations and cash flows.
in addition to the acquisition of cantel, we completed three other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2022, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the healthcare segment. total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $3.1 million, net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of $0.1 million.
divestitures. in april 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain assets of our animal health business to veterinary orthopedic implants, llc. we recorded net proceeds of $5.2 million and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $4.9 million in the selling, general, and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of income. the business generated annual revenues of approximately $12.0 million.
in december 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell our renal care business to evoqua water technologies corp. for cash consideration of approximately $196.0 million, subject to certain potential adjustments, including a customary working capital adjustment and contingent consideration of $12.3 million. we recognized a gain on the sale of $4.9 million. the transaction closed on january 3, 2022. we acquired the renal care business as part of the cantel transaction, which closed on june 2, 2021, and had been integrated into steris's healthcare segment. the renal care business generated annual revenues of approximately $180.0 million. the proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to repay outstanding debt. during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we received an additional $1.4 million in working capital settlements related to the sale of this business.
for more information regarding our recent acquisitions and divestitures, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "business acquisitions and divestitures."
highlights.  revenues increased $372.8 million, or 8.1%, to $4,957.8 million for the year ended march 31, 2023, as compared to $4,585.1 million for the year ended march 31, 2022. these increases reflect growth in the healthcare, applied sterilization technologies, life sciences, and dental segments, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies and divestiture activities.
our gross profit percentage decreased to 43.6% for fiscal 2023 as compared to 44.0% for fiscal 2022. unfavorable impacts from inflation and productivity were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing, mix, divestiture activity and fluctuations in currency.
fiscal 2023 operating income decreased 37.0% to $268.2 million, as compared to fiscal 2022 operating income of $425.6 million. this decline was primarily due to a one time goodwill impairment charge of $490.6 million offset by a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of cantel, as well as an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
cash flows from operations were $756.9 million and free cash flow was $409.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to cash flows from operations of $684.8 million and free cash flow of $399.0 million in fiscal 2022 (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). the fiscal 2023 increase in cash flows from operations was primarily from lower costs associated with the acquisition and integration of cantel, partially offset by higher working capital, particularly inventory and accounts receivable. the increase in free cash flow was limited by increased capital spending.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 33.6% at march 31, 2023. during the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the seventeenth consecutive year to $0.47 per share per quarter.
outlook. in fiscal 2024 and beyond, we expect to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services. we anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressures in fiscal 2024. please refer to "information with respect to our business in general" in item 1."business" to this annual report on form 10-k.
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provides the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measures used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares.
the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022:

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a decreased 13.6% in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. the fiscal 2023 reduction reflects lower spending for acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to our acquisition of cantel, and a decline in incentive compensation plan expense.
goodwill impairment loss. a goodwill impairment loss of $490.6 million was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as the result of an assessment of the fair value of the dental segment made in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements. for more information regarding our goodwill impairment loss, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "goodwill and intangible assets."
research and development. research and development expenses increased $13.6 million in fiscal 2023 over fiscal 2022, primarily due to the addition of cantel and other recent acquisitions. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2023, our investments in research and development have continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.

interest expense increased $18.4 million during fiscal 2023 over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates on floating rate debt.
during fiscal 2022, we recorded fair value adjustments of $27.8 million, based on appreciation in our share price related to premium liability associated with the convertible debt assumed in the acquisition of cantel.
additional information regarding our outstanding debt and cantel convertible debt is included in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt," and in the subsection of this md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources."
interest and miscellaneous expense (income) decreased $9.1 million during fiscal 2023, as compared to 2022, primarily due to losses recognized as a result of mark to market adjustments of our equity investments. additional information regarding our mark to market adjustments of our equity investments is included in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "fair value measurements."

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 32.8% when compared to 22.8% for fiscal 2022. the fiscal 2023 effective tax rate increased when compared to 2022, primarily due to the tax impact of the goodwill impairment loss recognized on the dental segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. the fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by changes in u.s. state and local tax rates applied to existing deferred tax assets and liabilities.
business segment results of operations.
we operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: healthcare, applied sterilization technologies, life sciences and dental. non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income.
our healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. in addition, our procedural solutions also include endoscopy accessories and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas.
our applied sterilization technologies ("ast") segment is a third-party service provider for contract sterilization, as well as testing services needed to validate sterility services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. our technology-neutral offering supports customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization.
our life sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services that support pharmaceutical manufacturing, primarily for vaccine and other biopharma customers focused on aseptic manufacturing. these solutions include a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance and specialty services, and capital equipment.
our dental segment provides a comprehensive offering for dental practitioners and dental schools, offering instruments, infection prevention consumables and instrument management systems.
we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company. certain prior period costs were reallocated from the healthcare segment to corporate to conform with current year presentation. the prior period segment operating income measure has been recast for comparability.

the healthcare segment's operating income increased $56.3 million to $706.0 million in fiscal year 2023, as compared to $649.7 million in fiscal year 2022, due to higher volumes as well as the favorable impact from pricing. the segment's operating margins were 22.9% for fiscal year 2023 and 22.8% for fiscal year 2022. the increase in operating margin is primarily due to the benefits of higher volume and pricing which more than offset increased material costs.
the ast segment's operating income increased $18.9 million to $429.0 million in fiscal year 2023, as compared to $410.1 million in fiscal year 2022. the ast segment's operating margins were 46.9% for fiscal year 2023 and 48.1% for fiscal year 2022. the increase in segment operating income is primarily due to increased volume. operating margins declined as higher labor and energy costs more than offset the benefit of increased volume.
the life sciences business segment's operating income decreased $6.0 million to $210.2 million in fiscal year 2023, as compared to $216.2 million in fiscal year 2022. the segment's operating margins were 39.2% for fiscal year 2023 and 41.2% for fiscal year 2022. the decreases in segment operating income and operating margin were primarily due to a reduction in productivity as well as supply chain and inflationary cost increases partially offset by the benefits of increases in pricing and volume.
the dental business segment's operating income increased $5.1 million to $89.5 million in fiscal year 2023 as compared to $84.4 million in fiscal year 2022. the segment's operating margins were 21.2% for fiscal year 2023 and 23.3% for fiscal year 2022. the dental segment's increase in operating income is primarily due to an increase in pricing. operating margins declined as a reduction in productivity and increased supply chain and labor costs more than offset the benefit of pricing.

material future cash obligations and commercial commitments cash requirements. we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our customers' acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.

supplemental guarantor financial information steris plc ("parent") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, steris limited and steris corporation (collectively "guarantors" and each a "guarantor"), each have provided guarantees of the obligations of steris irish finco unlimited company ("finco", "steris irish finco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary issuer, under senior public notes issued by steris irish finco on april 1, 2021 and of certain other obligations relating to the senior public notes. the senior public notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. the senior public notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of steris irish finco and the guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the private placement senior notes, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the term loan and the delayed draw term loan.
all of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of steris, other than steris irish finco, steris limited and steris corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the senior public notes.
steris irish finco's main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of steris plc and its subsidiaries.
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the issuer and ability of the issuer and guarantors to service the senior public notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.
the following is a summary of these guarantees:
guarantees of senior notes
•parent company guarantor - steris plc
•subsidiary issuer - steris irish finco unlimited company
•subsidiary guarantor - steris limited
•subsidiary guarantor - steris corporation the guarantee of a guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, at such time as such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances);
•upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or the discharge of the issuer's obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture;
•as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or
•in the case of the parent, if the issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any material credit facility of the issuer terminate upon the issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the parent; and
•upon such guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer's certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with.
the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. each guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each guarantor in an amount equal to such other guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with gaap.
the following tables present summarized results of operations for the year ended march 31, 2023 and summarized balance sheet information at march 31, 2023 and 2022 for the obligor group of the senior public notes. the obligor group consists of the parent company guarantor, subsidiary issuer, and subsidiary guarantors for the senior public notes. the summarized financial information is presented after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor or issuer. transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.

credit ratings steris's senior public notes have been assigned the following credit ratings:

(1) effective may 18, 2023
each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition.  revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer. revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues. the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues. revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from customers.
we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets.
in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. at march 31, 2023, assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses.  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers. we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer's inability to pay. as a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. these analyses require judgment. if the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for credit losses.
inventories and reserves. inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost method. inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead.
we review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, we identified that the estimated fair value of the dental segment was below the carrying value and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $490.6 million. for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment charge, refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "goodwill and intangible assets."
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2023 and 2022 was $30.4 million and $26.1 million, respectively.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies."
benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.
employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2023 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

we develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2023 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $8.0 million at march 31, 2023.
we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7.5% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2023:

we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.
share-based compensation. we measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. we selected the black-scholes-merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
share-based compensation expense was $39.0 million in fiscal 2023, $57.7 million in fiscal 2022 and $26.0 million million in fiscal 2021. note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "share-based compensation," contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.

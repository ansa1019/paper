(a) effective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue is comprised of revenue from the operations of quality carriers, which was acquired by csx effective july 1, 2021.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.25
csx corporation part ii revenue total revenue increased by $2.3 billion in 2022, or 19%, when compared to the previous year primarily due to higher fuel recovery, pricing gains that include the benefit of higher export coal benchmark rates, and the inclusion of quality carriers' results.
merchandise volume chemicals - decreased due to lower shipments of crude oil and other energy-related commodities as well as waste.
agricultural and food products - increased as a result of higher shipments of ethanol, sweeteners and vegetable oils, and grain.
automotive - increased due to higher north american vehicle production as semiconductor availability has improved.
minerals - increased due to higher shipments of aggregates driven by construction demand.
forest products - decreased due to lower shipments of pulpboard and building products.
metals and equipment - decreased primarily due to lower steel shipments, partially offset by higher scrap shipments and equipment moves.
fertilizers - decreased due to declines in short-haul and long-haul phosphate shipments.
intermodal volume lower domestic shipments due to continued supply-side constraints, more subdued seasonal demand than prior year and a softening truck market were mostly offset by increased international shipments.
coal volume domestic coal decreased due to lower shipments of utility coal, including the impacts of limited coal availability during mine disruptions during the year, as well as lower steel and industrial shipments. export coal decreased due to lower shipments of thermal coal, partially driven by reduced capacity at curtis bay coal pier due to an outage at a portion of the facility. the facility is now back at full capacity.
trucking revenue trucking revenue increased $556 million versus prior year due to the inclusion of quality carriers' results and higher fuel surcharge.
other revenue other revenue was $164 million higher than prior year driven by increases in revenue for intermodal storage and equipment usage, increases in demurrage and higher affiliate revenue.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.26
csx corporation part ii expense in 2022, total expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 27%, compared to prior year. descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.
labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. these expenses increased $311 million due to the following items:
•the impacts of agreements reached with labor unions as well as inflation totaled $199 million. of the total, $32 million relates to labor and benefits in prior years.
•the inclusion of quality carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 resulted in increased costs of $74 million.
•incentive compensation costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the impact of accelerated expense for eligible employees in the prior year.
•other costs increased $67 million primarily due to hiring and retention costs, the inclusion of pan am's operations and other non-significant items.
purchased services and other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. this category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. total purchased services and other expenses increased $550 million driven by the following:
•the inclusion of quality carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 drove $280 million of additional costs.
•higher operating support costs, primarily due to inflation, higher intermodal terminal costs and an increased active locomotive fleet, drove an increase of $182 million.
•adjustments to environmental reserves resulted in $21 million higher expense.
•all other costs increased $67 million primarily due to several non-significant items including pan am's operations and acquisition-related costs.
fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. this expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. fuel expense increased $713 million primarily due to a 66% price increase in locomotive fuel prices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.
depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. depreciation expense increased $80 million primarily due to a larger net asset base, which includes quality carriers' assets, as well as the impacts of a 2022 equipment depreciation study.
equipment and other rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment. this category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. these expenses increased $32 million primarily due to increased car hire costs as well as the addition of quality carriers' costs. car hire costs increased due to higher days per load and inflation, partially offset by lower volume.
gains on property dispositions decreased to $238 million in 2022 from $454 million in 2021 primarily due to lower gains from the sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia. related to this transaction, csx recognized gains of $144 million in 2022 and $349 million in 2021.

csx corporation part ii interest expense interest expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. interest expense increased $20 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by increased capitalized interest.
other income - net other income - net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. other income increased $54 million primarily due to higher interest income, driven by increased rates, and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2022.
income tax expense income tax expense increased $78 million primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes, partially offset by favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes and favorable state legislative changes.
net earnings and earnings per diluted share net earnings increased $385 million to $4.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.27 to $1.95, due to the factors mentioned above. average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.

csx corporation part ii non-gaap measures (unaudited)
csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). csx also uses certain non-gaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation s-k item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. non-gaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap. therefore, csx's non-gaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. the presentation of these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of non-gaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below.
free cash flow management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the company's financial performance. more specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. this measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds from property dispositions. this measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. free cash flow before dividends decreased $101 million year-over-year to $3.7 billion primarily due to higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, mostly attributable to the sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia. these decreases were partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities.
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to free cash flow (non-gaap measure).

csx corporation part ii the company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the company's employees. continued capital investment in the company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.
the company remains focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. train velocity declined 10% relative to 2021. dwell increased by 6% and cars online increased 5% in 2022. compared to 2021, intermodal trip plan performance improved 3%, while carload trip plan performance decreased 7%. csx has seen an improvement in service metrics in the last quarter of 2022 and expects that trend to continue in 2023.
from a safety perspective, the fra personal injury index was flat compared to prior year while the train-accident rate improved by 1%. safety remains a top priority at csx, and the company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the company operates.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. to have a complete picture of a company's liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.
significant cash flows the following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2022 and 2021.
in 2022, the company generated $5.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was $520 million more than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income, partially offset by less favorable working capital activities. net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion, an increase in net spend of $254 million from the prior year primarily as a result of higher property additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, partially offset by decreased costs for business acquisitions. cash used in financing activities was $3.8 billion, which represents a decrease in net spend of $343 million from the prior year mostly driven by the issuance of long-term debt as well as lower repayments of debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.31
csx corporation part ii sources of cash and liquidity the company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on february 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx's discretion, subject to market conditions and csx board authorization. while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. in 2022, csx issued $2.0 billion of long-term debt. see note 10, debt and credit agreements for more information.
csx has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in march 2024. as of december 31, 2022, the company had no outstanding balances under this facility. the company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2022, the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.
uses of cash csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the company's qualified pension plan.
in 2022, csx continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. funds used for property additions are further described below.

planned capital investments for 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion. of the 2023 investment, approximately 75% is expected to be used to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. the remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. csx intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.
csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company's ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations and financial performance in the future (see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10-k).
csx 2022 form 10-k p.32
csx corporation part ii csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders. capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors. on february 14, 2023, the company's board of directors authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.11 per common share effective march 2023. management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.
material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital csx's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. further, csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. the company ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.4 billion from prior year end. the increase in total assets was primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in net properties and a $193 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies, partially offset by a reduction in cash of $281 million. the increase in net properties was primarily attributable to capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired as part of the pan am transaction. in addition, the increase in investments in affiliates and other companies includes the impact of the acquired interest in pan am southern, llc as well as higher values of several affiliates. see note 17, business combinations, for more details on purchase accounting.
total liabilities increased $2.3 billion from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and a $186 million increase in deferred taxes due to accelerated tax depreciation and the impact of the pan am acquisition. these increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $186 million. total shareholders' equity decreased $875 million from prior year end primarily driven by share repurchases of $4.7 billion and dividends paid of $852 million, partially offset by net earnings of $4.2 billion and $422 million of common stock issued to acquire pan am.
working capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. csx had a working capital surplus of $1.4 billion at december 2022 and $1.6 billion at december 2021, a decrease of $262 million. current assets decreased primarily driven by the net decline in cash of $281 million described above, partially offset by the $165 million increase in accounts receivable. current liabilities increased primarily due to the $167 million increase in accounts payable.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.33
csx corporation part ii the company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. although the company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. furthermore, csx has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.
completed transactions acquisition of pan am systems, inc.
on june 1, 2022, csx completed its acquisition of pan am. the closing price of $600 million was funded through a combination of common stock valued at $422 million and cash totaling $178 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. total cash consideration paid to acquire the business includes a $30 million deposit paid in fourth quarter 2020. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
acquisition of quality carriers, inc.
on july 1, 2021, csx acquired quality carriers, inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash. this transaction was funded by cash on hand. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia on march 26, 2021, the company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three csx-owned line segments to the commonwealth of virginia ("commonwealth") over three phases for a total of $525 million. as of december 31, 2022, all three phases are closed. gains and proceeds in 2022 and 2021 related to this transaction are summarized in the following table. for further details, refer to note 6, properties.

csx corporation part ii credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's"), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csx's long-term credit ratings. csx's credit ratings remained stable during 2022. as of both december 2022 and december 2021, s&p's long-term rating on csx was bbb+ (stable), and moody's was baa1 (stable). ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. if csx's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. in addition, a decline in csx's credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market's demand, and thus the company's ability to readily issue new debt. the company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.
guaranteed notes issued by csxt in 2007, csxt, a wholly-owned subsidiary of csx corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023. csx corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. at csxt's option, csxt may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. in the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if csxt does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, csxt will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. the guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of csx corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of csx corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. the guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. as of december 31, 2022, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $139 million.
in accordance with sec rules, including amendments adopted in 2020, csx is not required to present separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. additionally, presentation of combined summary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.

csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates. these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis. significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:
•personal injury and environmental reserves;
•pension plan accounting;
•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and
•goodwill and other intangible assets.
personal injury and environmental reserves personal injury personal injury reserves of $126 million and $118 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. it is based largely on csxt's historical claims and settlement experience. actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.
environmental environmental reserves were $161 million and $108 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 240 environmentally impaired sites. the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:
•type of clean-up required;
•nature of the company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);
•extent of the company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and
•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

pension plan accounting the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. for employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. for employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. beginning in 2020, the csx pension plan was closed to new participants. as of december 2022, the projected benefit obligation for the company's pension plans was $2.4 billion. for information related to the funded status of the company's pension plans, see note 9, employee benefit plans.
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation-retirement benefits topic in the asc. this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:
•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;
•long-term rate of return on plan assets; and
•other assumptions.
the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. these amounts are reviewed by management.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.38
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued discount rates discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension expense. discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company's expected future benefit payments. the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.
the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity.
the weighted average discount rate used by the company to value its pension obligations was 5.02% and 2.78% as of december 2022, and december 2021, respectively. as of december 2022, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 10 years.
each year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. in general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change.
long-term rate of return on plan assets the expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. in estimating that rate, the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. as this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. the long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2022 and 2021.
other assumptions the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. these assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.

2023 estimated pension expense net periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to be a credit of $1 million. net periodic pension benefit expense for 2023 is expected to include service cost expense of $24 million. service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. net periodic pension expense in 2022 was a credit of $41 million. the net decrease in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from recent unfavorable pension asset experience, partially offset by the increase in discount rates.
the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2023 estimated pension expense:
(dollars in millions)                  pension expense discount rate                              $16
long-term rate of return                   $24
depreciation policies for assets utilizing the group-life method the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap. the company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 84% of total fixed assets of $48.1 billion on a gross basis at december 31, 2022. the remaining depreciable assets of the company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. land is not depreciated.
management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's methods to determine the service lives of its properties. there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:
•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;
•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;
•evaluation of current operations;
•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;
•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;
•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;
•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and
•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.
csx 2022 form 10-k p.40
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued the stb requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. the 2022 equipment study resulted in an expected increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020.
a 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the company's annual depreciation expense. there were no significant changes to the company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies. for additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see note 6, properties, in the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and intangible assets as of december 2022, the company had $502 million of goodwill and other intangibles - net. in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.
csx evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. in performing the qualitative impairment assessment, csx considers relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the company would perform a quantitative impairment test. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss would be recorded. measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including the documents incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions, in each case, to the extent applicable. the forward-looking statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions "business-business and growth strategies," "risk factors" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." we caution investors that forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations of future events and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. when used, the words "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "project," "should," "will" and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control. should one or more of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. we caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
the most significant factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of changes in general economic and capital market conditions, including continued inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the u.s. or global economy, as well as the other important factors below and the risks set forth in this form 10-k in part i, item 1a.
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•volatile or adverse global economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could adversely affect our access to cost-effective capital and have a resulting material adverse effect on our business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition;
•risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, continued inflation, increasing interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;
•general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, changes in client preferences and space utilization, dependence on clients' financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);
•the impact of geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing war in ukraine;
•the immediate and long-term impact of the outbreak of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as covid-19, on our and our clients' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (including the impact of actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures on our clients, and the ability of our clients to successfully operate their businesses);
•failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;
•the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;
•risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, continued inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, construction delays, increased construction costs, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits, client accounting considerations that may result in negotiated lease provisions that limit a client's liability during construction, and public opposition to such activities);
•risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments or refinance existing indebtedness, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;
•risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;
•risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;
•costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws;
•potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;
•risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change;
•risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems, which support our operations and our buildings;
•risks associated with bxp's potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended;
•possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;
•the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;
•risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and
•risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
the risks set forth above are not exhaustive. other sections of this report, including "part i, item 1a-risk factors," include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. investors should also refer to our most recent quarterly reports on form 10-q for future periods and current reports on form 8-k as we file them with the sec, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form 8-k or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
overview bxp is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (reits) (based on total market capitalization as of december 31, 2022) in the united states that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the united states - boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle, and washington, dc. bplp is the entity through which bxp conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. when making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other client's expansion rights and general economic factors.
our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients. our client base is diverse across market sectors and the weighted-average lease term for our in-place leases, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years, as of december 31, 2022, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures. the weighted-average lease term for our 20 largest clients, based on leased square footage, was approximately 10.7 years as of december 31, 2022.
to be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. in this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes:
•our understanding of our client's short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets;
•our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner;
•our reputation as a high quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets;
•our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards; and
•our relationships with local brokers.
outlook the inflation experienced in 2022 has slowly decreased but remains high. the federal reserve is expected to continue to increase interest rates, although likely at a more moderate pace, in an effort to bring prices under control. this, coupled with the discussion surrounding raising the u.s. debt ceiling could cause further turmoil in the financial markets. there have already been signs of this strain with announcements of staff reductions from large- and medium-sized employers. while the initial announcements were largely concentrated in the technology sectors, companies in the finance industry, the legal industry and broader corporate america are now announcing similar layoffs. this evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as:
•business leaders may generally become more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as entry into a new lease;
•labor market conditions shift resulting in increasing employer demands for mandatory in-person workdays and gradual increases in space utilization by our clients;
•our capital costs have increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and
•construction costs have increased for new development and, although the costs for our active development pipeline are, at this stage, relatively fixed, the cost of potential future developments continues to increase.
in light of the foregoing, we believe we are positioning ourselves for success, notwithstanding the uncertain trajectory of the u.s. and global economies, by managing our leverage while continuing to selectively invest (including both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. we remain focused on the following priorities:
•continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace industry and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. premier workplaces, the preferred choice for our current and prospective clients, are gaining market share compared to general office space and demonstrating the highest occupancy, net absorption levels and rental rates in the central business district ("cbd") markets where we operate;
•leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations;
•completing the construction and leasing of our development properties;
•pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development;
•continuing to raise the bar in the quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, which may be negatively impacted by a slowdown in the capital markets and the limited availability of private market debt financing;
•actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and
•prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments.
the following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2022.
leasing activity and occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed approximately 1.1 million square feet of new leases and renewals, for a total of approximately 5.7 million square feet leased in 2022, which is 95% of our average annual leasing volume over the last ten years. the leases executed in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 have a weighted-average lease term of approximately 7.8 years and 9.2 years, respectively, indicating that many new and existing clients continue to commit to the long-term use of space and view our properties as their preferred choice for a premier workplace environment.
the overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 88.6% at december 31, 2022, a decrease of 30 basis points from september 30, 2022. the decrease in occupancy is primarily due to fully placing in-service reston next and 880 winter street, which have leases for which revenue recognition has not commenced in accordance with gaap. excluding the impact of placing these two properties in-service, occupancy would have increased in the fourth quarter of 2022 by 20 basis points to 89.1%.
the macroeconomic environment has resulted in softening demand in all of our markets. while property tours continue and leases under negotiation move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. potential clients touring space acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions. as we consider our expectations for leasing in 2023, we have factored in the impacts of a slower economy, softer business performance, and reduced demand for space. we expect the bulk of our leasing in 2023 will continue to come from small- and medium-sized professional and financial services firms.
investment activity although the real estate capital markets for office assets has slowed substantially with u.s. transaction volume down 40% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the third quarter of 2022, we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet client demand for premier workplaces, life sciences, retail and residential space. we continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of "value-add" assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets.
consistent with this strategy, in 2022, we purchased an aggregate of approximately $1.6 billion (our share) of premier workplaces, including life sciences, and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns a premier workplace. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired a 26.69% interest in the joint venture that owns 200 fifth avenue, a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square-foot, leed gold certified, premier workplace located in new york city that is approximately 93% leased as of december 31, 2022. the acquisition of the joint venture interest is our second investment in the vibrant midtown south neighborhood. we serve as the managing member and provide customary leasing and property management services for the joint venture. we closed on the interest in the joint venture for a gross purchase price of approximately $280.2 million, which includes $120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of $160.1 million. the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 1.30% per annum and matures on november 24, 2028. the joint venture has interest rate swap contracts through june 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts.
as of december 31, 2022, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of 13 properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $1.9 billion, of which approximately $729.1 million remains to be invested. in january 2023, bxp commenced the development of 290 binney street and the redevelopment of 300 binney street at kendall center in cambridge, massachusetts. including projects that commenced in january 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment which, excluding view boston at the prudential center and reston next residential, are 52% pre-leased as of february 21, 2023. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $3.3 billion.
as we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the disposition of the avant at reston town center for a gross sale price of $141.0 million. the avant at reston town center a is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury residential building located in reston, virginia. bxp retained ownership of the approximately 26,000 square foot ground-level retail space.
including the sale of the residential component of the avant at reston town center, bxp completed the disposition of 14 properties and two land parcels, for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $864.2 million, in 2022.

for descriptions of significant transactions that we completed during 2022, see "item 1. business-transactions during 2022."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:
•purchase price allocations,
•impairment and
•impairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures.
each of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below.
real estate purchase price allocations we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-" and "below-market" leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
we record acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. acquired "above-" and "below-market" lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client's lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of madison centre in seattle, washington and 125 broadway in cambridge, massachusetts for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
impairment management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. this evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. because cash flows on properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.
unconsolidated joint ventures impairment our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. this evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. the fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.
as of december 31, 2022, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately $1.6 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately $85.4 million included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of approximately $50.7 million related to our dock 72 unconsolidated joint venture (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
income taxes our accounting policies related to income tax are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
bxp the net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of bxp's assets and liabilities was approximately $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was primarily related to the difference in basis of contributed property and accrued rental income.

at december 31, 2022 and 2021, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 194 and 201 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the "total property portfolio"). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the "same property portfolio") and the changes attributable to the properties included in the acquired, placed in-service, development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
noi is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, as applicable, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred stock/unit redemption charge, preferred dividends/distributions, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses from early extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss on non-real estate investment, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) gains (losses) from investments in securities, other income - assignment fee, interest and other income (loss), gain on sales-type lease, gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). in addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently.
we believe that in order to understand our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of bplp ("op units"). this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2022 to the year ended december 31, 2021
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 124 properties totaling approximately 37.8 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2021 and owned and in service through december 31, 2022. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment after january 1, 2021 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2022. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment or sold.

(1)rental revenue is equal to revenue less development and management services revenue and direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services revenue per the consolidated statements of operations, excluding the residential and hotel revenue that is noted below. we use rental revenue internally as a performance measure and in calculating other non-gaap financial measures (e.g., noi), which provides investors with information regarding our performance that is not immediately apparent from the comparable non-gaap measures and allows investors to compare operating performance between periods.
(2)for a detailed discussion of noi, including the reasons management believes noi is useful to investors, see page 70. residential net operating income for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is comprised of residential revenue of $57,181 and $42,668 less residential expenses of $29,583 and $24,444, respectively. hotel net operating income for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is comprised of hotel revenue of $39,482 and $13,609 less hotel expenses of $27,478 and $12,998, respectively, per the consolidated statements of operations.
same property portfolio lease revenue (excluding termination income)

termination income termination income decreased by approximately $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2022 related to approximately 29 clients across the same property portfolio and totaled approximately $6.7 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in new york city. in addition, we received a distribution from our unsecured credit claim against lehman brothers, inc. of approximately $0.6 million.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2021 related to 27 clients across the same property portfolio and totaled approximately $11.5 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in new york city and the boston region.

real estate operating expenses real estate operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $66.8 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase in operating expenses, including cleaning, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and roads/grounds/security. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in physical occupancy.

(1)average monthly rental rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (a) rental revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, by (b) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period.
(2)average physical occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)average economic occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from market rents used by us. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

other operating revenue and expense items development and management services revenue development and management services revenue increased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021. management services revenue increased by approximately $2.3 million and development services revenue decreased by approximately $1.9 million. the increase in management services revenue was primarily related to an increase in property management fees from an unconsolidated joint venture in the boston region and asset management fees from unconsolidated joint ventures in the los angeles and seattle regions. the decrease in development services revenue was primarily related to a decrease in development fees earned from unconsolidated joint venture properties in the washington, dc and boston regions, which were placed in-service during prior periods.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense of approximately $11.9 million, partially offset by an approximately $6.7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. the decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately $12.1 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan and an approximately $0.2 million increase in other compensation expenses. the increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in professional fees.
wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. capitalized wages for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs decreased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to costs incurred in connection with the pursuit and formation of new joint ventures in 2021 that did not occur at the same levels in 2022. in general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and payroll and related costs from management service contracts we have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. we anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other.
other income and expense items loss from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $57.3 million primarily due to (1) a $50.7 million non-cash impairment charge at our dock 72 joint venture during the year ended december 31, 2022, (2) a $10.3 million gain on sale of investment from the sale of our annapolis junction joint venture interest during the year ended december 31, 2021 and (3) an increase in interest expense due to increasing interest rates on variable rate debt.
the unconsolidated joint venture properties have approximately $4.0 billion of outstanding debt, which is primarily variable rate. therefore, we expect our share of joint venture income to be impacted by higher interest rates.
gains on sales of real estate gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information, see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

(2)on december 13, 2018, we sold our 6595 springfield center drive development project located in springfield, virginia. concurrently with the sale, we agreed to act as development manager and guaranteed the completion of the project. the development project achieved final completion during the third quarter of 2021 at which time the total cost of development was determined to be below the estimated total investment at the time of sale. as a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $8.1 million.
gain on sales-type lease in connection with a ground lease amendment, executed on december 19, 2022 with a third-party hotel developer, we recorded a sales-type lease receivable of approximately $13.0 million, which includes an unguaranteed residual asset of approximately $17,000. the sales-type lease receivable was measured as the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including the unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. in addition, we recorded a gain on sales-type lease of approximately $10.1 million associated with the derecognition of the asset. we did not recognize any interest income during the year ended december 31, 2022 (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest and other income (loss)
interest and other income (loss) increased by approximately $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase of approximately $7.3 million in interest income due to increased interest earned on our deposits.
other income - assignment fee on april 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive in reston, virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.6 million. on april 7, 2022, we executed an agreement to assign the right to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive to a third party for an assignment fee of approximately $6.9 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $6.6 million. 11251 roger bacon drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for bxp's officers and former non-employee directors. under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income or the non-employee director's compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. in order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to bxp's officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. during the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $(6.5) million and $5.6 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $(6.5) million and $5.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of bxp participating in the plans.
unrealized loss on non-real estate investment during the year ended december 31, 2022, we began investing in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds. as a result, we recognized an unrealized loss of $0.2 million due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.
losses from early extinguishment of debt on february 14, 2021, bplp completed the redemption of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% senior notes due may 15, 2021. the redemption price was approximately $858.7 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $8.7 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million related to unamortized origination costs.
on march 16, 2021, bplp repaid $500.0 million, representing all amounts outstanding on its delayed draw term loan facility ("delayed draw facility") under its prior unsecured revolving credit agreement. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million related to the acceleration of remaining unamortized financing costs.
on october 15, 2021, bplp used proceeds from its september 2021 offering of unsecured senior notes and borrowings under its new credit facility, which replaced the prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the "2021 credit facility") to complete the redemption of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.85% senior notes due february 1, 2023. the redemption price was approximately $1.05 billion. the redemption price included approximately $7.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 104.284% of the principal amount being redeemed. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $44.2 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $42.8 million.
on december 10, 2021, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest refinanced the mortgage loan collateralized by its 601 lexington avenue property located in new york city with a new lender. the mortgage loan has a principal amount of $1.0 billion, requires interest-only payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.79% per annum and matures on january 9, 2032. the previous mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $616.1 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum and was scheduled to mature on april 10, 2022. there was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the previous mortgage loan. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.1 million due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. as portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $52.1 million and $53.1 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
we expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates.
at december 31, 2022, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.5 billion revolving facility (the "revolving facility") and bplp's $730.0 million 2022 unsecured term loan. the revolving facility and 2022 unsecured term loan had approximately $730.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2022 (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership increased by approximately $40.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2022. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.
preferred stock/unit redemption charge on march 2, 2021, bxp issued a redemption notice for 80,000 shares of its 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("series b preferred stock"), which constituted all of the outstanding series b preferred stock, and the corresponding depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of series b preferred stock (the "depositary shares"). in connection with the redemption of the series b preferred stock, all of the series b preferred units, which had terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the series b preferred stock, were redeemed by bplp. the redemption price per share of series b preferred stock was $2,500, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, totaling $2,516.41 per share.  on march 31, 2021, we transferred the full redemption price for all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of approximately $201.3 million, including approximately $1.3 million of accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, to the redemption agent. the excess of the redemption price over the carrying value of the series b preferred stock and series b preferred units of approximately $6.4 million relates to the original issuance costs and is reflected as a reduction to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders on the consolidated income statement.
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:
•fund normal recurring expenses;
•meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including the $500 million of 3.125% unsecured senior notes maturing september 1, 2023;
•fund development and redevelopment costs;
•fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;
•fund pending and possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests therein; and
•make the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;
•cash and cash equivalent balances;
•borrowings under bplp's revolving facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans;
•long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness);
•sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate;
•private equity sources, including through our strategic capital program ("scp") with large institutional investors; and
•issuances of bxp equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in bplp.
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. we expect to fund our current development/redevelopment properties primarily with our available cash balances, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from asset sales and bplp's revolving facility. we use bplp's revolving facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by bplp, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(2)each of investment to date, estimated total investment and estimated future equity requirement represent our share of acquisition expenses, as applicable, and reflect our share of the estimated net revenue/expenses that we expect to incur prior to stabilization of the project, including any amounts actually received or paid through december 31, 2022.
(3)includes approximately $76.9 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.
(4)excludes approximately $76.9 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.
(5)represents percentage leased as of february 21, 2023, including leases with future commencement dates.
(6)the property was 64% placed in-service as of december 31, 2022.
(7)investment to date includes all related costs incurred prior to the contribution of the property by us to the joint venture on december 15, 2021 totaling approximately $107 million and our proportionate share of the loan. our joint venture partners will fund required capital until their aggregate investment is approximately 58% of all capital contributions; thereafter, the joint venture partners will fund required capital according to their percentage interests.
(8)estimated total investment represents the costs to complete building a, a 389,500 square foot building, and building a's proportionate share of land and garage costs. in conjunction with the construction of building a, garage and site work will be completed for phase ii, which will support approximately 700,000 square feet of development in two office buildings, budgeted to be an incremental $141 million.
(9)reston next retail was previously included within the reston next project.
(10)we expect to place this project in-service and open to the public in the second quarter of 2023.
(11)percentage leased excludes the residential property and the view boston observatory at the prudential center (redevelopment) at 800 boylston street - the prudential center. estimated total investment excludes approximately $1.2 billion related to the development of 290 binney street and approximately $210 million related to the redevelopment of 300 binney street which was still in-service at december 31, 2022. we terminated our existing lease agreement with a client at 300 binney street to facilitate the redevelopment of the property, which commenced in january 2023. 290 binney street and 300 binney street are 100% pre-leased. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
lease revenue (which includes recoveries from clients), other income from operations, available cash balances, mortgage financings, unsecured indebtedness and draws on bplp's revolving facility are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. we believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows.
we expect our primary uses of capital over the next twelve months will be to fund the continuation and completion of our current and committed development and redevelopment projects, repay debt maturities (as discussed below), service the interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and satisfy our reit distribution requirements.
as of december 31, 2022, we had 13 properties under development or redevelopment. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $1.9 billion, of which approximately $729.1 million remains to be funded with equity through 2026. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we commenced the redevelopment of 105 carnegie center in princeton, new jersey. 105 carnegie center is an approximately 70,000 net rentable square feet property that will be converted into an approximately 73,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences property for an approximate cost of $40.6 million.
in january 2023, we added the following new projects to our active development and redevelopment portfolio (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements):
•290 binney steet in cambridge, massachusetts, an approximately 566,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project. the project has a total budget of approximately $1.2 billion and is expected to be completed in 2026. the project is 100% pre-leased to astrazeneca.
•300 binney street in cambridge, massachusetts. the conversion of this approximately 195,000 net rentable square foot property into an approximately 240,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property has a total budgeted cost of $210.0 million. this project is 100% pre-leased.
as of february, 21, 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $3.3 billion.
on november 17, 2022, we acquired a 26.69% interest in the joint venture that owns 200 fifth avenue for a gross purchase price of approximately $280.2 million, which include $120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of $160.1 million. 200 fifth avenue is a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square foot leed gold certified, premier workplace located in the midtown south submarket of manhattan, new york. the property was 93% leased as of december 31, 2022.
in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the residential component of the avant at reston town center, located in reston, virginia, for a gross sale price of $141.0 million. the avant is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury multifamily property.
aggregating our pro rata share of 2022 capital markets activity, we purchased properties or interests in joint ventures that own property of approximately $1.6 billion, sold properties or parcels of land for gross sales prices of approximately $864.2 million, commenced development and redevelopment projects, including projects that commenced in the first quarter of 2023, of approximately $2.0 billion and completed approximately $1.8 billion of debt financing.
in july 2021, we announced the formation of the scp with two partners each having a targeted equity commitment of $1.0 billion and a $250 million commitment from us. under this agreement, we agreed to provide these partners, for up to two years, exclusive first offers to form joint ventures with us to invest in assets that meet target criteria. all investments are discretionary to each partner.
the scp provides us the opportunity to partner with large institutional investors and capitalize our investment opportunities partially through private equity. the scp enhances our access to capital and investment capacity, enhances our returns through fee income, and in some investments provides us the opportunity to realize a greater share of income upon achieving certain success criteria. these large financial partners are among the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and pension plans. as we move forward, we anticipate increasing our use of joint venture partner equity to manage our debt levels.
on january 4, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $1.2 billion unsecured term loan facility (the "2023 unsecured term loan"). under the credit agreement, we may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 unsecured term loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. the 2023 unsecured term loan matures on may 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. upon entry into the credit agreement, we borrowed the full $1.2 billion available under the 2023 unsecured term loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 unsecured term loan, which was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023.
after repayment of the $730.0 million 2022 unsecured term loan on january 4, 2023, our remaining 2023 and 2024 debt maturities include (1) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of bplp's 3.125% senior unsecured notes, which mature on september 1, 2023, (2) $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of bplp's 3.800% senior unsecured notes, which mature on february 1, 2024 and (3) the $1.2 billion 2023 unsecured term loan. in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, we have approximately $603.2 million (our share) of debt maturating in 2023 and 2024. we expect to fund 2023 and 2024 debt maturities using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on bplp's revolving facility, and/or through refinancings. we expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates.
as of february 21, 2023, we had available cash of approximately $833.3 million (of which approximately $79.9 million is attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately $1.5 billion available under the revolving facility and our available cash, as of february 21, 2023, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced), satisfy our reit distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities.
we may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. depending on interest rates, the overall conditions in the debt and public and private equity markets, and our leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources (including utilization of bxp's $600.0 million "at the market" equity offering program). doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, which could increase our net interest expense or be dilutive to our earnings, or both.
we have not sold any shares under bxp's $600.0 million "at the market" equity offering program.
inflation we are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. there are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. these provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. however, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation.
reit tax distribution considerations dividend bxp as a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that bxp currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is for bxp to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. common and ltip unitholders (other than unearned myltip units) of limited partnership interest in bplp receive the same total distribution per unit.
bxp's board of directors will continue to evaluate bxp's dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by bxp's board of directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount.
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, bxp would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of bxp's common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that bxp would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for bxp to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
from time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable reit regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs"). such a sale by a trs would be subject to federal and local taxes.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately $736.8 million and $501.2 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $235.7 million. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. the weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years as of december 31, 2022, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 88% to 94%. generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 is detailed below:

consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. we present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (a) our consolidated debt by (b) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:
(1) our consolidated debt; plus
(2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of bxp common stock on december 31, 2022, as reported by the new york stock exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:
(i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of bxp,
(ii) the number of outstanding op units in bplp (excluding op units held by bxp),
(iii) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, and
(iv) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2012 opp units, and 2013 - 2019 myltip units that were issued in the form of ltip units.
the calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include ltip units issued in the form of myltip awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2020 - 2022 myltip units are not included in this calculation as of december 31, 2022.
we also present bxp's share of market capitalization and bxp's share of debt/bxp's share of market capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that bxp's share of debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. bxp's share of debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners' share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners' percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). management believes that bxp's share of debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners' share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. we have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  we caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating bxp's share of debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. for example, in addition to partners' interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters.  moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case gaap requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. in other cases, gaap requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. as a result, management believes that the presentation of bxp's share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
we present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of bxp and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like bxp, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
for a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see "liquidity and capital resources-investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and for a discussion of our consolidated joint venture indebtedness see "liquidity and capital resources-mortgage notes payable" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
debt financing as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $14.2 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 54.63% of our consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $10.2 billion (net of discount and deferred financing fees) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.69% per annum and maturities in 2023 through 2033, (2) $3.3 billion (net of deferred financing fees) of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.42% per annum and a weighted-average term of 5.8 years and (3) $730.0 million outstanding under bplp's 2022 unsecured term loan that was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023 and was repaid subsequent to december 31, 2022 (see notes 7 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements).

unsecured credit facility on june 15, 2021, bplp amended and restated its prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the "2021 credit facility"). the 2021 credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.5 billion through the revolving facility, subject to customary conditions. among other things, the 2021 credit facility (1) extended the maturity date from april 24, 2022 to june 15, 2026, (2) eliminated the $500.0 million delayed draw facility (3) reduced the per annum variable interest rates on borrowings and (4) added a sustainability-linked pricing component. under the 2021 credit facility, bplp may increase the total commitment by up to $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. based on bplp's december 31, 2022 credit rating, (1) the applicable eurocurrency and libor daily floating rate margins are 0.775%, (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.15% per annum. the 2021 credit facility includes provisions which allow libor daily floating rate to be switched to sofr.
at december 31, 2022 and february 21, 2023, bplp had no borrowings under its revolving facility and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $6.4 million, with the ability to borrow approximately $1.5 billion.
unsecured term loans on may 17, 2022, bplp entered into the 2022 unsecured term loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to $730.0 million. the 2022 unsecured term loan was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023.
at bplp's option, the 2022 unsecured term loan bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (a) (1) a base rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate, (c) term sofr plus 1.00% and (d) 1.00%, or (2) a term sofr rate per annum equal to the forward-looking sofr term rate administered by cme group benchmark administration ("cme") two business days prior to the commencement of such interest period; or if the rate was unavailable, then the forward-looking sofr term rate administered by cme on the first business day immediately prior thereto, in each case, plus 0.10%, and (b) a margin ranging from zero to 160 basis points based on bplp's credit rating.
on may 17, 2022, bplp exercised its option to draw $730.0 million under the 2022 unsecured term loan (see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements). as of december 31, 2022, the 2022 unsecured term loan bore interest at a variable rate equal to term sofr plus 0.95% per annum based on bplp's credit rating at december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2022, bplp had $730.0 million outstanding under its 2022 unsecured term loan. the 2022 unsecured term loan was repaid in full on january 4, 2023 with proceeds from the credit agreement entered into on that date (the 2023 unsecured term loan) as further discussed below.
on january 4, 2023, bplp entered into the 2023 unsecured term loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to $1.2 billion. under the credit agreement, bplp may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 unsecured term loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. the 2023 unsecured term loan matures on may 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions.
at bplp's option, the 2023 unsecured term loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate, (c) term sofr for a one-month period plus 1.00%, and (d) 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on bplp's credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted term sofr with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on bplp's credit rating.
on january 4, 2023, upon entry into the credit agreement, bplp exercised its option to draw $1.2 billion under the 2023 unsecured term loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 unsecured term loan, which was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023. based on the bplp's credit rating upon entry into the credit agreement, the base rate margin is zero basis points and the term sofr margin is 85 basis points.
unsecured senior notes for a description of bplp's outstanding unsecured senior notes as of december 31, 2022, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
on november 17, 2022, bplp completed a public offering of $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.750% unsecured senior notes due 2027. the notes were priced at 99.941% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 6.924% per annum to maturity. the notes will mature on december 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed. the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $743.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.
the indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. at december 31, 2022, bplp was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.

(12)the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 1.30% per annum and matures on november 24, 2028. the joint venture entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million through june 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts. in addition to items noted in footnote one above, the gaap interest rate includes the adjustment required to reflect the loan at fair value upon acquisition.
(13)we provided $80.0 million of mortgage financing to the joint venture. the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 3.50% per annum and matures on july 13, 2023, with extension options, subject to certain conditions. the loan has been reflected as related party note receivable, net on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2022, the loan has approximately $19.1 million of accrued interest due at the maturity date.
(14)the indebtedness consists of (x) a $305.0 million mortgage loan payable which bears interest at a variable rate equal to sofr plus approximately 1.81% and matures on april 9, 2024 with three, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions, and (y) a $115.0 million mezzanine note payable which bears interest at a variable rate equal to sofr plus 5.25% and matures on april 9, 2024 with three, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. the joint venture entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a financial institution to limit its exposure to increases in the sofr rate at a cap of 4.50% per annum on a notional amount of $420.0 million through april 15, 2024.
(15)the construction financing has a borrowing capacity of $140.0 million. the construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to sofr plus 2.00% per annum and matures on may 13, 2026, with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions.
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. approximately 94.9% of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
at december 31, 2022, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding consolidated debt was 3.51% per annum. at december 31, 2022, we had $730.0 million of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding. at december 31, 2022, the gaap interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 4.85% per annum. if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $7.3 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended december 31, 2022.
the information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. for a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt."
funds from operations pursuant to the revised definition of funds from operations adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), we calculate funds from operations, or "ffo," for each of bxp and bplp by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income (loss) attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (computed in accordance with gaap), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and helps make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

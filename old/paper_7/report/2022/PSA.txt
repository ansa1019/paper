item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
critical accounting estimates:
the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates, because they are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that involve a significant level of uncertainty.
impairment of long-lived assets: the analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets, including our real estate facilities, involves identification of indicators of impairment, including unfavorable operational results and significant cost overruns on construction, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. in particular, these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the projections of future rental rates, stabilized occupancy level, future profit margin, discount rates, and capitalization rates, all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions. others could come to materially different conclusions.
allocating purchase price for acquired real estate facilities: we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities of acquired real estate facilities, which consist principally of land and buildings, for purposes of allocating the aggregate purchase price of acquired real estate facilities. we estimate the fair value of land based upon price per square foot derived from observable transactions involving comparable land in similar locations as adjusted for location quality, parcel size, and date of sale associated with the acquired facilities. the fair value estimate of land is sensitive to the adjustments made to the land market transactions used in the estimate, particularly when there is a lack of recent comparable land market data. for large portfolio acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of buildings primarily using the income approach by estimating the fair value of hypothetical vacant acquired facilities and adjusting for the estimated fair value of land. for individual and small portfolio acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of buildings primarily based upon the estimated current replacement cost, which we calculate by estimating the replacement cost of new purpose-built self-storage facilities in similar geographic regions and adjusting for age, quality, amenities, and configuration associated with the buildings acquired. the fair value estimate of buildings is sensitive to assumptions used in both the income approach, such as lease-up period, future stabilized operating cash flows, capitalization rate and discount rate, and in the replacement cost approach, such as current cost adjustment, soft cost and developer profit estimates. others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values of land and buildings, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, as well as the level of land and buildings on our consolidated balance sheet.
overview our self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of growth within our same store facilities (as defined below) as well as within our acquired facilities and newly developed and expanded facilities (both as defined below). accordingly, a significant portion of management's time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facility portfolio.
during 2022, revenues generated by our same store facilities increased by 14.8% ($409.9 million), as compared to 2021, while same store cost of operations increased by 5.7% ($39.9 million). demand and operating trends softened in the second half of 2022 and returned to historical seasonal patterns as compared to what we experienced in 2020 and 2021. we expect the trends to continue in 2023.
in addition to managing our existing facilities for organic growth, we have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. since the beginning of 2020, we acquired a total of 368 facilities with 31.7 million net rentable square feet for $6.6 billion. in our non-same store portfolio, we also have developed and expanded self-storage facilities of 17.7 million net rentable square feet for a total cost of $1.6 billion. during 2022, net operating income generated by our acquired facilities and newly developed and expanded facilities increased 98.2% ($226.3 million), as compared to 2021.
we have experienced recent inflationary impacts on our cost of operations, including labor, utilities, and repairs and maintenance, and costs of development and expansion activities, and we may continue to experience such impacts in the future. we have implemented various initiatives to manage the adverse impacts, such as enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours, achievement of economies of scale from recent acquisitions with supervisory payroll allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities, and investments in solar power and led lights to lower utility usage.
in order to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors (including newly developed facilities), we have embarked on our multi-year property of tomorrow program to (i) rebrand our properties with more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage, (ii) enhance the energy efficiency of our properties, and (iii) upgrade the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. we expect to complete the program by the end of 2025. we spent approximately $189 million on the program in 2022 and expect to spend approximately $160 million in 2023 on this effort.
on april 24, 2022, psb entered into an agreement and plan of merger whereby affiliates of blackstone real estate ("blackstone") agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of psb's common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. on july 20, 2022, psb announced that it completed the merger transaction with blackstone. each share of psb common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in psb were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit, including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit, and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit, for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. at the close of the merger transaction, we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion, which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in ps business parks, inc. in the consolidated statement of income.
in connection with the sale of our equity investment in psb, on august 4, 2022, we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share, totaling approximately $2.3 billion, to shareholders of record as of august 1, 2022.
on february 5, 2023, we disclosed that we made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of life storage for consideration consisting of public storage common shares at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 public storage common shares for each outstanding life storage share or unit. our public offer followed prior rebuffs by life storage of our attempts to negotiate privately. for more detail about the proposal, please see our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on february 6, 2023. on february 16, 2023, life storage announced it had rejected the offer. we currently intend to pursue the proposed transaction. in the event we enter into and consummate an acquisition of life storage, the acquisition would have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
on february 4, 2023, our board of trustees declared a 50% increase in its regular common quarterly dividend from $2.00 to $3.00 per share, payable on march 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of march 15, 2023. the distribution equates to an annualized increase to the company's regular common dividend from $8.00 to $12.00 per share.
results of operations operating results for 2022 and 2021
in 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $4,142.3 million or $23.50 per diluted common share, compared to $1,732.4 million or $9.87 per diluted common share in 2021, representing an increase of $2,409.9 million or $13.63 per diluted common share. the increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in psb and (ii) a $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income, partially offset by (iii) a $174.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) a $125.1 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to sale of our equity investment in psb, and (v) a $45.5 million increase in interest expense.
the $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2022 as compared to 2021 is a result of a $370.1 million increase attributable to our same store facilities and a $244.2 million increase attributable to our non-same store facilities. revenues for the same store facilities increased 14.8% or $409.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. cost of operations for the same store facilities increased by 5.7% or $39.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. the increase in net operating income of $244.2 million for the non-same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.
operating results for 2021 and 2020
in 2021, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,732.4 million or $9.87 per diluted common share, compared to $1,098.3 million or $6.29 per diluted common share in 2020, representing an increase of $634.1 million or $3.58 per diluted common share. the increase is due primarily to (i) a $437.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income, (ii) a $209.7 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains associated with our euro denominated notes payable, and (iii) our $149.0 million equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by psb in 2021, partially offset by (iv) a $160.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.
the $437.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2021 as compared to 2020 is a result of a $279.5 million increase in our same store facilities and a $157.9 million increase in our non-same store facilities. revenues for the same store facilities increased 10.6% or $265.8 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot and weighted average square foot occupancy. cost of operations for the same store facilities decreased by 1.9% or $13.8 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to (i) a 36.1% ($22.4 million) decrease in marketing expenses and (ii) an 11.2% ($14.4 million) decrease in on-site property manager payroll. the increase in net operating income of $157.9 million for the non-same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2020 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.
funds from operations and core funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") and ffo per share are non-gaap measures defined by nareit. we believe that ffo and ffo per share are useful to reit investors and analysts in measuring our performance because nareit's definition of ffo excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. ffo represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. ffo also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. ffo and ffo per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. ffo is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. in addition, other reits may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among reits may not be helpful.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, ffo was $16.46 per diluted common share as compared to $13.36 and $9.75 per diluted common share for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase in 2022 of 23.2%, or $3.10 per diluted common share, as compared to 2021.
we also present "core ffo" and "core ffo per share" non-gaap measures that represent ffo and ffo per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties, unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs, severance of a senior executive, lease termination income, and casualties from our equity investees. we review core ffo and core ffo per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance and we believe they are used by investors and reit analysts in a similar manner. however, core ffo and core ffo per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. because other reits may not compute core ffo or core ffo per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such measures, core ffo and core ffo per share may not be comparable among reits.

(a)net operating income or "noi" is a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, which is based upon historical real estate costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. we utilize noi in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating property operating trends. we believe that investors and analysts utilize noi in a similar manner. noi is not a substitute for net income, operating cash flow, or other related financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. see note 13 to our december 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of noi to our total net income for all periods presented.
same store facilities the same store facilities consist of facilities we have owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since january 1, 2020. the composition of our same store facilities allows us more effectively to evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. we believe investors and analysts use same store information in a similar manner. however, because other reits may not compute same store facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, same store facilities may not be comparable among reits.
the following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,276 facilities (149.1 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 73% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our u.s. consolidated self-storage portfolio at december 31, 2022. it includes various measures and detail that we do not include in the analysis of the developed, acquired, and other non-same store facilities, due to the relative magnitude and importance of the same store facilities relative to our other self-storage facilities.

(a)revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. see "ancillary operations" below for more information.
(b)direct net operating income ("direct noi"), a subtotal within noi, is a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. we utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors.
(c)realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. realized annual rent per available square foot ("revpaf") is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. these measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. in addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. these measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.
(d)annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.
analysis of same store revenue we believe a balanced occupancy and rate strategy maximizes our revenues over time. we regularly adjust rental rates and promotional discounts offered (generally, "$1.00 rent for the first month"), as well as our marketing efforts to maximize revenue from new tenants to replace tenants that vacate.
we typically increase rental rates to our long-term tenants (generally, those who have been with us for at least a year) every six to twelve months. as a result, the number of long-term tenants we have in our facilities is an important factor in our revenue growth. the level of rate increases to long-term tenants is based upon evaluating the additional revenue from the increase against the negative impact of incremental move-outs, by considering customers' in-place rent and prevailing market rents, among other factors.
revenues generated by our same store facilities increased 14.8% and 10.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year. the increase in 2022 is due primarily to (i) a 16.4% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot for 2022 as compared to 2021, partially offset by (ii) a 1.5% decrease in average occupancy for 2022 as compared to 2021. the increase in 2021 is due primarily to (i) an 8.9% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot for 2021 as compared to 2020 and, to a lesser extent, (ii) a 1.9% increase in average occupancy for 2021 as compared to 2020.
our growth in revenues, realized annual rent per occupied square foot, and revpaf for 2022 as compared to 2021 was evident in each of our markets. our weighted average square foot occupancy remained strong across our markets for 2022.
the increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot in 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 was due to rate increases to existing long-term tenants in substantially all of our markets in 2022 as compared to curtailed increases in certain markets in 2021, combined with a 6.2% increase in average rates per square foot charged to new tenants moving in, as a result of strong customer demand in most of our markets. these improvements were partially offset by increases in move-out activity and promotional discounts given during 2022 as compared to 2021. at december 31, 2022, annual contract rent per occupied square foot was 15.3% higher as compared to december 31, 2021.
we experienced high occupancy levels throughout 2022 with a weighted average square foot occupancy of 94.9%, although representing a decrease of 1.5% during 2022 as compared to 2021. year-over-year move-out volumes increased 9.7% and year-over-year move-in volumes increased 4.5% in 2022 as compared to 2021, leading to a lower square foot occupancy at december 31, 2022 of 92.4% as compared to 94.8% at december 31, 2021.
move-out volumes were partially impacted by rental rate increases to our existing tenants in 2022 as compared to 2021. however, move-out activity from tenants not receiving increases was also higher in 2022 compared to 2021 but remains below pre-2020 levels. average length of stay of our tenants increased in 2022 as compared to 2021, which supported our revenue growth by contributing to the number of tenants eligible for rental rate increases in 2022.
in order to attract more new tenants to replace those that vacated in the second half of 2022, we took a number of actions including increasing promotional discounting, reducing rental rates to new customers, and increasing marketing expense.
demand historically has been higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants have typically been higher in the summer months than in the winter months. more typical seasonal patterns of demand with lower demand in the winter months returned in 2022. demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. demand for our facilities is also impacted by new supply of self-storage space and alternatives to self-storage.
we expect weaker demand in 2023 as compared to 2022 driven by a weaker macroeconomic outlook and more limited moving activities, with move-out activities and occupancy levels returning to pre-2020 levels. we will continue to support demand levels with increased marketing expense, lowering rental rates to new customers, and increased promotional discounting. as a result, we expect revenue growth to decline significantly in 2023 as compared to high levels of growth in 2022 and 2021. with a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways for 2023, the range of potential revenue growth rates is wide including the potential for year-over-year declines in revenue in the second half of 2023.
late charges and administrative fees late charges and administrative fees increased 23.0% in 2022 and decreased 1.8% in 2021, in each case as compared to the previous year. the increase in 2022 is due to (i) higher late charges collected on delinquent accounts driven by more delinquent accounts compared to 2021 and to a lesser extent (ii) higher administrative fees charged per move-in combined with higher move-in volumes. the decrease in 2021 as compared to 2020 is due to (i) an acceleration in average collections whereby a greater percentage of tenants paid their monthly rent promptly to avoid the incurrence of such fees and (ii) reduced move-in administrative fees due to lower move-ins.

analysis of same store cost of operations cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased 5.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 1.9% in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to decreased marketing expense and on-site property manager payroll expense, partially offset by increased property tax expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs.
property tax expense increased 4.3% and 3.7% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year, as a result of higher assessed values. we expected property tax expense growth of approximately 5.3% in 2023 due primarily to higher assessed values.
on-site property manager payroll expense increased 4.1% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased 11.2% in 2021 as compared to 2020. the increase in 2022 is primarily due to competitive labor conditions experienced in most geographical markets, partially offset by a decline in hours worked driven by revisions in operational processes. the decrease in 2021 is primarily due to (i) a year-over-year decline in hours worked due to staffing reductions from reduced move-in and move-out activity and revisions to other operational processes and (ii) a temporary $3.00 hourly incentive increase and enhancement of paid time off benefits to all of our property managers between april 1, 2020 and june 30, 2020 in response to the covid pandemic, partially offset by wage increases in response to competitive labor conditions experienced in most geographical markets since the second quarter of 2021. we expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase in 2023 driven by increased wage rates, partially offset by expected reduction in labor hours driven by revisions in operational processes.
marketing expense includes internet advertising and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center. internet advertising expense, comprising keyword search fees assessed on a "per click" basis, varies based upon demand for self-storage space, the quantity of people inquiring about self-storage through online search, occupancy levels, the number and aggressiveness of bidding competitors, and other factors. these factors are volatile; accordingly, internet advertising can increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. we increased marketing expense by 15.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021, by utilizing a higher volume of online paid search programs to attract new tenants. we decreased marketing expense by 36.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to lower volume of paid search programs we utilized in 2021 given strong demand and high occupancies in many of our same store properties.
other direct property costs include administrative expenses specific to each self-storage facility, such as property loss, telephone and data communication lines, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities' cash receipts, tenant mailings, credit card fees, eviction costs, and the cost of operating each property's rental office. these costs increased 10.0% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 7.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020. these increases were due primarily to an increase in credit card fees as result of year-over-year increases in revenues, and to a lesser extent, a long-term trend of more customers paying with credit cards rather than cash, checks, or other methods of payment with lower transaction costs. we expect a moderate increase in other direct property costs in 2023 primarily driven by increase in credit card fees.
centralized management costs represents administrative and cash compensation expenses for shared general corporate functions to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. such functions include information technology support, hardware, and software, as well as centralized administration of payroll, benefits, training, facilities management, customer service, pricing and marketing, operational accounting and finance, and legal costs. centralized management costs increased 11.9% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 12.7% in 2021 as compared to 2020. these increases were due primarily to an increase in technology and data team costs that support property operations. we expect centralized managements costs to remain flat in 2023 compared to 2022.

(b)revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. see "ancillary operations" below for more information.
(c)the acquired facilities have an aggregate of approximately 31.7 million net rentable square feet, including 11.2 million in texas, 3.9 million in maryland, 1.8 million in florida, 1.2 million in oklahoma, 1.1 million in virginia, 0.9 million in north carolina, 0.8 million in each of arizona, colorado and ohio, 0.6 million in each of california, georgia, illinois, minnesota, and south carolina, 0.5 million in each of idaho, indiana, michigan, missouri, nebraska, oregon, and pennsylvania, 0.4 million in each of alabama, nevada, and tennessee, 0.3 million in washington, and 1.2 million in other states.
we have been active in acquiring facilities in recent years. since the beginning of 2020, we acquired a total of 368 facilities with 31.7 million net rentable square feet for $6.6 billion. during 2022, these facilities contributed net operating income of $267.0 million.
during 2022, we acquired the neighborhood storage portfolio in the ocala, florida market, consisting of 28 properties with 1.2 million net rentable square feet, which includes 26 properties closed in december 2022 for $179.8 million and two properties that are under construction and expected to close in early 2023.
during 2021, we acquired the ezstorage portfolio, consisting of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) for acquisition cost of $1.8 billion. included in the acquisition results in the table above are ezstorage portfolio revenues of $100.8 million, noi of $79.9 million (including direct noi of $82.7 million), and average square footage occupancy of 89.6% for 2022.
during 2021, we acquired the all storage portfolio, consisting of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) for $1.5 billion. included in the acquisition results in the table above are all storage portfolio revenues of $79.2 million, noi of $48.4 million (including direct noi of $51.2 million), and average square footage occupancy of 79.4% for 2022.
we remain active in seeking to acquire additional self-storage facilities. subsequent to december 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities across five states with 0.5 million net rentable square feet, for $70.5 million. future acquisition volume is likely to be impacted by increasing cost of capital requirements and overall macro-economic uncertainties.
developed and expanded facilities the developed and expanded facilities include 62 facilities that were developed on new sites since january 1, 2017, and 91 facilities expanded to increase their net rentable square footage. of these expansions, 51 were completed before 2021, 27 were completed in 2021 or 2022, and 13 are currently in process at december 31, 2022. the following table summarizes operating data with respect to the developed and expanded facilities:

(a)represents the percentage change with respect to square foot occupancy and annual contract rent per occupied square foot, and the absolute nominal change with respect to all other items.
(b)revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales generated at the facilities. see "ancillary operations" below for more information.
(c)the facilities included above have an aggregate of approximately 17.7 million net rentable square feet at december 31, 2022, including 5.0 million in texas, 3.2 million in florida, 2.2 million in california, 1.5 million in colorado, 1.4 million in minnesota, 0.9 million in north carolina, 0.7 million in michigan, 0.4 million in each of missouri, new jersey, south carolina, and washington, 0.3 million in virginia, and 0.9 million in other states.
(d)these amounts only include the direct cost incurred to expand and renovate these facilities, and do not include (i) the original cost to develop or acquire the facility or (ii) the lost revenue on space demolished during the construction and fill-up period.
it typically takes at least three to four years for a newly developed or expanded self-storage facility to stabilize with respect to revenues. physical occupancy can be achieved as early as two to three years following completion of the development or expansion through offering lower rental rates during fill-up. as a result, even after achieving high occupancy, there can still be a period of elevated revenue growth as the tenant base matures and higher rental rates are achieved.
we believe that our development and redevelopment activities generate favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long run. however, in the short run, our earnings are diluted during the construction and stabilization period due to the cost of capital to fund the development cost, as well as the related construction and development overhead expenses included in general and administrative expense.
we typically underwrite new developments to stabilize at approximately an 8.0% noi yield on cost. our developed facilities have thus far leased up as expected and are at various stages of their revenue stabilization periods. the actual annualized yields that we may achieve on these facilities upon stabilization will depend on many factors, including local and current market conditions in the vicinity of each property and the level of new and existing supply.
the facilities under "expansions completed" represent those facilities where the expansions have been completed at december 31, 2022. we incurred a total of $709.9 million in direct cost to expand these facilities, demolished a total of 1.2 million net rentable square feet of storage space, and built a total of 6.3 million net rentable square feet of new storage space.
at december 31, 2022, we had 22 additional facilities in development, which will have a total of 2.1 million net rentable square feet of storage space and have an aggregate development cost totaling approximately $492.3 million. we expect these facilities to open over the next 18 to 24 months.
the facilities under "expansion in process" represent those facilities where construction is in process at december 31, 2022, and together with additional future expansion activities primarily related to our same store facilities at december 31, 2022, we expect to add a total of 2.5 million net rentable square feet of storage space by expanding existing self-storage facilities for an aggregate direct development cost of $487.3 million.
other non-same store facilities the "other non-same store facilities" represent facilities which, while not newly acquired, developed, or expanded, are not fully stabilized since january 1, 2020, including facilities undergoing fill-up as well as facilities damaged in casualty events such as hurricanes, floods, and fires.
the other non-same store facilities have an aggregate of 5.7 million net rentable square feet, including 1.1 million in texas, 0.6 million in each of florida and washington, 0.4 million in each of california and virginia, 0.3 million in each of indiana and south carolina, 0.2 million in each of arizona, georgia, kentucky, massachusetts, and tennessee, and 1.0 million in other states.
during 2022, 2021, and 2020, the average occupancy for these facilities totaled 91.4%, 92.7%, and 85.5%, respectively, and the realized rent per occupied square foot totaled $18.42, $14.61, and $12.69, respectively.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for self-storage operations increased $174.7 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased $160.2 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to newly acquired facilities of $5.1 billion in 2021. we expect continued increases in depreciation expense in 2023 as a result of elevated levels of capital expenditures and new facilities that are acquired, developed or expanded in 2023.
the following discussion and analysis of the components of net income, including ancillary operations and items not allocated to segments, present a comparison for the year ended december 31, 2022 to the year ended december 31, 2021. the results of these components for the years ended december 31, 2021 compared to december 31, 2020 was included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021 on page 23, under part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," which was filed with the sec on february 22, 2022.
ancillary operations ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities, sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities, and management of property owned by unrelated third parties. the following table sets forth our ancillary operations:

tenant reinsurance operations: tenant reinsurance premium revenue increased $21.6 million or 13.0% in 2022 over 2021, as a result of an increase in our tenant base with respect to acquired, newly developed, and expanded facilities and the third party properties we manage. tenant reinsurance premium revenue generated from tenants at our same-store facilities were $139.0 million and $133.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a 3.8% year over year increase in 2022.
we expect future growth will come primarily from customers of newly acquired and developed facilities, as well as additional tenants at our existing unstabilized self-storage facilities.
cost of operations primarily includes claims paid as well as claims adjustment expenses. claims expenses vary based upon the number of insured tenants and the volume of events that drive covered customer losses, such as burglary, as well as catastrophic weather events affecting multiple properties such as hurricanes and floods. included in cost of operations are $2.7 million of estimated claims costs related to hurricane ian for 2022, as compared to $2.0 million of estimated claims costs related to hurricane ida for 2021.
merchandise sales: sales of locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities are primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities. we do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our merchandise sales in 2023.
third-party property management: at december 31, 2022, in our third-party property management program, we managed 114 facilities for unrelated third parties, and were under contract to manage 78 additional facilities including 73
facilities that are currently under construction. during 2022, we added 60 facilities to the program, acquired three facilities from the program, and had 17 properties exit the program due to sales to other buyers. while we expect this business to increase in scope and size, we do not expect any significant changes in overall profitability of this business in the near term as we seek new properties to manage and are in the earlier stages of fill-up for newly managed properties.

as a result of closing the sale of psb, we will no longer recognize equity in earnings from psb in the future.
investment in shurgard: included in our equity earnings from shurgard for the year ended december 31, 2022 is our equity share of gains on sale of real estate totaling $3.5 million.
for purposes of recording our equity in earnings from shurgard, the euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.070 u.s. dollars per euro at december 31, 2022 (1.134 at december 31, 2021), and average exchange rates of 1.054 for 2022 and 1.183 for 2021. accordingly, our equity in earnings from shurgard was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro by approximately 10.9% during the year ended december 31, 2022.

interest expense: for 2022 and 2021, we incurred $142.4 million and $94.3 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding notes payable. in determining interest expense, these amounts were offset by capitalized interest of $6.0 million and $3.5 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, associated with our development activities. the increase of interest expense in 2022 as compared to 2021 is due to our issuances of debt to fund our 2021 acquisition activity. at december 31, 2022, we had $6.9 billion of notes payable outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.0%.
foreign currency exchange gain: for 2022, we recorded foreign currency gains of $98.3 million, representing primarily the changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent of our euro-denominated unsecured notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates (gains of $111.8 million for 2021). the euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.070 u.s. dollars per euro at december 31, 2022 and 1.134 at december 31, 2021. future gains and losses on foreign currency will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of the euro to the u.s. dollar and the level of euro-denominated notes payable outstanding.
gain on sale of real estate: in 2022 and 2021, we recorded gains on sale of real estate totaling $1.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in connection with the partial sale of real estate facilities pursuant to eminent domain proceedings.
liquidity and capital resources overview and our sources of capital while operating as a reit allows us to minimize the payment of u.s. federal corporate income tax expense, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. notwithstanding this requirement, our annual operating retained cash flow increased from $200 million to $300 million per year in recent years to approximately $700 million in 2021 and $1 billion in 2022. retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities (including property operating costs and interest payments described below), less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures. we expect retained cash flow of approximately $500 million for 2023.
the reit distribution requirement limits cash flow from operations that can be retained and reinvested in the business, increasing our reliance upon raising capital to fund growth. capital needs in excess of retained cash flow are met with: (i) medium and long-term debt, (ii) preferred equity, and (iii) common equity. we select among these sources of capital based upon relative cost, availability, the desire for leverage, and considering potential constraints caused by certain features of capital sources, such as debt covenants. we view our line of credit, as well as any short-term bank loans, as bridge financing.
because raising capital is important to our growth, we endeavor to maintain a strong financial profile characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. we are one of the highest rated reits, as rated by major rating agencies moody's and standard & poor's. our senior notes payable have an "a" credit rating by standard & poor's and "a2" by moody's. our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are "a3" by moody's and "bbb+" by standard & poor's. our credit profile enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital.
we have a $500.0 million revolving line of credit that we are able to use as temporary "bridge" financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. as of december 31, 2022 and february 21, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit; however, we do have approximately $18.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, which limits our borrowing capacity to $481.4 million as of february 21, 2023. our line of credit matures on april 19, 2024.
we believe that we have significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, and we have significant access to sources of capital including debt and preferred equity. while the costs of financing have increased recently, based on our strong credit profile and our substantial current liquidity relative to our capital requirements noted below, we would not expect any potential capital market dislocations to have a material impact upon our expected capital and growth plans over the next 12 months. however, if capital market conditions were to change significantly in the long run, our access to or cost of debt and preferred equity capital could be negatively impacted and potentially affect future investment activities.
our current and expected capital resources include: (i) $775.3 million of cash as of december 31, 2022 and (ii) approximately $500.0 million of expected retained operating cash flow over the next twelve months. we believe that our cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing cash requirements for interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.
as described below, our current committed cash requirements consist of (i) $70.5 million in property acquisitions currently under contract and (ii) $606.6 million of remaining spending on our current development pipeline, which will be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. our cash requirements may increase over the next year as we add projects to our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. additional potential cash requirements could result from various activities including the redemption of outstanding preferred securities, repurchases of common stock, or merger and acquisition activities, as and to the extent we determine to engage in such activities.
over the long term, to the extent that our cash requirements exceed our capital resources, we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital including issuing common or preferred securities, issuing debt, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.
cash requirements the following summarizes our expected material cash requirements, which comprise (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest, (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid in accordance with reit distribution requirements, and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including acquisitions and developments and repurchases of our securities. we expect to satisfy these cash requirements through operating cash flow and opportunistic debt and equity financings.
required debt repayments: as of december 31, 2022, the principal outstanding on our debt totaled approximately $6.9 billion, consisting of $10.1 million of secured notes payable, $1.7 billion of euro-denominated unsecured notes payable and $5.3 billion of u.s. dollar denominated unsecured notes payable. approximate principal maturities and interest payments are as follows (amounts in thousands):
2023          $151,532
2024           933,385
2025           367,561
2026         1,251,404
2027           587,643
thereafter         4,349,115
$7,640,640
capital expenditure requirements: capital expenditures include general maintenance, major repairs, or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or redevelopment of existing facilities to increase their available rentable square footage.
capital expenditures totaled $452.3 million in 2022 and are expected to approximate $450 million in 2023. in addition to standard capital repairs of building elements reaching the end of their useful lives, our capital expenditures in recent years have included incremental expenditures to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors pursuant to a multi-year program. such investments include development of more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage and upgrades to the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. we spent approximately $189 million in 2022 and expect to spend $160 million in 2023 on this effort. in addition, we have made investments in led lighting and the installation of solar panels, which approximated $56 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 and we expect to spend $132 million in 2023.
we believe that these incremental investments improve customer satisfaction, the attractiveness and competitiveness of our facilities to new and existing customers and, in the case of led lighting and solar panels, reduce operating costs.
requirement to pay distributions: for all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a reit, as defined in the code. for each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a reit, we will not be subject to u.s. federal corporate income tax on our "reit taxable income" (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. we believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to qualify as a reit.
on february 4, 2023, our board declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share totaling approximately $526 million, which will be paid at the end of march 2023. our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute our taxable income. future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash flows from operating activities. our future aggregate annual common dividend distributions may increase as a result of the issuance of additional common shares, including any shares that would be issued if we were to consummate our recently proposed acquisition of life storage.
the annual distribution requirement with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at december 31, 2022 is approximately $194.7 million per year.
real estate investment activities: we continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties. subsequent to december 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities for a total purchase price of $70.5 million.
we are actively seeking to acquire additional facilities. however, future acquisition volume will depend upon whether additional owners will be motivated to market their facilities, which will in turn depend upon factors such as economic conditions and the level of seller confidence.
as of december 31, 2022, we had development and expansion projects at a total cost of approximately $979.6 million. costs incurred through december 31, 2022 were $373.0 million, with the remaining cost to complete of $606.6 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. some of these projects are subject to contingencies such as entitlement approval. we expect to continue to seek to add projects to maintain and increase our robust pipeline. our ability to do so continues to be challenged by various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage facilities in certain municipalities.
property operating expenses: the direct and indirect cost of our operations impose significant cash requirements. direct operating costs include property taxes, on-site property manager payroll, repairs and maintenance, utilities, and marketing. indirect operating costs include supervisory payroll and centralized management costs. the cash requirements from these operating costs will vary year to year based on, among other things, changes in the size of our portfolio and changes in property tax rates and assessed values, wage rates, and marketing costs in our markets.
redemption of preferred securities: historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. in the future, we may also elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt. as of february 21, 2023, we have two series of preferred securities that are eligible for redemption, at our option and with 30 days' notice: our 5.150% series f preferred shares ($280.0 million) and our 5.050% series g preferred shares ($300.0 million). see note 9 to our december 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements for the redemption dates of all of our series of preferred shares. redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors, including the rate at which we could issue replacement preferred securities. none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.
repurchases of common shares: our board has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. during 2022, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. from the inception of the repurchase program through february 21, 2023, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.

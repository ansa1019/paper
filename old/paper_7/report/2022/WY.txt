management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2020, refer to this same section in our 2021 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 18, 2022.
weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k economic and market conditions affecting our operations our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the u.s. housing and repair and remodel segments, impacts from any future restrictions related to covid-19 or other viral or similar outbreak, inflation trends and interest rates. the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (osb) as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. our real estate, energy and natural resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the u.s., and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.
while underlying longer-term fundamentals remain favorable for construction of new housing in the u.s., home sales and building activity have slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2022 averaged 1.4 million units, a 3.2 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. single family starts averaged 0.9 million units, a 4.8 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. multi-family starts averaged 541 thousand units in fourth quarter 2022, which was a 0.6 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 605 thousand units for fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 4.4 percent from the prior quarter. over the medium to long-term, we expect continued strength in the u.s. housing construction market, supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and an aging housing stock.
repair and remodeling expenditures decreased by 0.8 percent from third quarter 2022 to fourth quarter 2022 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels. over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and a u.s. housing stock median age of 43 years.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand felt the effects of a slowing housing market and more uncertain economic environment over most of fourth quarter 2022. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $452/mbf and the osb composite averaged $360/msf in fourth quarter 2022. over the course of the fourth quarter, prices declined from $512/mbf to $380/mbf for lumber and from $402/msf to $288/msf for osb.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices fell by 7.4 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared with third quarter 2022 as reported by risi log lines based on weyerhaeuser's portfolio mix. overall, domestic prices in the west fell moderately, as mills felt the effects of lower lumber prices, partially offset by continued constraints in log supply. in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased by 1.2 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared to third quarter 2022 and 4.6 percent from fourth quarter 2021 as reported by timber mart-south, as mills are carrying higher inventories to mitigate log and haul capacity constraints.
currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. during fourth quarter 2022, end use demand softened in export markets, partially offset by continued disruptions in global log and lumber supply. in japan, total housing starts increased 0.8 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2021, while the key post and beam segment saw a 4.0 percent decrease. an increase in lumber imports from europe to japan placed downward pressure on market conditions. china demand was held back by zero covid-19 policies and general economic conditions, but constraints of supply sources from other countries, particularly russia, supported demand from u.s. producers.
interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy, and their influence on our capital management activities. actions by the u.s. federal reserve, the overall condition of the economy, and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of third quarter 2022 to 6.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. while mortgage rates fell over the quarter and from a high of over 7 percent in november, the rapid increase in mortgage rates since the end of 2021 has had a negative impact on home affordability and reduced demand for homebuying.
increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. the consumer price index increased 6.5 percent year over year in december 2022, primarily due to demand and supply for goods and services, fluctuations in labor markets, and monetary policy set by the u.s. federal reserve. while we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer.
the condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in december 2022 remained near historically low levels and was unchanged from the end of the third quarter.
weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k labor force participation has increased to 62.3 percent in december 2022, from 61.9 percent in december 2021, but this remains below pre-pandemic levels of over 63 percent.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.
in mid-september 2022, weyerhaeuser employee members of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union commenced a work stoppage affecting the company's operations in washington and oregon. the stoppage involved approximately 1,200 employees and affected four lumber mills in our wood products segment and a portion of our western timberlands operations. this event had a negative impact on our operations for the third and fourth quarter, including reductions in fee harvest volumes and sale volumes for western timberlands, as well as reductions in production volumes and sales volumes for our lumber business. on october 28, 2022, the company announced the successful resolution of the work stoppage and resumed operations.

comparing 2022 with 2021
net sales net sales decreased $17 million - less than 1 percent - primarily due to a $263 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes across most product lines and decreased realizations for structural lumber and oriented strand board.
this decrease was partially offset by a $222 million increase in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the western and southern regions.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $461 million - 8 percent - primarily due to increased freight and raw material costs within our wood products segment, as well as increased logging and hauling costs and increased third party log purchase costs within our timberlands segment.
operating income operating income decreased $563 million - 15 percent - primarily due to a $478 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above).
net earnings net earnings decreased $727 million - 28 percent - primarily due to:
   the $563 million decrease in operating income discussed above;
   a $276 million pretax charge ($207 million after-tax) related to the early extinguishment of debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt, net) and
   a $235 million increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs (refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans).
these decreases were partially offset by a $284 million decrease in income tax expense, as well as a $43 million decrease in interest expense (refer to income taxes and interest expense).

we are required to pay corporate income taxes on earnings of our trss, which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate & enr segments' earnings. our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our trss.
our provision for income taxes the last two years was:
   $425 million in 2022 and
      $709 million in 2021.
income tax expense decreased by $284 million compared to 2021 due to decreases in our pretax earnings and effective income tax rate. we recorded a $69 million tax benefit related to the premiums paid in connection with our early debt retirement and a $53 million tax benefit related to our noncash pension settlement charge during 2022.

      $3,159 million in 2021.
comparing 2022 with 2021
net cash from operations decreased by $327 million, primarily due to decreased cash inflows from our wood products segment.
this change was partially offset by a $43 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes, as well as a $32 million decrease in cash used for interest payments.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2022, we contributed a total of $24 million to our pension and post-employment plans, compared to a total of $59 million during 2021.

weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k line of credit in january 2020, we refinanced and extended our $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in january 2025. as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants.
our revolving credit agreement utilizes the london inter-bank offered rate (libor) as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings. we plan to transition our revolving credit facility to an alternate reference rate prior to the cessation of libor. we have included provisions in our revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from libor to a replacement benchmark rate.
our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
   a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and

   total shareholders' equity,
   excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
   minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
   total debt,
   plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2022, we had:
   total adjusted shareholders' equity of $11.0 billion and
   a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 31.5 percent.
when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $247 million and $479 million, respectively. see note 15: shareholders' interest for further information on accumulated other comprehensive loss.

      $51 million in 2021.
our average stock price was $35.67 and $36.06 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
   $1,617 million in 2022 and
        $884 million in 2021.
the increase in dividends paid is primarily due to the supplemental dividend of $1.1 billion paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on 2021 financial results, partially offset by the interim supplemental dividend of $375 million paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. on january 26, 2023, our board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.90 per share based on 2022 financial results. the dividend is payable on february 27, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february 15, 2023.

off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. note 8: related parties and note 11: line of credit contain our disclosures of:

   letters of credit and
   information regarding variable interest entities.
environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
   historical experience and
   assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
   discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;
   potential impairments of long-lived assets and
   contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2022 are:
               5.4 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 2.9 percent at december 31, 2021;
       5.4 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 2.6 percent at december 31, 2021;
        5.3 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.1 percent at december 31, 2021 and
   5.3 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 3.0 percent at december 31, 2021.
pension expenses for 2023 will be based on the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. pension plans and the canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
    $10 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
   $1 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
   it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
   the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
   historical experience,
   evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
   judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
   consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies for more information.
prospective accounting pronouncements a summary of prospective accounting pronouncements is in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
performance measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

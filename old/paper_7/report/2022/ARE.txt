execution of capital strategy
2022 capital strategy during 2022, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy, as described below.
maintained access to diverse sources of capital strategically important to our long-term capital structure
•generated significant net cash flows from operating activities
•in 2022, we funded approximately $460 million of our equity capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends.
•continued strategic value harvesting through real estate dispositions and partial interest sales
•in 2022, these sales generated $2.2 billion of capital for investment into our highly leased development and redevelopment projects and strategic acquisitions. in connection with these transactions, we recorded gains or consideration in excess of book value aggregating $1.2 billion.
•achieved significant growth in annualized adjusted ebitda of $215.7 million, or 13%, for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, which allowed us to:
•improve our net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda ratio to 5.1x, representing the lowest ratio in company history, for the three months ended december 31, 2022 annualized, and fund $1.2 billion of growth on a leverage-neutral basis; and
•take advantage of favorable capital market environment and opportunistically issue, on a leverage-neutral basis, unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $1.8 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.28% and an initial weighted-average term of 22.0 years.
•continued disciplined management of common equity issuances to support growth in ffo per share, as adjusted, and nav per share
•in 2022, the aforementioned internally generated capital enabled us to meet our capital requirements while prudently limiting the amount of equity issuances to 12.9 million shares of common stock sold under our forward equity sales agreements and atm common stock offering program for net proceeds of $2.5 billion.
maintained a strong and flexible balance sheet with lowest leverage in company history as of december 31, 2022

2023 capital strategy during 2023, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit profile, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. consistent with 2022, our capital strategy for 2023 includes the following elements:
•allocate capital to class a properties located in life science, agtech, and tech campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters.
•maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include net cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in adjusted ebitda, strategic value harvesting and asset recycling through real estate disposition and partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, and other capital.
•continue to improve our credit profile.
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth.
•prudently ladder debt maturities and manage short-term variable-rate debt.
•prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies.
•maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity.
the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a properties is expected to enable us to continue to debt fund a significant portion of our development and redevelopment projects on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to diverse sources of capital, including unsecured senior notes payable and secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and equity capital. for further information, refer to "projected results, sources of capital," and "uses of capital" within this item 7. our ability to meet our 2023 capital strategy objectives and expectations will depend in part on capital market conditions, real estate market conditions, and other factors beyond our control. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives and expectations. refer to our discussion of "forward-looking statements" under part i and "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.

climate change and sustainability we cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. however, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. for example, most of our properties are located along the east and west coasts of the u.s. and some of our properties are located in close proximity to shorelines. to the extent that climate change impacts weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, wild fires, droughts, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties, delays in construction and resulting increased construction costs, or in our inability to operate the buildings at all. climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, and by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. we continue to evaluate our asset base for potential exposure to the following climate-related risks: sea level rise and increases in heavy rain, flood, drought, extreme heat, and wildfire. as a part of alexandria's risk management program, we purchase property insurance to mitigate the risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters. however, our insurance may not adequately cover all of our potential losses. as a result, there can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.
board of directors and leadership oversight the audit committee of alexandria's board of directors oversees the management of the company's financial and other systemic risks, including those related to climate. at a management level, alexandria's sustainability committee, which comprises members of the executive management team and senior decision makers spanning the company's real estate development, asset management, risk, and sustainability teams, leads the development and execution of our approach to climate-related risk.
proactively managing and mitigating climate risk the resilience of our properties under a changing climate is paramount both for our business and our tenants' mission-critical research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts. we consider the potential impacts associated with climate change and extreme weather conditions in the acquisition, design, development, and operation of our buildings and campuses. our approach to climate readiness focuses on physical and transition risks and is aligned to guidelines issued by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures ("tcfd"), which we endorsed in 2018. to this end, we have initiated a process to assess potential physical risks as well as the pathways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. we are also preparing for the transition to a low-carbon economy and continue to advance our approach to sustainable design and operations to align with our tenants' strategic sustainability goals and anticipate evolving regulations.
as further detailed in the "monitoring and preparing for transition" section below, over the past few years, regulatory bodies in most of our regions have either passed or proposed legislation to limit the carbon footprint of buildings, require procurement of clean power, or eliminate natural gas from new construction projects. additionally, certain u.s. jurisdictions incorporated guidelines into their building codes to address the up-front impacts of building materials such as concrete. moreover, our tenant preferences for green, efficient, and healthy buildings continue to rise. as of december 31, 2022, 90% of alexandria's top 20 tenants (by annual rental revenue) have set net-zero carbon and/or carbon neutrality goals. as a result of our own sustainability mission compelling us to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate risk, as well as the changing regulatory environment and our tenants' expectations, we have implemented a comprehensive approach to assessing and mitigating physical risk to our properties as well as to preparing for the transition, as described below.
assessing and mitigating physical risk to our properties we consider two climate change scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050 when evaluating physical risk to our properties: (1) a business-as-usual scenario in which greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions continue to increase with time (representative concentration pathways ("rcp") 8.5); and (2) a mitigation scenario in which ghg emissions level off by the year 2050 and decline thereafter (rcp 4.5). to ensure a conservative evaluation of potential risk at the asset level, we use the rcp 8.5 scenario, which has greater climate hazard impacts than rcp 4.5. these climate change assessments covering both acute and chronic risks enable us to assess preparedness for climate-related risks across the real estate life cycle.
for our property acquisitions, our risk management and sustainability teams will conduct climate change evaluations and advise the transactions and asset management teams of any need for potential property upgrades, which are evaluated in our financial modeling and transactional decisions.
for our developments and redevelopments of new class a properties, we will evaluate the potential impact of sea level rise, storm surges in coastal or tidal locations, and changing temperatures out to the year 2050. as feasible, we will consider designs that accommodate potential expansion of cooling infrastructure to meet future building needs while providing flexibility and optimization of infrastructure funds for more immediate needs. in water-scarce areas, we will consider planting drought-resistant vegetation and equipping buildings to connect to a municipal recycled-water infrastructure where available and feasible. in areas prone to wildfire, we will work toward incorporating brush management practices into landscape design and including enhanced air filtration systems to support safe and healthy indoor air. for example, we have designed our development project at 15 necco street to account for a high-emissions climate scenario and incorporate a number of innovative measures, including the strategic placement of critical infrastructure and building systems to provide multiple layers of protection, elevate the first floor above predicted 2070 flood evaluation (as published by the city of boston), and install landscape and hardscape features to decrease surface water runoff and serve as barriers to potential flooding.
for our properties located in the areas prone to wildfires or flooding, we are evaluating the extent to which we have mitigations in place and which operational and physical improvements may be made. for example, resilience measures that may be implemented at some of our properties will include the following:
•in areas prone to fire, we will work toward incorporating brush management practices into landscape design; we will select less flammable vegetation species and position them in a reasonable distance from a property; we will construct building envelopes with fire-resistant materials; and will install hvac systems that are able to filter smoke particulates in the air in the event of fire.
•in areas prone to flooding, critical building mechanical equipment will be positioned on the roofs or significantly above the projected potential flood elevations; temporary flood barriers will be stored on-site to be deployed at building entrances prior to a flood event; property entrances or the first floor will be elevated above projected present-day and future flood elevations; backflow preventors on storm/sewer utilities that discharge from the building will be installed; and the building envelope will be waterproofed up to the projected flood elevation.
as a part of alexandria's risk management program, we maintain all-risk property insurance at the portfolio level to mitigate the risk of extreme weather events and natural disasters (including floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and wind events). however, our insurance may not adequately cover all of our potential losses. as a result, there can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.
we also maintain all-risk property insurance at the portfolio level to mitigate certain risks associated with natural catastrophes (floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and wind events); our insurance policies, however, may not completely cover all our potential losses.
monitoring and preparing for transition globally, public concern regarding climate change has continued to escalate. on november 20, 2022, the united nations ("un") held its annual climate summit, cop27, and as a result of the summit announced an agreement that reaffirmed the goal to limit the global temperature rise to the crucial temperature threshold of 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. the agreement also provided a loss and damage fund for countries most vulnerable to climate disasters. as of the date of this report, no decisions have been made on who should pay into the fund, where the funds will come from, and which countries will benefit, and it is unknown how or if the terms of the agreement will be carried out effectively or whether these funds will be sufficient to mitigate the effects of damages related to climate change over time.
in august 2021, the united nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a detailed report titled "climate change 2021: the physical science basis," which provides comprehensive evidence of the catastrophic impact of ghg emissions on climate change, including increases in severe and dangerous weather conditions. in the u.s., in june 2019, president biden identified climate change as one of his administration's top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the u.s. to eliminate net ghg pollution by the year 2050. in april 2021, president biden announced his plan to reduce the u.s. ghg emissions by at least 50% by the year 2030. these environmental goals earned a prominent place in president biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which was signed into law on november 15, 2021. also, in august 2022, u.s. congress signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira"), which directs nearly $400 billion for federal spending to be used toward reducing carbon emissions and funding clean energy over the next 10 years and is designed to encourage private investment in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing. it is yet unknown what impact, if any, the ira may have on us.

alexandria has implemented a comprehensive approach to responding to transition risk through the following strategies:
decarbonizing construction alexandria targets leed gold or platinum certification for new ground-up developments. through our sustainability goals for new developments, we deliver energy- and resource-efficient buildings that meet or exceed tenant, city, state, and federal requirements for energy and water efficiency, material sourcing, biodiversity, and alternative transportation.
we are also revolutionizing the design of our buildings through innovative low-carbon solutions and are pursuing more advanced certifications in zero energy from leed and the international living future institute ("ilfi") for two projects:
•at 325 binney street, on our alexandria center at one kendall square mega campus in our cambridge submarket, the building design harnesses geothermal energy and is expected to yield a 92% reduction in fossil fuel consumption. the project is targeting leed platinum core & shell and leed zero energy certifications.
•at 685 gateway boulevard, an amenities building on our alexandria technology center® - gateway mega campus in our south san francisco submarket, we are targeting zero energy certification through ilfi by leveraging design strategies such as building envelope optimization, high-performance features, and on-site energy generation.
with several jurisdictions shifting (or with plans to shift soon) from fossil fuels for heating and requiring all electric buildings as a strategy to reduce carbon emissions associated with building operations, we have proactively incorporated electrification into new building designs, with one project completed and three currently in progress. we also continue to explore further opportunities to heat and cool our buildings with alternative energy, such as geothermal and wastewater heat recovery.
embodied carbon from the building sector accounts for 11% of annual global ghg emissions, and alexandria is playing a leadership role in the industry's effort to measure and ultimately reduce carbon associated with the construction process. in 2019, alexandria became a sponsor and the first reit to use the carbon leadership forum's embodied carbon in construction calculator (ec3) tool. for new construction projects, we seek to procure products with environmental product declarations ("epds"), which document and verify information on product composition and environmental impact. using such epds, alexandria targets a 10% reduction in embodied carbon for new ground-up development projects.
investing in renewable energy alexandria anticipates a significant increase in the percentage of renewable electricity used by our properties beginning in 2024 as a result of a new large-scale solar power purchase agreement ("ppa") that we executed in our greater boston market. starting in 2024, the ppa is expected to supply the greater boston market with new renewable electricity with power produced by a solar farm that will be connected to the new england grid. with this contract in place, 53% of alexandria's total electricity consumption is expected to be renewable based on electric usage during 2021.
reducing the environmental footprint of buildings in operation our sustainability mission compels us toward industry-leading sustainability practices and performance that can help reduce operating expenses and result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value, and thus enable us to capture climate-related opportunities. our ongoing efforts to reduce consumption are driven by our commitment to operational excellence in sustainability, building efficiency, and service to our tenants. alexandria's 2025 sustainability goals for buildings in operation and new ground-up construction projects provide the framework, metrics, and targets that guide the company's focus on continuous, long-term improvement. for buildings in operation, we set goals to reduce carbon emissions, energy consumption, and potable water consumption and increase waste diversion by the year 2025.
(1)2025 environmental goal for alexandria's cumulative progress relative to a 2015 baseline on a like-for-like basis for buildings in operation that the company directly manages.
(2)2025 environmental goal for buildings in operation that alexandria indirectly and directly manages. in alignment with industry best practice, the company reports waste diversion annually; the 2025 goal is to achieve a waste diversion rate of at least 45% by 2025.
(3)progress toward 2025 goal.
as we look to the future, we are creating our long-term strategy and plan for the net zero-carbon transition. we are developing an approach to set industry-leading science-based targets that will provide a pathway to reduce ghg emissions and continue our leadership in sustainability.

income from rentals total income from rentals for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $467.8 million, or 22.2%, to $2.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, as a result of increase in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.
rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $331.5 million, or 20.5%, to $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our non-same properties related to 3.9 million rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2021 and 99 operating properties aggregating 9.6 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2021.
rental revenues from our same properties for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $96.1 million, or 7.5%, to $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2021 and an increase in occupancy from our same properties to 95.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022 from 94.7% for the year ended december 31, 2021.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $136.3 million, or 27.8%, to $625.9 million, compared to $489.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was partially from our non-same properties related to our development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to january 1, 2021, as discussed above under "rental revenues."
same properties tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $70.9 million, or 17.4%, primarily due to higher operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2022, as discussed under "rental operations" below. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 93% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
other income other income for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $7.0 million, or 119.0%, to $12.9 million, compared to $5.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in other income was primarily due to an increase in fees for construction management services provided to tenants and an increase in interest income resulting from larger average deposits in, and higher interest rates earned by, our money market accounts during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021.
rental operations total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $159.6 million, or 25.6%, to $783.2 million, compared to $623.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was partially due to incremental expenses related to our non-same properties, which consist of development and redevelopment projects placed into service and acquired properties, as discussed above under "rental revenues."
same properties rental operating expenses increased by $86.1 million, or 18.1%, to $561.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $475.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily the result of increases in (i) utilities expenses aggregating $21.4 million, primarily due to increased electricity usage and rates; (ii) property tax expenses aggregating $16.4 million, primarily related to changes in the ownership of four of our consolidated real estate joint ventures located in our mission bay submarket during the three months ended december 31, 2021 and resulting tax reassessment of values of the properties held by these joint ventures; and (iii) higher contract services costs aggregating $12.7 million, primarily due to increases in security services and trash and janitorial service consumption and rates.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $25.8 million, or 17.0%, to $177.3 million, compared to $151.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately $7.2 million of the increase was the result of the acceleration of stock compensation expense recognized in connection with the resignation of stephen a. richardson, our former co-chief executive officer, which became effective on july 31, 2022. the remaining increase was primarily due to the costs related to corporate related costs, additional headcount, and corporate responsibility efforts, as well as the continued growth in the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired, as discussed above under "rental revenues." as a percentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were 9.8% and 10.2%, respectively.

we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of dividends, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, and issuances of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we also expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
for additional information on our liquidity requirements related to our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to note 5 - "leases" and note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions.
•improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital.
•maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, non-real estate investment sales, and common stock.
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth.
•maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities.
•maintain solid credit metrics.
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity.
•prudently manage variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate debt.
•maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility.
•fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities.
•manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross real estate assets.
•maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $284.1 million to $1.3 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily attributable to the following since january 1, 2021: (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space.

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to a decreased use of cash for purchases of real estate and increase in proceeds from dispositions of real estate, partially offset by increased cash used for additions to real estate. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.

capital resources we expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ending december 31, 2023 will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. there can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.

(1)refer to note 15 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional details. during the three months ended december 31, 2022, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating $104.7 million to sell 699,274 shares under our atm program at an average price of $149.68 per share (before underwriter discounts). we expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2023 and establish a new atm program during the first quarter of 2023.
the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as "forward-looking statements" under part i; "item 1a. risk factors"; and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast of key sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $350.0 million to $400.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending december 31, 2023. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. for the year ending december 31, 2023, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be delivered, and contributions from same properties and recently acquired properties to contribute significant increases in income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. we anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $57 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. refer to "cash flows" within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2022.
debt we expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2023 from real estate dispositions, sales of partial interests, strategic real estate joint ventures, settlement of our outstanding forward equity sales agreements, cash on hand, issuances under our commercial paper program, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and borrowings under our secured construction loans.
in september 2022, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit to extend the maturity date to january 22, 2028 from january 6, 2026, increase the commitments to $4.0 billion from $3.0 billion, and convert the interest rate to sofr plus 0.875% from libor plus 0.815%. as of december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. based upon our ability to achieve certain annual sustainability targets, the interest rate and facility fee rate are also subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to four basis points with respect to the interest rate and up to one basis point with respect to the facility fee.
in september 2022, we increased the aggregate amount we may issue from time to time under our commercial paper program to $2.0 billion from $1.5 billion. commercial notes under our commercial paper program can have a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance and are generally issued with a maturity of 30 days or less. our commercial paper program is backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance under our commercial paper program. we use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. the notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. they are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance. in the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the unsecured senior line of credit at sofr plus 0.875%. the commercial paper notes sold during the year ended december 31, 2022 were issued at a weighted-average yield to maturity of 1.91%. as of december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under our commercial paper program.
in february 2022, we issued $1.8 billion of unsecured senior notes payable with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.28% and a weighted-average maturity of 22.0 years. the unsecured senior notes consisted of $800.0 million of 2.95% green unsecured senior notes due 2034 and $1.0 billion of 3.55% unsecured senior notes due 2052.
in april 2022, we repaid two secured notes payable aggregating $195.0 million due in 2024 with an effective interest rate of 3.40% and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million, including a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

proactive management of transition from libor libor has been used extensively in the u.s. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. however, based on an announcement made by the financial conduct authority on march 5, 2021, one-week and two-month libor rates ceased to be published after december 31, 2021; all other libor settings will effectively cease after june 30, 2023, and it is expected that libor will no longer be used after this date. in connection with this change, in the u.s. the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") was established to help ensure the successful transition from libor. in june 2017, the arrc selected sofr, a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by u.s. treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for u.s. dollar libor. we have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition from libor and have implemented numerous proactive measures to eliminate the potential transition-related impacts to the company, specifically:
•since january 2017, we have proactively eliminated outstanding libor-based borrowings, and as of december 31, 2022, we had no libor-based debt or financial contracts, including through our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
•from 2020 through december 31, 2022, we increased the aggregate amount available under our commercial paper program to $2.0 billion from $750.0 million. our commercial paper program is not subject to libor and is used for funding short-term working capital needs. this program provides us with the ability to issue commercial paper notes bearing interest at short-term fixed rates with a maturity of generally 30 days or less and a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. as of december 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper notes outstanding.
•in september 2022, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit to convert its interest rate to sofr, among other changes. as of december 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 and "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about our management of risks related to the transition from libor.
real estate dispositions, sales of partial interests, and issuances of common equity we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed opportunistic acquisitions and our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects, and also provide significant capital for growth. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a properties and/or development projects. for 2023, we expect real estate dispositions, sales of partial interests, and issuances of common equity ranging from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of adjusted ebitda associated with the assets sold.
refer to note 3 - "investment in real estate", note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures", and note 15 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 and "dispositions and sales of partial interests" under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our dispositions, sales of partial interests, and issuances of common equity.
as a reit, we are generally subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the irs characterizes as "prohibited transactions." we do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. however, unless we meet certain "safe harbor" requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances of the sale. our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about the "prohibited transaction" tax.
common equity transactions during the year ended december 31, 2022, our common equity transactions included the following:
•in january 2022, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.7 billion to sell 8.1 million shares of our common stock (including the exercise of an underwriters' option) at a public offering price of $210.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions.
•during the year ended december 31, 2022, we settled all of our outstanding forward equity sales agreements by issuing 8.1 million shares and received net proceeds of $1.6 billion.
•in december 2021, we entered into a new atm common stock offering program, which allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of our common stock.
•during the year ended december 31, 2022, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating $858.1 million to sell 4.9 million shares under our atm program at an average price of $175.12 per share (before underwriting discounts).
•during the three months ended december 31, 2022, we settled a portion of our outstanding forward equity agreements by issuing 4.2 million shares and received net proceeds of $737.4 million.
•we expect to settle the remaining outstanding forward equity agreements by issuing 699,274 shares and receive net proceeds of approximately $102.4 million in 2023.
•as of december 31, 2022, the remaining aggregate amount available under our atm program for future sales of common stock was $141.9 million. we expect to establish a new atm program during the first quarter of 2023.
other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may issue common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
additionally, we, together with joint venture partners, hold interests in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. these existing joint ventures provide significant equity capital to fund a portion of our future construction spend, and our joint venture partners may also contribute equity into these entities for financing-related activities. over the next four years, we expect to receive $1.4 billion from our existing real estate joint venture partners to fund construction projects. for 2023, we expect contributions from noncontrolling interests to aggregate $794.0 million, approximately 55% of which represents funding commitments from our existing real estate joint ventures and the remaining amount of which represents funding expected from our future real estate joint ventures. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we received $1.5 billion of contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests.
uses of capital summary of capital expenditures one of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our value-creation pipeline aggregating 5.6 million rsf of class a properties undergoing construction, 9.9 million rsf of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 17.3 million sf of future development projects in north america. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to "new class a development and redevelopment properties: current projects" under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 of $278.6 million and $170.6 million, respectively, was classified in investments in real estate in our consolidated balance sheets.
property taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, aggregating $83.8 million and $69.8 million, and property taxes, insurance on real estate and indirect project costs aggregating $97.3 million and $73.8 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the increase in capitalized costs for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities in 2022 over 2021. pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $36.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022.
we use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. we are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $186.7 million. costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.
acquisitions refer to the "acquisitions" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" and to note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k, and the "acquisitions" section in "item 2. properties" in this annual report on form 10-k for information on our acquisitions.
dividends during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we paid common stock dividends of $757.7 million and $656.0 million, respectively. the increase of $101.8 million in dividends paid on our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in the number of common shares outstanding subsequent to january 1, 2021 as a result of issuances of common stock under our atm program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $4.66 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2022 from $4.42 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2021.
secured notes payable secured notes payable as of december 31, 2022 consisted of three notes secured by two properties. our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.75%. as of december 31, 2022, the total book value of our investments in real estate securing debt was approximately $216.8 million. as of december 31, 2022, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, comprised approximately $649 thousand and $58.4 million of fixed-rate debt and unhedged variable-rate debt, respectively.

(1)all covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the respective debt agreements.
(2)the calculation of consolidated ebitda is based on the definitions contained in our loan agreements and is not directly comparable to the computation of ebitda as described in exchange act release no. 47226.
in addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the company, alexandria real estate equities, l.p., and the company's subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the company's assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.

(1)all covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the credit agreement.
estimated interest payments estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. as of december 31, 2022, 99.4% of our debt was fixed-rate debt. for additional information regarding our debt, refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
ground lease obligations operating lease agreements ground lease obligations as of december 31, 2022, included leases for 40 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 9% of our total number of properties. excluding one ground lease that expires in 2036 related to one operating property with a net book value of $6.3 million as of december 31, 2022, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 31 to 99 years, including available extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.
as of december 31, 2022, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the lessee aggregated $870.1 million and $34.1 million, respectively. we are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under operating lease arrangements in which we are the lessee. the operating lease liability is measured based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. the right-of-use asset is equal to the corresponding operating lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. as of december 31, 2022, the present value of the remaining contractual payments, aggregating $904.2 million, under our operating lease agreements, including our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was $406.7 million, which was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately 42 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 4.6%. our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated $558.3 million. we classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. refer to the "lease accounting" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
commitments as of december 31, 2022, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $3.5 billion. in addition, we may be required to incur construction costs associated with our future development projects aggregating 643,331 rsf in our greater boston market pursuant to an agreement whereby our counterparty may elect to execute future lease agreements on mutually agreeable terms.
we expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. we may have the ability to cease the construction of certain projects, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. in addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $22.4 million primarily related to construction projects and an anticipated acquisition.
we are committed to funding approximately $415.4 million related to our non-real estate investments. these funding commitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report nav and expire at various dates over the next 12 years, with a weighted-average expiration of 8.6 years as of december 31, 2022.
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed. in addition, we carry pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

inflation as of december 31, 2022, approximately 93% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 96% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. a period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured senior notes payable, and borrowings under our secured construction loans, and secured loans held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
in addition, refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion about risks that inflation directly or indirectly may pose to our business.

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.
our critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with gaap, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k. our critical accounting estimates are described below.
recognition of real estate acquired generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). the accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values.
we assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on:
(i)available comparable market information;
(ii)estimated replacement costs; or
(iii)discounted cash flow analysis/estimated net operating income and capitalization rates.
in certain instances, we may use multiple valuation techniques and estimate fair values based on an average of multiple valuation results. we exercise judgement to determine key assumptions used in each valuation technique. for example, to estimate future cash flows in the discounted cash flow analysis, we are required to use judgment and make a number of assumptions, including those related to projected growth in rental rates and operating expenses, and anticipated trends and market/economic conditions. the use of different assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis can affect the amount of consideration allocated to the acquired depreciable/amortizable asset, which in turn can impact our net income due to the recognition of the related depreciation/amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we completed acquisitions of 42 properties for a total purchase price of $2.8 billion during the year ended december 31, 2022. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. refer to the "investments in real estate" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
impairment of long-lived assets impairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale a property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. these criteria are described in the "investments in real estate" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k. upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. the determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. we develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. if this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. these estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. we review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset's fair value less cost to sell. conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.
impairment of other long-lived assets for each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. we may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
the evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
impairment of real estate joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting we generally account for our investments in real estate joint ventures that do not meet the consolidation criteria under the equity method. under the equity method of accounting, we initially recognize our investment at cost and subsequently adjust the carrying amount of the investment for our share of the investee's earnings or losses, distributions received, and other-than-temporary impairments.
our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the decrease in the carrying amount of our investment has occurred and is other than temporary. triggering events or impairment indicators for an unconsolidated joint venture include its recurring operating losses, and other events such as occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, significant changes in construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other factors related to the properties owned by the real estate joint venture, or a decision by investors to cease providing support or reduce their financial commitment to the joint venture.
upon determination that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount of our investment to its estimated fair value. as of december 31, 2022, the carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures aggregated $38.4 million, or approximately 0.1% of our total assets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, no other-than-temporary impairments related to our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures were identified. refer to the "unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" section in note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
impairment of non-real estate investments we hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, agtech, and technology industries. as a reit, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.
our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share require our evaluation for impairment when changes in these entities' conditions may indicate that an impairment exists. we closely monitor these investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. we evaluate these investees on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, (iv) significant concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern, or (v) a decision by investors to cease providing support to reduce their financial commitment to the investee. if such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment's fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment's carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value. as of each december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share accounted for approximately 2% of our total assets and aggregated $582.7 million, $491.3 million, and $389.2 million, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized impairment charges aggregating 4%, 0%, and 6% of the carrying amounts of our investments in privately held entities that do not report nav, respectively.
monitoring of tenant credit quality we monitor, on an ongoing basis, the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses and industries in which they conduct business, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.
we have a team of employees who, among them, have an extensive educational background or experience in biology, chemistry, industrial biotechnology, agtech, and the life science industry, as well as knowledge in finance. this team is responsible for timely assessment, monitoring, and communication of our tenants' credit quality and any material changes therein. during the fiscal years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, specific write-offs and a general allowance related to deferred rent balances of tenants recognized in our consolidated statements of operations have not exceeded 0.8% of our income from rentals for each respective year. for additional information, refer to the "monitoring of tenant credit quality" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
allowance for credit losses for the financial assets in scope of the accounting standard on credit losses, we are required to estimate and recognize lifetime expected losses, rather than incurred losses, which results in the earlier recognition of credit losses even if the expected risk of credit loss is remote.
as of december 31, 2022, all of our 432 properties were subject to the operating lease agreements, which are excluded from the scope of the standard on credit losses. as of december 31, 2022, we had one direct financing lease agreement for a parking structure with an aggregate net investment balance of $39.4 million, which represented approximately 0.1% of our total assets. at each reporting date, we estimate the current credit loss related to these assets by assessing the probability of default on these leases based on the lessees' financial condition, credit rating, business prospects, remaining lease term, and, in the case of the direct financing lease, the expected value of the underlying collateral upon its repossession, and, if necessary, we recognize a credit loss adjustment. since our adoption of this standard on january 1, 2020, and as of each december 31, 2022 and 2021, our allowance for credit losses has not exceeded $2.8 million, or 0.01% of our total assets. for further details, refer to the "allowance for credit losses" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" and to note 5 - "leases" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
non-gaap measures and definitions this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
the 2018 white paper published by the nareit board of governors (the "nareit white paper") defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignation of an executive officer, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. we compute the amount that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards using the two-class method. under the two-class method, we allocate net income (after amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests) to common stockholders and to unvested restricted stock awards by applying the respective weighted-average shares outstanding during each quarter-to-date and year-to-date period. this may result in a difference of the summation of the quarter-to-date and year-to-date amounts. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.
the following table reconciles net income to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2022 (in thousands):

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. adjusted ebitda also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains or losses and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. these non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of total revenues.
we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. for example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
in addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. adjusted ebitda has limitations as a measure of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.
in order to calculate the adjusted ebitda margin, we divide adjusted ebitda by total revenues as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. we believe that this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional useful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities.
the following table reconciles net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to adjusted ebitda and calculates the adjusted ebitda margin for the three months and years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with gaap, for leases in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf. annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue from our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. annual rental revenue per rsf is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the rsf of our consolidated properties and our share of the rsf of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 93% of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
capitalization rates capitalization rates are calculated based on net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or near-term prospective net operating income.
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). refer to the definition of "fixed-charge coverage ratio" in this section within this item 7 in this annual report on 10-k for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.
class a properties and aaa locations class a properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
construction costs related to active development and redevelopment projects under contract includes (i) costs incurred to date, (ii) remaining costs to complete under a general contractor's guaranteed maximum price ("gmp") construction contract or other fixed contracts, and (iii) our maximum committed tenant improvement allowances under our executed leases. the general contractor's gmp contract or other fixed contracts reduce our exposure to costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers, unless the overruns result from, among other things, a force majeure event or a change in the scope of work covered by the contract.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction a key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new class a properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, agtech, and technology campuses in aaa innovation clusters. these projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, agtech, or tech office space. we generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new class a office/laboratory, agtech, and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality class a properties.
pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) amounts to bring certain acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of acquisition) and (ii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready office/laboratory space to foster the growth of promising early- and growth-stage life science companies.
revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from class b to class a.
non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.
dividend payout ratio (common stock)
dividend payout ratio (common stock) is the ratio of the absolute dollar amount of dividends on our common stock (shares of common stock outstanding on the respective record dates multiplied by the related dividend per share) to funds from operations attributable to alexandria's common stockholders - diluted, as adjusted.
dividend yield dividend yield for the quarter represents the annualized quarter dividend divided by the closing common stock price at the end of the quarter.
fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. we believe that this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).
the following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest and fixed charges and computes the fixed-charge coverage ratio for the three months and years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):

initial stabilized yield (unlevered)
initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, as reported by bloomberg professional services. credit ratings from moody's investors service and s&p global ratings reflect credit ratings of the tenant's parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant's parent entity will satisfy the tenant's lease obligation upon such tenant's default. we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. material changes that cause a tenant's market capitalization to decrease below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

joint venture financial information we present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. for each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe that this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with gaap.

net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. refer to the definition of "adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin" within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.
furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. we also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute the number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. for operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of "annual rental revenue" in this "non-gaap measures and definitions" section.
same property comparisons as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. we separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the sec in our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. these same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. refer to "same properties" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.
we classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenues in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in "comparison of results for the year ended december 31, 2022 to the year ended december 31, 2021" in the "results of operations" section within this item 7 because we believe it promotes investors' understanding of our operating results. we believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.
the following table reconciles income from rentals to tenant recoveries for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands):

unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general company overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, please see "information regarding non-gaap financial measures" below regarding important information on non-gaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis.
we are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach, florida. as an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds' underlying "insurable exposure units," which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales or payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. we also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the "captives") for the purpose of having additional capacity to place coverage, drive additional revenues and to participate in underwriting. the company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. these captives give us another way to deliver incremental revenue growth and continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. the captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. the captives limit the company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by only participating in certain tranches of the underwriting.
we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2022, with the exception of 2009, when our revenues declined 1.0%. our revenues grew from $95.6 million in 1993 to $3.6 billion in 2022, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 13.3%. in the same 29-year period, we increased net income from $8.1 million to $671.8 million in 2022, a 16.5% compound annual growth rate.
the volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, changes in general economic and competitive conditions, a health pandemic or a reduction of purchased limits the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues. for example, higher levels of inflation, an increase the value of insurable exposure units, or a general decline in economic activity, could decrease the value of insurable exposure units. conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. historically, we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on net new business and acquisitions. we foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results.
the term "core commissions and fees" excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. the net change in core commissions and fees reflects the aggregate changes attributable to: (i) net new and lost accounts; (ii) net changes in our customers' exposure units; (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers; and (v) any businesses acquired or disposed of.
we also earn profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but in select situations may reflect additional considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. these commissions, which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income, are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s). over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.0% of commissions and fees revenue.
fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers, and to a lesser extent as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. fee revenues are generated by: (i) our services segment, which is primarily a fee-based business that provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers' compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as medicare set-aside services, social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services; (ii) our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies; and (iii) our retail segment in our large-account customer base, where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers, and in our automobile dealer services ("f&i") businesses where we earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs. fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 25.8% in 2022 and 27.4% in 2021.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, our commissions and fees growth rate was 16.9% and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 8.1%.
historically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted, on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. our policy as it relates to the company's capital is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term money-market funds and fixed income investment securities. investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other revenues.
income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased by $113.3 million, or 14.9% over 2021, driven by new business and growth from existing customers, acquisitions we completed in the last twelve months and the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, which were partially offset by incremental operating costs, increased amortization expense as a result of our recent acquisitions along with increased interest expense associated with higher average debt balances from debt issued and bank financing in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the acquisitions of grp (jersey) holdco limited and its businesses ("grp"), orchid underwriters agency and crosscover insurance services ("orchid") and bdb limited companies ("bdb") as well as increases in the floating-rate benchmark used on our adjustable rate debt and the net change in any gain or loss associated with the sales of businesses or books of business.
information regarding non-gaap financial measures in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), we provide references to the following non-gaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of the sec rules: total revenues - adjusted, organic revenue, ebitdac, ebitdac margin, ebitdac - adjusted and ebitdac margin - adjusted. we present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe it provides additional meaningful methods to evaluate the company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability and that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance. this non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the company's consolidated income statements as of the relevant date. consistent with regulation g, a description of such information is provided below and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-gaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10-k under "results of operations - segment information."
we view organic revenue and organic revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our four segments, because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year. we also view total revenues - adjusted, ebitdac, ebitdac - adjusted, ebitdac margin and ebitdac margin - adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. as disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use organic revenue and ebitdac margin as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees.
beginning january 1, 2022, we include guaranteed supplemental commissions ("gscs") as part of core commissions and fees and, therefore, gscs are a component of organic revenue. all current and prior periods contained within this annual report on form 10-k have been adjusted for this treatment. gscs are a stable source of revenue that are highly correlated to core commissions, so isolating them separately provided no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our revenue.
beginning january 1, 2022, the following, in addition to the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, are excluded from certain non-gaap measures, as we believe these amounts are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the business and are not easily comparable from period-to-period:
•"(gain)/loss on disposal," a caption on our consolidated statements of income which reflects net proceeds received as compared to net book value related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure.
•"acquisition/integration costs," which represent the acquisition and integration costs (e.g., costs associated with regulatory filings, legal/accounting services, due diligence and the costs of integrating our information technology systems) arising out of our acquisitions of grp, orchid and bdb, which are not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future.
•the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation ("foreign currency translation"), which is calculated by applying current-year foreign exchange rates to the various functional currencies in our business to our reporting currency of u.s. dollars for the same period in the prior year.
we are presenting ebitdac - adjusted and ebitdac margin - adjusted for the current and prior year periods contained within this annual report on form 10-k so these non-gaap financial measures compare both periods on the same basis.
non-gaap revenue measures
•total revenues - adjusted is our total revenues, excluding the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation.
•organic revenue is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period); and (iii) the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation. the term "core commissions and fees" excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific fee-based services rendered. organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth.
non-gaap earnings measures
•ebitdac is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
•ebitdac margin is defined as ebitdac divided by total revenues.
•ebitdac - adjusted is defined as ebitdac, excluding (i) (gain)/loss on disposal, (ii) acquisition/integration costs and (iii) the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation.
•ebitdac margin - adjusted is defined as ebitdac - adjusted divided by total revenues - adjusted.
our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments and, therefore, comparability may be limited. this supplemental non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the company's consolidated financial statements.
acquisitions part of our business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations. from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired 610 insurance intermediary operations.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, which are based upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues, expenses, carrying values of our assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. in particular, the accounting for these areas is subject to uncertainty because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers, acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk, and conversely, acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums. in the majority of these arrangements, our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy, as such, that is when the associated revenue is recognized. in some arrangements, where we are compensated through commissions, we also perform other services for our customer beyond binding of coverage. in those arrangements we apportion the commission between binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied. where the company's performance obligations have been completed, but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors, we estimate the amount of such compensation. we refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement, whichever occurs first.
to a lesser extent, the company earns revenues in the form of fees. like commissions, fees paid to us in lieu of commission, are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy. when we are paid a fee for service, however, the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work, which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty, and employee benefits practices. other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreed-upon services to the customer.
to a much lesser extent, the company earned revenues starting in 2022 in the form of net retained earned premiums in connection with the captives. these premiums are reported net of the ceded premiums for reinsurance and recognized evenly over the associated policy periods.
management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances.
please see note 2 "revenues" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues.
business combinations and purchase price allocations we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts, non-compete agreements, and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges.
in connection with acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements. purchased customer accounts include the right to represent insureds or claimants supported by the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies, customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services. their value primarily represents the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future duration of the acquired customer relationships. the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency, expenses and discount rates. any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts. non-compete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements. purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which typically range from 3 to 15 years. the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized.
the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions, where an earn-out is part of the negotiated transaction. subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as a result of updated expectations for the performance of the associated business.
the fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, the acquired business's future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business, and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. the expected future payments are estimated based on the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earn-out payments will be made.
intangible assets impairment goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, measured by a fair-value-based test. amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. the company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if the company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is not determined that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying amount, the company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit for comparison against the carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. fair value is estimated based upon multiples of ebitdac, or on a discounted cash flow basis.
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. any of the following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) a significant negative industry or economic trend, and (iii) a significant decline in our market capitalization. if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-referenced factors, an impairment analysis is performed. management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to revise the assessment and, if appropriate, record an impairment charge. we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30, 2022 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. additionally, there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
non-cash stock-based compensation we grant non-vested stock awards to our employees, with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards, subject to any performance modification. during the performance measurement period, we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and adjust the expense recognition accruals with the expected performance outcome.
during the first quarter of 2021, the performance conditions for approximately 1.2 million shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2010 sip and approximately 22,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2018 and 2020. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2020. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2018 grant date and four years from the 2020 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
during the first quarter of 2022, the performance conditions for approximately 1.3 million shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2010 sip and approximately 22,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2019 and 2021. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2021. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2019 grant date and four years from the 2021 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
during the first quarter of 2023, the performance conditions for approximately 970,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the under the company's 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2020 and 2022. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2022. the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2020 grant date and four years from the 2022 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share.
litigation and claims we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable, an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred. management, with the assistance of in-house and outside counsel, determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues. new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income.
results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure commissions and fees commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2022, increased $515.7 million to $3,563.2 million, or 16.9% over 2021. core commissions and fees in 2022 increased $509.2 million, composed of (i) $239.9 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 8.1%; (ii) $288.6 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; (iii) an offsetting decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation of $4.5 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $14.8 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months. profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2022 increased by $6.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to the same period in 2021. this increase was the result of recent acquisitions and qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2022 that we did not qualify for in the prior year, partially offset by reduced profit-sharing contingent commissions relating to the impacts from the estimated insured property losses associated with hurricane ian.
investment income investment income for 2022 was $6.5 million, compared with $1.1 million in 2021. the increase was primarily driven by higher average interest rates compared to 2021.
other income, net other income for 2022 was $3.7 million, compared with $2.8 million in 2021.
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 50.8% for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 53.6% for the year ended december 31, 2021, and increased 11.0%, or $180.0 million. this increase included $128.6 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2021. therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2022 and 2021 increased by $51.4 million or 3.2%. this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) increased claims associated with our self-insured employee health plan; (ii) an increase in salaries attributable to inflation; (iii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; partially offset by (iv) the year-over-year decrease of approximately $36.6 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our employees' investment elections associated with our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities that closely match the investment elections of our employees.
other operating expenses other operating expenses represented 16.7% of total revenues for 2022 as compared to 13.2% for the year ended december 31, 2021. other operating expenses for 2022 increased $193.8 million, or 48.1%, from the same period of 2021. the net increase included: (i) $73.7 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2021; (ii) increased variable costs with travel and entertainment being the largest driver; (iii) acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisitions of orchid, grp, and bdb, and; (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately $36.6 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits as noted above.
gain or loss on disposal the company recognized net gains on disposals of $4.5 million in 2022 and $9.6 million in 2021. the gains on disposal were due to activity associated with sales of businesses or book of business. although we do not routinely sell businesses or customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth, or because doing so is in the company's best interest.
amortization amortization expense for 2022 increased $27.0 million to $146.6 million, or 22.6% over 2021. this increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past twelve months, partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
depreciation depreciation expense for 2022 increased $5.9 million to $39.2 million, or 17.7% over 2021. changes in depreciation expense reflect the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives, net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past twelve months, partially offset by fixed assets which became fully depreciated.
interest expense interest expense for 2022 increased $76.2 million to $141.2 million, or 117.2%, from 2021. the increase is due to higher average debt balances resulting from debt issuance and bank financing in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the acquisitions of orchid, grp, and bdb, as well as increases in the floating rate benchmark used on our adjustable-rate debt.
change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805-business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. the recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated. estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years.
the net charge or credit to the consolidated statements of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables balance, and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
as of december 31, 2022, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (level 3) as defined in asc 820-fair value measurement. the resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

results of operations - segment information as discussed in note 16 "segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we operate four reportable segments: retail, national programs, wholesale brokerage and services. on a segmented basis, changes in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions. likewise, other revenues in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income. as such, in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment, management focuses on the organic revenue growth rate and ebitdac margin.

(2)a non-gaap financial measure nmf = not a meaningful figure the retail segment's total revenues in 2022 increased 17.9%, or $316.4 million, over 2021, to $2,084.3 million. the $305.1 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) $111.6 million related to net new and renewal business; (ii) approximately $205.1 million related to the core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; (iii) an offsetting decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation of $3.9 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $7.2 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2021 from businesses since divested. profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2022 increased 25.4%, or $9.9 million, over 2021, to $48.8. the retail segment's growth rate for total commissions and fees was 17.8% and the organic revenue growth rate was 6.5% for 2022. the organic revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding twelve months and growth on renewals of existing customers. renewal business was impacted by rate increases in most lines of business with continued increases in employee benefits, commercial and condominium property, partially offset by continued premium rate reductions in workers' compensation.
income before income taxes for 2022 increased 39.6%, or $132.3 million, over the same period in 2021, to $466.7 million. the primary factors driving this increase were: (i) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) the drivers of ebitdac described below; (iii) amortization and depreciation growing faster than total revenues; and (iv) a decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
ebitdac - adjusted for 2022 increased 17.1%, or $93.9 million, from the same period in 2022, to $643.4 million. ebitdac margin - adjusted for 2022 decreased to 30.9% from 31.2% in the same period in 2021. ebitdac margin was impacted by increased variable operating expenses, which are largely travel and meeting related.
national programs segment the national programs segment manages over 40 programs supported by approximately 100 well-capitalized carrier partners. in most cases, the insurance carriers that support these programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. these programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and brown & brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. this segment also operates our write-your-own flood insurance carrier, wnfic and participates in two captives. wnfic's underwriting business consists of policies written under and fully ceded to the nfip and excess flood and private flood policies which are fully reinsured in the private market. the captives provide additional underwriting capacity and allow us to participate in underwriting results. the company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. these captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. the captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. the captives limit the company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by participating in limited tranches of the underwriting risk.
the national programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: professional programs, personal lines programs, commercial programs, public entity-related programs and specialty programs. approximately 76.1% of the national programs segment's commissions and fees revenue is commission based.

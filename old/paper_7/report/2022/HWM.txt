(dollars in millions, except share and per-share amounts)
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. the md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
overview our business howmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. howmet's innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets.
howmet is a global company operating in 20 countries. based upon the country where the point of shipment occurred, north america and europe generated 71% and 22%, respectively, of howmet's sales in 2022. in addition, howmet has operating activities in numerous countries and regions outside of north america and europe, including china and japan. governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in countries with such activities.
management review of 2022 and outlook the company derived approximately 46% of its revenue from products sold to the commercial aerospace market for the year ended december 31, 2022 which is substantially less than the pre-pandemic 2019 annual rate of approximately 60%. due to the global covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the commercial aerospace industry to date, there has been a decrease in domestic and international air travel, which in turn has adversely affected demand for narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. although domestic air travel now approximates pre-pandemic levels, china domestic air travel is still below pre-pandemic 2019 levels on an average monthly basis in 2022. international travel also continues to be lower than pre-pandemic 2019 levels. we expect commercial aerospace growth to continue, with narrow-body demand returning faster than wide-body demand. the commercial wide-body aircraft market is taking longer to recover, which is creating a shift in our product mix compared to pre-pandemic conditions. in addition to the impact from the pandemic, the timing and level of future aircraft builds by oems are subject to changes and uncertainties, such as declines in boeing 787 production rates due to delays in its recertification, which may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in product mix in certain segments.
in 2022, sales increased 14% over 2021 primarily as a result of higher sales in the commercial aerospace market, an increase in material cost pass through of $225, and favorable product pricing of $67, partially offset by lower sales in the defense aerospace market. price increases are in excess of material and inflationary cost pass through to our customers.
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 87% from 2021. total segment adjusted ebitda(1) increased 13% from 2021 due to favorable sales in the commercial aerospace market, cost reductions, and favorable product pricing, partially offset by boeing 787 production declines and lower sales in the defense aerospace market and inflationary costs.
management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through profitable revenue, efficient operations, and margin enhancement. management has also continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. management's focus and the related results enabled howmet to end 2022 with a solid financial position.
the following financial information reflects certain key highlights of howmet's 2022 results:
•sales of $5,663, an increase of 14% from 2021, with higher sales in the commercial aerospace market;
•net income from continuing operations of $469, or $1.11 per diluted share;
•income from continuing operations before income taxes of $606, an increase of $282, or 87%, from 2021;
•total segment adjusted ebitda(1) of $1,352, an increase of $152, or 13%, from 2021;
•cash on hand and restricted cash at the end of the year of $792;
•cash provided from operations of $733; cash used for financing activities of $526; and cash used for investing activities of $135;
•purchased approximately 11 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase programs for approximately $400;

•total debt of $4,162, a decrease of $70 from 2021, reflecting repurchases of $69 of the 5.125% notes due october 2024 (the "5.125% notes") during 2022; and
•the company's common stock had a closing price of $39.41 per share at december 30, 2022, an increase of $26.21 per share, or 199%, since the arconic inc. separation transaction on april 1, 2020, compared to an increase of 55% for both the s&p 500® index and s&p aerospace & defense select industry index over the same period.
(1)see below in results of operations for the reconciliation of total segment adjusted ebitda to income from continuing operations before income taxes.
in 2023, management projects sales to increase as we expect solid growth in the commercial aerospace market, and the company's strong position in that market is expected to continue. earnings per share is expected to grow as management continues to focus on operational performance. cash provided from operations is expected to increase for the full year in 2023 compared with 2022, resulting from a continued focus on operating performance and on capital efficiency. capital expenditures are expected to be less than depreciation and amortization.
results of operations earnings summary sales. sales for 2022 were $5,663 compared with $4,972 in 2021, an increase of $691, or 14%. the increase was primarily due to higher sales in the commercial aerospace market, an increase in material cost pass through of $225, and favorable product pricing of $67, partially offset by lower sales in the defense aerospace market. price increases are in excess of material and inflationary pass through to our customers.
sales for 2021 were $4,972 compared with $5,259 in 2020, a decrease of $287, or 5%. the decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the commercial aerospace market driven by the impact of covid-19 and boeing 787 production declines and lower sales in the defense aerospace market, partially offset by growth in the commercial transportation and industrial gas turbine markets as well as favorable product pricing of $97. price increases are in excess of material and inflationary cost pass through to our customers.
cost of goods sold ("cogs"). cogs as a percentage of sales was 72.5% in 2022 compared with 72.3% in 2021. the increase was primarily due to increased costs related to three plant fires, as well as material cost pass through and increased net headcount, primarily in the engine products and fastening systems segments, in anticipation of future revenue increases, partially offset by higher volumes and favorable product pricing. the company had total cogs charges of $59 in 2022, offset by partial insurance claims reimbursements of $23, related to fires that occurred in 2019 at a fastening systems plant in france (the "france plant fire"), at a forged wheels plant in barberton, ohio in mid-february 2020 (the "barberton plant fire"), and a mechanical failure resulting in substantial heat and fire-related damage to equipment at the company's cast house in barberton, ohio in the third quarter of 2022 (the "barberton cast house incident"), compared to total cogs charges of $28 in 2021, offset by partial insurance claims reimbursements of $32, related to the france plant fire and the barberton plant fire. the insurance claims related to these three plant fires were in excess of the insurance deductible. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company settled the insurance claim related to the barberton plant fire. the downtime related to these plant fires in 2022 and 2021 reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plants. the company anticipates additional charges related to these plant fires of approximately $5 to $10 in 2023.
cogs as a percentage of sales was 72.3% in 2021 compared with 73.7% in 2020. the decrease was primarily due to structural cost reductions and favorable product pricing. additionally, the company submitted insurance claims related to the france plant fire and barberton plant fire and received partial settlements of $32 in 2021 compared to $39 in 2020, which were in excess of the insurance deductibles. in 2021, the company recorded charges of $28 related to plant fires compared to $41 in 2020. the downtime reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plants.
selling, general administrative, and other expenses ("sg&a"). sg&a expenses were $288, or 5.1% of sales, in 2022 compared with $251, or 5.0% of sales, in 2021. the increase in sg&a of $37, or 15%, was primarily due to higher employment, travel, and lease costs in 2022, as well as legal and other advisory reimbursements received in 2021 that did not recur in 2022.
sg&a expenses were $251, or 5.0% of sales, in 2021 compared with $277, or 5.3% of sales, in 2020. the decrease in sg&a of $26, or 9%, was primarily due to overhead cost reductions in 2021 and costs incurred in 2020 associated with the arconic inc. separation transaction that did not recur in 2021.
research and development expenses ("r&d"). r&d expenses were $32 in 2022 compared with $17 in 2021. the increase of $15, or 88%, was primarily due to higher spending on technology projects across all segments.
r&d expenses were $17 in both 2021 and 2020.
table of contents provision for depreciation and amortization ("d&a"). the provision for d&a was $265 in 2022 compared with $270 in 2021. the decrease of $5, or 2%, was primarily driven by lower corporate software amortization and reduced depreciation due to the sale of the corporate center.
the provision for d&a was $270 in 2021 compared with $279 in 2020. the decrease of $9, or 3%, was primarily driven by lower corporate software amortization and research center depreciation as well as $1 of d&a related to the barberton plant fire in 2021 compared to $6 in 2020.
restructuring and other charges. restructuring and other charges were $56 in 2022 compared with $90 in 2021 and $182 in 2020.
restructuring and other charges in 2022 consisted primarily of a $58 charge for u.s. and united kingdom ("u.k.") pension plans' settlement accounting and a $6 charge for various other exit costs. these charges were partially offset by a gain of $8 on the sale of assets at a small u.s. manufacturing facility in engine products. the company has closed some small manufacturing facilities and may in the future close additional small facilities in order to consolidate operations, reduce fixed costs, and exit less profitable businesses.
restructuring and other charges in 2021 consisted primarily of a $75 charge for u.k. and u.s. pension plans' settlement accounting, a $15 charge for accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of small u.s. manufacturing facilities in engine products and fastening systems, a $7 charge for layoff costs, a $4 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in france, and a $4 charge for various other exit costs. these charges were partially offset by a gain of $12 on the sale of assets at a small u.s. manufacturing facility in fastening systems and a benefit of $3 related to the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods.
restructuring and other charges in 2020 consisted primarily of a $113 charge for layoff costs, a $74 charge for u.k. and u.s. pension plans' settlement accounting, a $5 post-closing adjustment related to the sale of the company's u.k. forgings business, a $5 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell an aerospace components business in the u.k, which ultimately did not occur and the business was returned to held for use, and a $5 charge related to the impairment of a cost method investment. these charges were partially offset by a benefit of $21 related to the reversal of a number of prior period programs.
see note e to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $229 in 2022 compared with $259 in 2021. the decrease of $30, or 12%, was primarily due to a reduced average level of debt for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. on an annual basis, the partial repayment of the 5.125% notes in 2022 will decrease interest expense, net by approximately $4.
interest expense, net was $259 in 2021 compared with $317 in 2020. the decrease of $58, or 18%, was primarily due to a reduced average level of debt for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020.
see note r to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
loss on debt redemption. debt redemption or tender premiums include the cost to redeem or repurchase certain of the company's notes at a price which may be equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, or a price based on the market price of its notes. loss on debt redemption was $2 in 2022 compared with $146 in 2021. the decrease of $144 was primarily due to higher debt premiums paid in 2021 related to the repurchases of the 6.875% notes due 2025 (the "6.875% notes"), the 5.870% notes due 2022, and the 5.125% notes.
loss on debt redemption was $146 in 2021 compared with $64 in 2020. the increase of $82, or 128%, was primarily due to debt premiums paid in 2021 on the 6.875% notes, partially offset by debt redemption or tender premiums, as applicable, paid in 2020 on the repurchases of the 6.150% notes due 2020 (the "6.150% notes") and the 5.400% notes due 2021.
see note r to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
other expense, net. other expense, net was $82 in 2022 compared with $19 in 2021. the increase in expense of $63 was primarily driven by the adverse judgment of $65 related to lehman brothers international (europe) ("lbie") swaps that were entered into in 2007 and 2008, which were assumed as part of the firth rixson acquisition in 2014, an increase from net realized and unrealized losses of $9, primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on exchange-traded fixed income securities and losses on sales of receivables, and higher non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2022 of $7, partially offset by the impacts of deferred compensation arrangements of $16
table of contents and higher interest income of $4. non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans is expected to increase by approximately $20 from 2022 to 2023.
other expense, net was $19 in 2021 compared with $74 in 2020. the decrease in expense of $55 was primarily driven by the write-off of an indemnification receivable of $53 related to a spanish tax reserve, reflecting alcoa corporation's 49% share and arconic corporation's 33.66% share, that occurred in 2020 and did not occur in 2021 and lower non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 of $17, which were partially offset by an increase in foreign currency gains of $13. non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans declined approximately 65% from 2020 to 2021.
income taxes. howmet's effective tax rate was 22.6% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2022 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $12 charge related to an increase in the valuation allowance on a foreign tax credit carryforward in the u.s., $8 of charges related to u.s. tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") and other foreign earnings, $8 of charges related to nondeductible expenses, and $5 of incremental state tax and foreign taxes on earnings also subject to u.s. federal income tax, partially offset by a $6 benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on interest deduction carryforwards in the u.k., a $5 benefit related to a tax accounting method change, a $5 excess benefit for stock compensation, and a $3 benefit related to a distribution of foreign earnings. the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "act") was signed into law on august 16, 2022. the act includes various tax provisions, including a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to u.s. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1,000. the company does not expect the act to materially impact its financial statements. howmet anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 22.5% and 23.5%.
howmet's effective tax rate was 20.4% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2021 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $32 benefit from the recognition of income tax credits related to development incentives in hungary, and a $9 benefit related to updated u.s. regulatory guidance concerning the utilization of foreign tax credits in connection with the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of previously non-taxed post-1986 earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries enacted as part of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 act"), partially offset by $9 of charges from the decision to no longer permanently reinvest earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries, $7 of charges from distributions of foreign earnings, $8 of charges to establish a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses in switzerland, $6 of charges related to u.s. tax on foreign income, and other impacts related to nondeductible expenses including foreign losses with no tax benefit.
howmet's effective tax rate was 23.4% (benefit on pre-tax income) in 2020 compared with the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. the effective rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $64 benefit related to the release of an income tax reserve following a favorable spanish tax case decision, a $30 benefit related to the recognition of a previously uncertain u.s. tax position, and a $30 benefit for a u.s. tax law change related to the issuance of final regulations that provide for an exclusion of certain high-taxed foreign earnings from the calculation of gilti, partially offset by u.s. tax on foreign earnings, $8 of charges related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances as a result of the arconic inc. separation transaction, the tax impact of $49 of nondeductible loss related to the reversal of indemnification receivables associated with the favorable spanish tax case decision, and the tax impact of other nondeductible expenses.
net income from continuing operations. net income from continuing operations was $469, or $1.11 per diluted share, for 2022 compared to $258, or $0.59 per diluted share, in 2021. the increase in results of $211, or 82%, was primarily due to higher sales in the commercial aerospace market, a decrease in the loss on debt redemption of $144, favorable product pricing of $67, a decrease of $34 in restructuring and other charges, and a decrease in interest expense, net of $30, partially offset by lower sales in the defense aerospace market, an increase in other inflationary costs, the adverse judgment related to the lbie legal proceeding of $65, and an increase in the provision for income taxes primarily driven by an increase in income before income taxes.
net income from continuing operations was $258, or $0.59 per diluted share, for 2021 compared to $211, or $0.48 per diluted share, in 2020. the increase in results of $47, or 22%, was primarily due to cost reductions, a decrease of $92 in restructuring and other charges, and a decrease of $58 in interest expense, net, due to lower long-term debt levels, partially offset by lower sales in the commercial aerospace and defense aerospace market, an increase in the provision for income taxes, and an increase in the loss on debt redemption of $82.
net income. net income was $469 for 2022, all of which was composed of $469 of income from continuing operations, or $1.11 per diluted share.
net income was $258 for 2021, all of which was composed of $258 of income from continuing operations, or $0.59 per diluted share.
table of contents net income was $261 for 2020, composed of $211 of income from continuing operations and $50 from discontinued operations as a result of the arconic inc. separation transaction, or $0.48 and $0.11 per diluted share, respectively.
see details of discontinued operations in note c to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.
segment information the company's operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures and forged wheels. segment performance under howmet's management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is segment adjusted ebitda. prior to the first quarter of 2022, the company used segment operating profit as its primary measure of performance. however, the company's ceo believes that segment adjusted ebitda is now a better representation of its business because it provides additional information with respect to the company's operating performance and the company's ability to meet its financial obligations. howmet's definition of segment adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. net margin is equivalent to sales minus the following items: cost of goods sold; selling, general administrative, and other expenses; research and development expenses; and provision for depreciation and amortization. special items, including restructuring and other charges, are excluded from net margin and segment adjusted ebitda. segment adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in corporate (see note d to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k).
the company has aligned its operations consistent with how the ceo assesses operating performance and allocates capital.
the company produces aerospace engine parts and components and aerospace fastening systems for 737 max airplanes. from late december 2019 and throughout 2020, boeing suspended production of 737 max airplanes. while regulatory authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020, our sales remained at lower levels throughout 2021 due to the residual impacts of the 737 max grounding. sales related to the 737 max improved in 2022 year over year, contributing to commercial aerospace growth.
the company also produces aerospace engine parts and components and aerospace fastening systems for boeing 787 airplanes. boeing paused deliveries of its 787 aircraft between may 2021 and august 2022. as a result of the significant decline in boeing 787 production rates, our sales remained at lower levels throughout 2022. we expect increased sales related to the boeing 787 in 2023 year over year.
income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled $606 in 2022, $324 in 2021, and $171 in 2020. segment adjusted ebitda for all reportable segments totaled $1,352 in 2022, $1,200 in 2021, and $1,152 in 2020. see below for the reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to total segment adjusted ebitda.
the following information provides sales, segment adjusted ebitda, and segment adjusted ebitda margin for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022.

liquidity and capital resources howmet maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and the strengthening of its balance sheet. management continued to focus on actions to improve howmet's cost structure and liquidity, providing the company with the ability to operate effectively. such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures.
cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover howmet's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. for an analysis of long-term liquidity, see "contractual obligations" and "off-balance sheet arrangements" below.
at december 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of howmet were $791, of which $283 was held by howmet's non-u.s. subsidiaries. if the cash held by non-u.s. subsidiaries were to be repatriated to the u.s., the company does not expect there to be material income tax consequences.
the cash flows related to arconic corporation have not been segregated and are included in the statement of consolidated cash flows for the period prior to the arconic inc. separation transaction.
operating activities cash provided from operations in 2022 was $733 compared with $449 in 2021 and $9 in 2020.
the increase in cash provided from operations of $284, or 63%, between 2022 and 2021 was due to lower working capital of $165, higher operating results of $89, and lower pension contributions of $53, partially offset by higher payments on noncurrent liabilities of $37. the components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in receivables of $176, including collections of employee retention credit receivables, accrued expenses of $169, accounts payable of $102, and taxes, including income taxes, of $29, partially offset by inventories of $294 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $17.
the increase in cash provided from operations of $440 between 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to lower working capital of $357, lower pension contributions of $161, and lower noncurrent liabilities of $12, partially offset by lower operating results of $38 and the write-off of an indemnification receivable of $53 related to a spanish tax reserve that occurred in 2020 and did not occur in 2021. the components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in accounts payable of $525, accrued expenses of $71, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13, partially offset by taxes, including income taxes of $139, receivables of $99, including employee retention credit receivables, and inventories of $14.
financing activities cash used for financing activities was $526 in 2022 compared with $1,444 in 2021 and $369 in 2020.
the use of cash in 2022 was primarily related to the repurchase of common stock of $400, the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $69, and dividends paid to shareholders of $44. these items were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $16. on an annual basis, the partial repayment of the 5.125% notes due october 2024 (the "5.125% notes") in 2022 will decrease interest expense, net by approximately $4.
the use of cash in 2021 was primarily related to the repayments on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of long-term debt of approximately $1,537, repurchase of common stock of $430, premiums paid on the redemption of debt of $138, dividends paid to shareholders of $19, and debt issuance costs of $11. these items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $700 and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $22.

obligations for operating activities raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium, cobalt, nickel, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to five years. many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. the company generally passes through metal costs in customer contracts with limited exceptions. as a result, the company expects higher metal costs to contribute to increased sales in 2023. in connection with the arconic inc. separation transaction, the company entered into several agreements with arconic corporation that govern the relationship between the company and arconic corporation following the separation, including raw material supply agreements.
operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.
interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2022 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042.
estimated minimum required pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates, among others. it is howmet's policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in the benefits laws and tax laws of the applicable country. periodically, howmet contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. howmet has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2027 and 2032, respectively.
layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs.
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31, 2022. the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the "thereafter" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. tax assessments received may also result in payments to be made in order to preserve our right to appeal any tax positions challenged by tax authorities for which we have concluded that we are more likely than not to prevail.
table of contents contingencies such as legal proceedings and environmental matters may also result in additional cash payments. the timing of these payments, if necessary, depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. accordingly, amounts have not been included in the preceding table. see note v to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k for further discussion.
obligations for financing activities howmet has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. the company paid an aggregate of $44 in common stock and preferred stock dividends to shareholders during 2022. because all dividends are subject to approval by howmet's board of directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. as of december 31, 2022, there were 412,155,057 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding class a preferred stock. in 2022, the preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share. a dividend of $0.10 per share on the company's common stock was paid in 2022 ($0.02 per share in each of the first, second, and third quarters of 2022 and $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2022). fully diluted shares outstanding as of december 31, 2022 were 418,011,145.
the company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1,500 of the company's outstanding common stock. after giving effect to the share repurchases made through the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately $947 board authorization remained available as of january 1, 2023. there is no stated expiration for the share repurchase programs. accordingly, amounts have not been included in the preceding table. see "liquidity and capital resources" for additional information.
obligations for investing activities capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31, 2022. funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. it is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 4% of sales in 2023.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2022, the company had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers' compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. the total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2023 and 2040, was $13 at december 31, 2022.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of october 31, 2016, between howmet and alcoa corporation, howmet was required to provide certain guarantees for alcoa corporation, which had a combined fair value of $6 at both december 31, 2022 and 2021, and were included in other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheet. the remaining guarantee, for which the company and arconic corporation are secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by alcoa corporation, relates to a long-term energy supply agreement that expires in 2047 at an alcoa corporation facility. the company currently views the risk of an alcoa corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. the company and arconic corporation are required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,040 and $1,406 at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the event of an alcoa corporation payment default. in december 2020, december 2021, and december 2022, a surety bond with a limit of $80 relating to this guarantee was obtained by alcoa corporation to protect howmet's obligation. this surety bond is expected to be renewed on an annual basis by alcoa corporation.
howmet has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers' compensation, environmental obligations, and insurance obligations. the total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2023, was $120 at december 31, 2022.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreements between the company and arconic corporation and between the company and alcoa corporation, the company is required to retain letters of credit of $53 (which are included in the $120 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided related to the company, arconic corporation, and alcoa corporation workers' compensation claims that occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of april 1, 2020 and november 1, 2016. arconic corporation and alcoa corporation workers' compensation and letter of credit fees paid by the company are proportionally billed to, and are reimbursed by, arconic corporation and alcoa corporation, respectively. also, the company was required to provide letters of credit for certain arconic corporation environmental obligations and, as a result, the company has $17 of outstanding letters of credit relating to such liabilities (which are included in the $120 in the above paragraph). arconic corporation has issued surety bonds to cover these environmental obligations. arconic corporation is being billed for these letter of credit fees paid by the company and will reimburse the company for any payments made under these letters of credit.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes. these estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations relating to the impact of covid-19 and changes in the aerospace industry as a result of the pandemic. the impact of these changes is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and, as a result, these conditions remain highly uncertain. areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include the testing of goodwill, properties, plants, and equipment, and other intangible assets for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company's consolidated financial statements at any given time. despite these inherent limitations, management believes that management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company.
a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.
goodwill. howmet reviews goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. the company has the option to assess impairment through qualitative assessment, which includes factors such as general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. howmet can also assess goodwill impairment through a quantitative analysis, using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. assumptions and estimates utilized in the dcf model include weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") rates, revenue, future profitability, working capital, cash flows and a number of other items. for more information on these matters, see note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
properties, plants, and equipment and other intangible assets. properties, plants, and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a dcf model. the determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.
discontinued operations and assets held for sale. the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits. liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). the pension and other postretirement benefits obligation was $1,719 and $2,461, with a funded status of $(749) and $(930) at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the total benefit obligation reduction of $742 was primarily driven by changes in discount rate. the improvement in the funded status of $181 was primarily driven by changes in discount rates partially offset by actual asset losses in comparison to expected asset returns. excluding settlements and curtailments, net periodic benefit cost of pension and other postretirement benefits is expected to be approximately $40 in 2023 compared to $22 and $16 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. these costs increased by $6, or 38%, in 2022 compared to 2021 as a result of changes in discount rates and annuity purchases.
employer contributions for pension benefits were $43 and $96 for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. no additional employer contributions for pension benefits were required for the pension settlements in 2022. benefits paid for other postretirement benefits were $13 and $17 for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. total pension contributions and other postretirement benefits paid decreased by $57, or 50%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by additional 2021 contributions related to annuity buyouts and funding balances of the plans. cash pension contributions in 2023 are expected to be approximately $45. howmet's funded status under the employee retirement income security act was approximately 87% as of january 1, 2022.
the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the u.s. is determined using a company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary, while both the u.k. and canada utilize models developed by the respective actuary. the cash flows of the plans' projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. the yield curve models parallel the plans' projected cash flows, which have a global average duration of 10 years. the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the models exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company's plans' obligations multiple times. in 2022, 2021, and 2020, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 5.40%, 2.70%, and 2.40%, respectively. the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $36 and either a charge or credit of less than $1 to earnings in the following year.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets. the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. as it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management's own judgment.
for 2022, 2021, and 2020, management used 6.70%, 6.20%, and 6.00%, respectively, as its weighted-average global expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class for each plan. these rates were within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class for each plan. the increase in expected long-term rate of return of plan assets compared to prior years is due to current asset allocations and estimates of future returns by country. for 2023, management anticipates that the expected long-term rate of return for global plan assets will remain at approximately 7%. a change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact earnings by approximately $3 for 2023.
in 2022, net income of $146 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate and amortization of actuarial losses, partially offset by plan asset returns that were less than expected. in 2021, net income of $181 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the increase in the discount rate, plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and amortization of actuarial losses. in 2020, a net loss of $46 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and amortization of actuarial losses.
table of contents stock-based compensation. howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model. determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.
compensation expense recorded in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $54 ($49 after-tax), $40 ($36 after-tax), and $46 ($42 after-tax), respectively.
income taxes. the provision (benefit) for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, the provision (benefit) for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) based on current year pre-tax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of howmet's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and howmet's experience with similar operations. existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.
it is howmet's policy to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti inclusions. under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. instead, future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.
it is howmet's policy to treat taxes due from future inclusions in u.s. taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.
litigation and contingent liabilities. from time to time, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings. these matters may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors, such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. if an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and the amount of the potential loss can be estimated, the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed probable but the loss is not reasonably estimable, or if an unfavorable outcome is deemed reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed but no liability is recorded. legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management's judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. for more information on these matters, see note v to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 (financial statements and supplementary data) of this form 10-k.

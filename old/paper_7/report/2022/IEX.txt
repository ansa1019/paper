cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales increased due to higher sales volume, inflation and acquisitions. both gross profit and gross margin increased primarily due to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and productivity and the acceleration of previously deferred revenue related to the exit of a covid-19 testing application, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs. gross profit also increased as a result of acquisitions, net of the knight divestiture, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased primarily due to the impact from acquisitions, including amortization, as well as higher discretionary spending, resource investments and employee-related costs. additionally, the prior year included a $3.5 million impact of a settlement for a corporate transaction indemnity that did not reoccur in 2022.
restructuring expenses and asset impairments restructuring expenses and asset impairments increased primarily due to an asset impairment related to the exit of a covid-19 testing application, partially offset by lower severance costs in 2022. see note 15 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
operating income operating income increased 18%, reflecting a 19% increase in organic operating income, a 2% increase from acquisitions net of divestitures (knight - september 2022), a 1% favorable net impact from the exit of a covid-19 testing application, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. the increase in organic operating income is attributable to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and operational productivity, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments.
operating margin operating margin increased 60 basis points, reflecting a 130 basis point increase in organic operating margin, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease due to acquisitions primarily driven by higher amortization. the increase in organic operating margin is primarily due to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and operational productivity, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments.
gain on sale of business in the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of knight for proceeds of $49.4 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $34.8 million. the company recorded $5.5 million of income tax expense associated with this transaction as provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income during the year ended december 31, 2022.
other (income) expense - net other (income) expense - net was $3.9 million of income in 2022 compared to $16.2 million of expense in 2021. the prior year included an $8.6 million noncash loss related to the termination of the u.s. pension plan, net of curtailment and an $8.6 million loss on early debt redemption. additionally, 2022 included $3.1 million of gains on the sale of assets and $2.5 million of foreign currency transaction gains, partially offset by $2.3 million of losses on trading securities.
interest expense interest expense decreased primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates on the company's indebtedness, partially offset by an increase in the amount of debt outstanding compared with 2021 due to borrowings under the term facility and the revolving facility, both of which were used to fund the acquisition of muon group. additionally, the prior year included $1.6 million of interest expense for the interest rate contract associated with the 4.20% senior notes that did not reoccur in 2022.
income taxes the company's provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state, and foreign income. the provision for income taxes increased $32.2 million to $162.7 million in 2022 as compared with $130.5 million in 2021 due to higher earnings. the 2022 effective tax rate of 21.7% decreased compared with the 2021 effective tax rate of 22.5% primarily due to tax benefits realized from the divestiture of knight as well as from realizing foreign currency impacts in connection with the funding of the acquisition of muon group.
results of reportable business segments the company has three reportable segments: fluid & metering technologies ("fmt"), health & science technologies ("hst") and fire & safety/diversified products ("fsdp"). for a detailed description of the operations within each segment, please refer to part i, item 1, "business" of this annual report on form 10-k.
within its three reportable segments, the company maintains 13 reporting units where the company focuses on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. management's primary measurements of segment performance are sales, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company changed the segment measure of profit and loss used by the chief operating decision maker ("codm") in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 280, segment reporting, from operating income to adjusted ebitda. the change in segment measure of profit and loss aligns with how the codm allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the business. it also allows the company to better assess operating results over time since it excludes items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. for further discussion related to the company's change in the segment measure of profit and loss used by the codm as well as the definition of adjusted ebitda, refer to note 14 in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

•sales increased 24% domestically and 9% internationally. sales to customers outside the u.s. were approximately 43% and 47% of total segment sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•the change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the pumps reporting unit due to continued favorable demand in the industrial and energy markets as well as strong price capture. additionally, there were increases in the energy reporting unit due to a continued rebound in the refined fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and aviation markets as well as improved operational performance, increases in the agriculture reporting unit due to strong market performance driven by favorable commodity prices and global demand for crops and increases in the water reporting unit due to an overall positive municipal water market and water-saving targeted growth initiatives.
•adjusted ebitda margin of 32.1% increased 240 basis points compared with 29.7% in 2021. the change in adjusted ebitda margin was attributed to the following:
◦organic adjusted ebitda margin increased 280 basis points due to strong price/cost, favorable productivity and higher volume leverage, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments.
◦acquisitions negatively impacted adjusted ebitda margin by 40 basis points due to the dilutive impact from acquisitions on overall fmt adjusted ebitda margin.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity based on management's current expectations and currently available information, the company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the revolving facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the company's common stock for the foreseeable future. additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings.
at december 31, 2022, working capital was $855.7 million and the company's current ratio was 2.6 to 1. at december 31, 2022, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $430.2 million, of which $373.1 million was held outside of the united states. at december 31, 2022, there was $77.7 million outstanding under the revolving facility and $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility of $714.4 million. the company believes that additional borrowings through various financing alternatives remain available, if required.

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $7.9 million to $557.4 million in 2022 as higher earnings were more than offset by an increased investment in working capital.
operating working capital, calculated as receivables - net plus inventories minus trade accounts payable, is used by management as a measurement of operational results as well as the short-term liquidity of the company. the following table details operating working capital as of december 31, 2022 and 2021:

operating working capital                       $704.8                  $548.0
operating working capital increased $156.8 million to $704.8 million at december 31, 2022. acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation contributed $31.9 million to the increase in operating working capital. excluding those items, receivables - net increased $63.1 million as a result of higher volume; inventories increased $79.0 million to support production amid supply chain challenges; and trade accounts payable increased $17.2 million due to higher inventory purchases.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased $219.1 million to $917.2 million in 2022, primarily due to higher cash outflows for acquisitions with the addition of muon group, kzvalve and nexsight in 2022 compared to airtech and abel in 2021, partially offset by proceeds received from both the sale of knight and the sale of marketable securities in 2022 as well as higher proceeds from asset sales in 2022 compared to 2021.
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased $28.3 million from $9.5 million in 2021 to $37.8 million in 2022. during 2022, the company repurchased 795,423 shares at a cost of $148.1 million, paid $177.4 million in dividends, borrowed $210.4 million under the revolving facility and $200.0 million under the term facility and repaid $135.0 million of the revolving facility. during 2021, the company issued $500.0 million of 2.625% senior notes, redeemed $350.0 million of 4.20% senior notes and paid $161.1 million in dividends.
free cash flow the company believes free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, is an important measure of performance because it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations such as operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the company's common stock as well as for funding acquisitions and share repurchases. free cash flow is calculated as cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
the following table reconciles free cash flow to cash flows provided by operating activities:

(1) free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income attributable to idex reflects the impact of excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, net of related taxes, from adjusted net income attributable to idex in both periods presented.
the decrease in free cash flow as compared to 2021 is due to the increases in working capital discussed above, which more than offset higher earnings.
cash requirements contractual obligations the company's contractual obligations include borrowings and related interest, purchase obligations, pension and post-retirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, a transition tax payable and other obligations arising in the ordinary course of business (such as acquisition commitments). there are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of the company's credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations. for a description of the funding requirements related to the company's contractual obligations, refer to note 4 (transition tax payable), note 7 (borrowings and related interest), note 10 (lease obligations) and note 18 (pension and post-retirement obligations) in the notes to consolidated financial statements, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, the company's purchase obligations, consisting primarily of inventory commitments, totaled approximately $364.4 million, of which $336.4 million is expected to be settled during 2023 and the remainder thereafter.
capital expenditures capital expenditures generally include machinery and equipment that support growth and improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. the company believes it has sufficient operating cash flows to continue to meet current obligations and invest in planned capital expenditures. in 2022 and 2021, cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $68.0 million and $72.7 million, respectively. the company recently invested a significant amount of capital to expand the china facility which was completed in late 2022 and the india facility which is expected to be completed in early 2023, ultimately doubling the company's historic capacity in each of these countries. otherwise, management considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the company's operations and believes it has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity.
debt repayment as of december 31, 2022, the company has $100.0 million of 3.20% senior notes due june 2023. the company expects to either refinance or repay the notes using the available borrowing capacity of the revolving facility, due november 2027.

goodwill and intangible assets - the company's business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods. the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. the company follows the guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification ("asc") 350, goodwill and other intangible assets, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. the company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. the relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations. based on the results of the company's annual impairment test at october 31, 2022, all reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.
the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine the fair value. various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted ebitda and terminal growth rates. the following assumption ranges were utilized by the company in 2022 and 2021:
assumptions                                             2022                 2021
range                range weighted average cost of capital             9.75% to 11.50%       8.25% to 9.75%
market multiples                              10.0x to 19.0x       13.0x to 22.0x terminal growth rates                           2.5% to 3.5%         2.5% to 3.5%
see note 6 for further discussion on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
non-gaap disclosures set forth below are reconciliations of each of organic sales, adjusted net sales, adjusted net income attributable to idex, adjusted diluted earnings per share ("eps") attributable to idex, consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") and consolidated adjusted ebitda margin to its respective most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. management uses these metrics to measure performance of the company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as fair value inventory step-up charges, restructuring expenses and asset impairments, the impact from the exit of a covid-19 testing application, gain on sale of a business, gains on sales of assets, the impact of the settlement of a corporate transaction indemnity, the loss on early debt redemption, the noncash loss related to the termination of the u.s. pension plan, net of curtailment and acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. management also supplements its u.s. gaap financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
this report references organic sales and organic operating income, non-gaap measures, that exclude (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales and operating income, respectively, from acquired or divested businesses during the first 12 months of ownership or prior to divestiture and (3) the impact from the exit of a covid-19 testing application. the portion of sales and operating income attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. management believes that reporting organic sales and organic operating income provides useful information to investors by helping to identify underlying growth trends in the company's business and facilitating easier comparisons of the company's revenue and operating performance with prior and future periods and to its peers. the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales and organic operating income because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult due to the varying nature, size and number of transactions from period to period and between the company and its peers. the company excludes the impact from the exit of a covid-19 testing application because it is not reflective of ongoing operations and can obscure underlying business trends.
management believes that adjusted ebitda, which is ebitda adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations. the company believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the company and its segments' ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the company's industry. management believes that adjusted ebitda margin is useful for the same reason as adjusted ebitda. the definition of adjusted ebitda used here may differ from that used by other companies.
this report also references free cash flow. this non-gaap measure is discussed and reconciled to its most directly comparable gaap measure in the section above titled "free cash flow."
the non-gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up or recalculate precisely. the financial results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

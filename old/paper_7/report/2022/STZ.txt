item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. refer to item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources" located in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended february 28, 2022, filed on april 21, 2022, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended february 28, 2021, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented. this md&a, which should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, is organized as follows:
overview.    this section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends.
strategy.    this section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of recent developments, global supply chain and covid-19 related impacts, and significant divestitures, acquisitions, and investments.
results of operations.    this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis. in addition, a brief description of significant transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided.
liquidity and capital resources.    this section provides an analysis of our cash flows, outstanding debt, liquidity position, and commitments. included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the financial capacity available to fund our on-going operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates.    this section identifies accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment, and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1.
overview our internal management financial reporting consists of three business divisions: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, and (iii) canopy and we report our operating results in four segments: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, (iii) corporate operations and other, and (iv) canopy. our canopy equity method investment makes up the canopy segment. if the canopy transaction is completed, including conversion of our canopy common shares into exchangeable shares, we expect our internal management financial reporting to consist of two business divisions: (i) beer and (ii) wine and spirits and we will report our operating results in three segments: (i) beer, (ii) wine and spirits, and (iii) corporate operations and other.
in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands, craft beer, and abas. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our mexican beer portfolio in the u.s. in the wine and spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, it, legal, and public relations, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. all costs included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our codm's evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents strategy our business strategy for the beer segment focuses on strengthening our leadership position in the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market and continuing to grow our brands through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. this includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, including within the 3-tier ecommerce channel, as well as continued expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities at our breweries in mexico. additionally, in an effort to compete more fully in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to create new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats that are intended to meet emerging needs.
expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue under our mexico beer projects to align with our anticipated future growth expectations, and we expect to spend an additional $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion over fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2026 on these activities. see "capital expenditures" below. additionally, we are pursuing the sale of the remaining assets at the canceled mexicali brewery after exploring various options; however, we may not be successful in completing any such sale or obtaining other forms of recovery.
our business strategy for the wine and spirits segment focuses on higher-end brands, improving margins, and creating operating efficiencies. we continue to refine our portfolio primarily through an enhanced focus on higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. our business is organized into two distinct commercial teams, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands. while each team has its own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to the goal of accelerating performance by growing organic net sales and expanding margins. in addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences. our business continues to progressively expand into dtc channels (including hospitality), 3-tier ecommerce, and international markets, while continuing to grow in u.s. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution. in markets where it is feasible, we entered into a contractual arrangement with southern glazer's wine and spirits to consolidate our u.s. distribution in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this u.s. distributor currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s.
marketing, sales, and distribution of our products are primarily managed on a geographic basis allowing us to leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, aba, and branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we complement our strategy with our investment in canopy by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. canopy is a leading cannabis and cpg company with operations in canada, the u.s., germany, and certain other global markets. this investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. our strategic relationship with canopy is designed to help position it to be successful in cannabis production, branding, and intellectual property. we expect this relationship to continue through the completion of the canopy transaction including the conversion of our canopy common shares into exchangeable shares. for further information on our plan to convert our canopy common stock ownership, see "canopy segment" below.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth as well as our target net leverage ratio and dividend payout ratio; invest to support the growth of our business; and deliver additional returns to stockholders through periodic share repurchases. our results of operations and financial condition have been affected by inflation, changing prices, and reductions in discretionary income of consumers available to purchase our products, as well as other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, geopolitical events, and military conflicts, such as repercussions from the conflict in ukraine. we expect some or all of these impacts to continue into fiscal 2024. we intend to continue to monitor the inflationary environment and the impact on the consumer when we consider passing along rising costs through further selling price increases, subject to normal competitive constellation brands, inc. fy 2023 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 34
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents conditions. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives, including our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully mitigate rising costs through increased selling prices and/or cost savings initiatives. furthermore, to the extent climate-related severe weather events, such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and/or late frosts, continue to occur or accelerate in future periods, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
recent developments
2023 canopy promissory note in april 2023, we extended the maturity of the remaining c$100.0 million principal amount of our canopy debt securities by exchanging them for the 2023 canopy promissory note. the 2023 canopy promissory note bears interest at an annual rate of 4.25% and matures on december 31, 2024. canopy may prepay the 2023 canopy promissory note in whole or in part at any time prior to the maturity date. if the canopy amendment is authorized by canopy's shareholders, we maintain our intention to negotiate an exchange of the c$100.0 million principal amount of the 2023 canopy promissory note for exchangeable shares, although neither we nor canopy has any binding obligation to do so.
daleville facility in march 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the daleville facility. we expect the transaction to close during the three months ending may 31, 2023, subject to required regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. the net cash proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used primarily for general corporate purposes, including retirement of debt.
global supply chain and covid-19 related impacts we believe the impact of covid-19 on our business has largely diminished at this time; however, uncertainties continue, particularly around disruptions to the global supply chain and shifting consumer behaviors. fiscal 2023 was, and fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to be, impacted by challenges with both global supply and transportation which have contributed to higher cost of product sold. for example, wine produced in new zealand and italy and subsequently shipped to the u.s. for distribution continues to be affected by increased costs of ocean freight shipping. in addition, during fiscal 2022, we experienced a brown glass purchasing shortage, which impacted certain of our imported beer brands. this supply returned to normal levels in early fiscal 2023. to the extent these or similar circumstances continue to occur or accelerate in future periods it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
we have seen consumers shift more of their total shopping spend to online channels since the covid-19 outbreak, which has led to increased ecommerce sales, including dtc, for our business. covid-19 may continue to impact consumers' purchasing and consumption patterns. in response to covid-19, we have ensured our on-going liquidity and financial flexibility through cash preservation initiatives, capital management adjustments, and cost control measures. we used opportunities under the cares act afforded to us earlier in the pandemic to defer some payments including certain payroll taxes. we believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our revolving credit facility. we expect to have continued access to capital markets and to be able to continue to return value to stockholders through dividends and periodic share repurchases.
divestitures, acquisitions, and investments wine and spirits segment
2022 wine divestiture in october 2022, we sold certain of our mainstream and premium wine brands and related inventory. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of such mainstream and premium wine brands through the date of divestiture. we received cash proceeds of $96.7 million from the 2022 wine divestiture that were utilized primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. we recognized a net gain of $15.0 million on the sale of business for fiscal 2023. this gain was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents austin cocktails acquisition in april 2022, we acquired the remaining 73% ownership interest in austin cocktails, which included a portfolio of small batch, rtd cocktails. this transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill and a trademark. the results of operations of austin cocktails are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
lingua franca acquisition in march 2022, we acquired the lingua franca business, including a collection of oregon-based luxury wines, a vineyard, and a production facility. this transaction also included the acquisition of a trademark and inventory. the results of operations of lingua franca are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
my favorite neighbor acquisition in november 2021, we acquired the remaining 65% ownership interest in my favorite neighbor, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. the results of operations of my favorite neighbor are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
our recent divestiture and acquisitions support our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers.
corporate operations and other segment corporate investment in february 2022, we sold an investment made through our corporate venture capital function. we recognized our share of their equity in earnings (losses) in our consolidated financial statements in the corporate operations and other segment up to the date we sold our ownership interest.
canopy segment canopy investment we have evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of february 28, 2023, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary impairment. our conclusion was based primarily on the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value. we will continue to review the canopy equity method investment for an other-than-temporary impairment. if canopy's stock price does not recover above our carrying value in the near-term, it may result in an additional impairment of our canopy equity method investment.
in february 2023, canopy announced the next series of comprehensive steps to align its canadian cannabis operations and resources in response to continued unfavorable market trends. in connection with these next steps, canopy disclosed that it expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately c$425 million to c$525 million in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and in its first half of fiscal 2024 results. we will record our proportional share of canopy's estimated pre-tax loss of approximately c$145 million to c$180 million, in our applicable fiscal 2024 results.
additionally, we evaluated the canopy equity method investment as of august 31, 2022, and determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment. our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended june 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of u.s. federal cannabis permissibility. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. this loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for fiscal 2023.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents in july 2022, we received 29.2 million common shares of canopy following the exchange of c$100.0 million principal amount of our canopy debt securities. this exchange did not significantly change our canopy ownership percentage.
plan to convert canopy common stock ownership in october 2022, we entered into a consent agreement with canopy pursuant to which we have provided our consent, subject to certain conditions, to the canopy transaction. assuming the completion of the canopy transaction and the transactions contemplated by the consent agreement and that we elect to convert our canopy common shares into exchangeable shares:
•we intend to surrender our november 2018 canopy warrants to canopy for cancellation;
•we will only have an interest in exchangeable shares, which are non-voting and non-participating securities, and our 2023 canopy promissory note (for which we intend to negotiate an exchange of the principal amount for exchangeable shares, although neither we nor canopy has any binding obligation to do so);
•we intend to terminate all legacy agreements and commercial arrangements between ourselves and canopy, including the investor rights agreement but excluding the consent agreement and certain termination agreements;
•we will have no further governance rights in relation to canopy, including rights to nominate members to the board of directors of canopy, or approval rights related to certain transactions;
•all of our nominees will resign from the board of directors of canopy; and
•as our investment in canopy common shares makes up our canopy equity method investment, we expect to no longer:
◦apply the equity method to our investment in canopy, which we expect to instead be accounted for at fair value with changes reported in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results; and
◦have a stand-alone canopy operating segment as canopy's financial results are not expected to be provided to, or reviewed by, our codm and will not be used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance.
for additional information on recent developments, investments, acquisitions, and divestitures, refer to notes 2, 7, 10, and 22.
results of operations financial highlights references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of the 2022 wine divestiture, as appropriate.
fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
•our results of operations were primarily impacted by (i) a decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in canopy, (ii) an impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2022 in connection with certain assets at the mexicali brewery, (iii) improvements within the beer segment driven by shipment volume growth, and (iv) a decrease in inventory obsolescence within the beer segment, driven by a slowdown in the overall hard seltzer category in early fiscal 2022, partially offset by (i) a fiscal 2023 impairment of our canopy equity method investment, (ii) an increase in equity in losses from canopy's results primarily driven by their goodwill impairment, (iii) higher operational and logistics costs within both the beer and wine and spirits segments, (iv) increase in beer media investments, (v) impacts of trademark and other long-lived asset impairment losses, and (vi) an increase in corporate operations and other general and administrative expenses, driven by digital business acceleration investments and a fiscal 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents
•net sales increased 7% largely due to an increase in beer net sales driven primarily by shipment volume growth and favorable impact from pricing.
•operating income increased 22% largely due to (i) the impact of the impairment of long-lived assets in connection with certain assets at the mexicali brewery for fiscal 2022 and (ii) improvements within the beer segment, including the decrease in inventory obsolescence, partially offset by (i) the higher operational and logistics costs, (ii) the increase in beer media investments, (iii) the trademark and other long-lived asset impairment losses, and (iv) the increase in corporate operations and other general and administrative expenses.
•net loss attributable to cbi increased due to an increase in loss from unconsolidated investments and higher provision for income taxes as compared to fiscal 2022, largely offset by the increase in operating income items discussed above. diluted net loss per common share attributable to cbi decreased as compared to fiscal 2022.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and the incentive compensation of segment management are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss) which does not include the impact of these comparable adjustments.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents the decrease in wine and spirits net sales is due to $44.1 million from the 2022 wine divestiture and a $37.4 million decrease in organic net sales. the decrease in organic net sales is driven by a $148.0 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, including impacts from global supply chain constraints, partially offset by (i) a $90.9 million increase from favorable product mix, (ii) a $17.5 million increase in non-branded net sales driven by dtc, and (iii) $4.1 million of favorable impact from pricing. the decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume and favorable product mix are attributable to the consumer-led premiumization and mix improvements of our portfolio. the favorable impact from pricing was driven by price increases and higher contractual distributor payments as compared to fiscal 2022, largely offset by increases in promotional activity.
canopy segmentour ownership interest in canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in canopy under the equity method. amounts included for the canopy segment represent 100% of canopy's reported results on a two-month lag. accordingly, we recognized our share of canopy's earnings (losses) from january through december 2022, in our fiscal 2023 results and january through december 2021, in our fiscal 2022 results. although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of canopy, 100% of its results are included and subsequently eliminated to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements. see "income (loss) from unconsolidated investments" below for a discussion of canopy's net sales, gross profit (loss), selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating income (loss). this discussion is based on information canopy has publicly disclosed.

the increase in beer gross profit is primarily due to the $279.7 million favorable impact from pricing and $253.0 million of shipment volume growth, partially offset by $233.2 million of higher cost of product sold and $40.7 million of unfavorable product mix. the higher cost of product sold is largely due to (i) $185.1 million of higher materials costs, including aluminum, glass, malt, cartons, lumber, corn, and steel, driven by inflation and supply chain constraints, (ii) a $42.5 million increase in brewery costs primarily driven by increased utilities, administrative costs, and maintenance, (iii) $40.7 million of higher depreciation, (iv) $34.1 million of increased transportation costs, and (v) $18.3 million of supporting costs, including increased compensation and benefits, it expenses, and travel, partially offset by (i) $71.9 million of decreased obsolescence primarily from excess inventory of hard seltzers resulting from a slowdown in the overall category in early fiscal 2022 and (ii) $26.8 million of favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels as compared to fiscal 2022.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents the decrease in wine and spirits gross profit is due to a decrease of $29.3 million from the 2022 wine divestiture, partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in organic gross profit. the increase in organic gross profit is driven by (i) $62.6 million of favorable product mix, (ii) $22.7 million of higher non-branded gross profit, (iii) a $5.0 million favorable foreign currency translation impact, and (iv) the $4.1 million favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by (i) a $78.8 million decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume and (ii) $7.0 million of higher cost of product sold, driven by inflation and global supply chain constraints. the increase in cost of product sold was largely attributable to (i) $30.5 million of increased transportation and warehousing costs, including ocean freight shipping, and (ii) $10.8 million of higher material costs, including glass and packaging materials, largely offset by (i) $22.3 million of net favorable fixed cost absorption and (ii) $12.0 million of cost saving initiatives, primarily resulting in lower grape costs.
gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 50.5% for fiscal 2023 compared with 53.4% for fiscal 2022. this decrease was largely due to (i) approximately 245 basis points of rate decline from cost of product sold within the beer segment, driven by the increase in operational and logistics costs, (ii) an unfavorable change of approximately 185 basis points in comparable adjustments, and (iii) approximately 30 basis points related to unfavorable product mix shift within the beer segment, partially offset by (i) approximately 135 basis points of favorable impact from beer pricing in select markets and (ii) favorable product mix shift and favorable impact from non-branded product within the wine and spirits segment, each contributing approximately 15 basis points.

the increase in beer selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily due to $54.7 million of higher marketing spend and $47.8 million of increased general and administrative expenses. the higher marketing spend was driven by increased sports-related partnerships and planned investments to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by (i) compensation and benefits, primarily related to incremental headcount to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio, (ii) higher travel and meeting costs as compared to fiscal 2022, and (iii) mexico beer projects strategic asset relocation, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact.
the decrease in wine and spirits selling, general, and administrative expenses is due to $20.3 million of lower marketing spend and a $6.2 million decrease in selling expenses, partially offset by $23.4 million of increased general and administrative expenses. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, primarily related to higher headcount from our continued focus on expanding into dtc channels and higher-end brands, higher travel as compared to fiscal 2022, and expenses associated with an initiative to improve our marketing effectiveness, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. for fiscal 2024, we expect marketing spend to be 8% of net sales.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents the increase in corporate operations and other selling, general, and administrative expenses is largely due to approximately (i) a $36 million increase in third-party services, primarily driven by our digital business acceleration investments, and (ii) a $9 million increase in compensation and benefits, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $8 million resulting from the completion of an erp implementation in fiscal 2022. the increase in compensation and benefits was primarily driven by (i) a fiscal 2022 reversal of stock-based compensation for a performance award tied to earnings from our investment in canopy that did not achieve a threshold level of performance and (ii) increased headcount to support our digital business acceleration initiative, partially offset by lower incentive accruals as compared to fiscal 2022.
selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 20.4% for fiscal 2023 as compared with 19.4% for fiscal 2022. the increase is driven largely by (i) an unfavorable change in comparable adjustments, contributing 75 basis points of rate growth and (ii) approximately 40 basis points of rate growth from the increase in the corporate operations and other segment's selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by approximately 25 basis points of rate decline as the increase in beer net sales exceeded the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

the increase in beer operating income is largely attributable to the favorable pricing impact, strong shipment volume growth within our mexican beer portfolio, decreased obsolescence, and favorable fixed cost absorption, partially offset by higher operational and logistics costs, marketing spend, and general and administrative expenses, as discussed above, and the unfavorable product mix shift.
the decrease in wine and spirits operating income is largely attributable to the decline in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, the 2022 wine divestiture, and increases in general and administrative expenses and cost of product sold, as described above, partially offset the favorable product mix shift, increase in non-branded net sales, lower marketing spend, and the favorable pricing impact.
as previously discussed, the corporate operations and other increase in operating loss is largely due to fiscal 2023 digital business acceleration investments and increased compensation and benefits, as discussed above, partially offset by the decrease in erp-related consulting services.

canopy segmentcanopy net sales decreased to $339.3 million for fiscal 2023 from $444.3 million for fiscal 2022. this decrease of $105.0 million, or 24%, is largely attributable to lower cannabis sales, partially offset by growth in their biosteel sports nutrition inc. business. the decline in cannabis sales primarily resulted from decreases in (i) canadian adult-use cannabis sales volume, largely driven by the continuing impacts of price compression resulting from increased competition, and (ii) medicinal sales driven by the january 2022 divestiture of c3, an international pharmaceutical business. additionally, other consumer products sales in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 decreased driven by declines in their storz &amp; bickel gmbh &amp; co. kg and this works products limited businesses. canopy gross profit (loss) decreased to $(125.7) million for fiscal 2023 from $(18.6) million for fiscal 2022. this decrease of $107.1 million is primarily driven by (i) a net increase in inventory write-downs and other charges associated with canopy's restructuring actions as compared to fiscal 2022, (ii) decreased net sales and price compression in the canadian adult-use channel, (iii) unfavorable product mix shift, and (iv) a decrease in payroll subsidies received from the canadian government in fiscal 2022 pursuant to a covid-19 relief program. canopy selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $1,368.7 million largely driven by a $1,353.2 million goodwill impairment related to their cannabis operations, restructuring costs, and asset impairments for fiscal 2023, partially offset by a continued focus on reducing costs and the closure of certain research and development facilities in fiscal 2022. the combination of these factors were the main contributors to the $1,475.8 million increase in operating loss.
interest expense interest expense increased to $398.7 million for fiscal 2023 as compared to $356.4 million for fiscal 2022. this increase of $42.3 million, or 12%, is due to higher average borrowings of approximately $775 million and approximately 20 basis points of higher weighted average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest in connection with the mexico beer projects. the higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates are largely attributable to the august 2022 term credit agreement and borrowings under our commercial paper program which was used to fund the aggregate cash payment to holders of class b stock in connection with the reclassification. for additional information, refer to notes 12 and 17.

(provision for) benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to $422.1 million for fiscal 2023 from $309.4 million for fiscal 2022. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 110.0% as compared with 99.7% for fiscal 2022. in comparison to prior year, our taxes were impacted primarily by:
•an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in canopy; and
•a higher income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for fiscal 2022 from changes in option exercise activity; partially offset by
•a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture; and
•the effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, including the impact of the fiscal 2022 long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress.
for additional information, refer to note 13.
we expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 18% to 20%. this range does not reflect any future changes in the fair value of our canopy investment measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) from the canopy equity method investment and related activities. on august 16, 2022, the ira was signed into law in the u.s. we do not currently expect the ira to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual effective tax rate and/or overall liquidity.
net income (loss) attributable to cbi net loss attributable to cbi increased to $71.0 million for fiscal 2023 from $40.4 million for fiscal 2022. this increase of $30.6 million, or 76%, is largely attributable to (i) the impairment of our canopy equity method investment, (ii) the increase in equity losses from canopy's results, and (iii) the increase in the provision for income taxes, partially offset by (i) the decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in canopy, (ii) the impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2022 in connection with certain assets at the mexicali brewery, and (iii) the improvements within the beer segment.
liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. we use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among other things.
we seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share constellation brands, inc. fy 2023 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 45

the reclassification required significant cash outlays during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. pursuant to the reclassification, each share of class b stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was reclassified, exchanged, and converted into one share of class a stock and received $64.64 in cash, without interest. the aggregate cash payment to holders of class b stock at the effective time was $1.5 billion. we utilized our $1.0 billion three-year term loan facility under the august 2022 term credit agreement and borrowings under our commercial paper program to fund the aggregate cash payment to holders of class b stock. in addition, we incurred $37.8 million of non-recurring costs and expenses for fiscal 2023 in connection with the completion of the reclassification. in february 2023, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the august 2022 term credit agreement with proceeds from the february 2023 senior notes. we do not expect the reclassification to have an ongoing material impact on our liquidity. for additional information, refer to note 17.
we have an agreement with a financial institution for payment services and began to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution during fiscal 2023. the program is available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program. our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. for additional information, refer to note 16.

investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2023 decreased to $999.4 million for fiscal 2023 from $1,035.8 million for fiscal 2022. this decrease of $36.4 million, or 4%, was primarily due to (i) $92.1 million of higher proceeds from sale of business, driven by the 2022 wine divestiture, and (ii) $16.4 million of lower business acquisitions, partially offset by $74.4 million from the sale of an investment made through our corporate venture capital function in fiscal 2022.

in april 2022, we entered into the 2022 restatement agreement that amended and restated the 2020 credit agreement. the 2022 restatement agreement resulted in (i) the refinance and increase of the existing revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and extension of its maturity to april 14, 2027, (ii) the refinement of certain negative covenants, and (iii) the replacement of libor rates with rates based on term sofr. there are no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 credit agreement.

general the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of february 28, 2023, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2024 to calendar 2050, and variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities under our april 2022 term credit agreement and august 2022 term credit agreement with calendar 2024 and 2025 maturity dates, respectively, as follows:
additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion of commercial paper, inclusive of a $250.0 million increase implemented in december 2022. our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 credit agreement. accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility.
we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 credit agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. we do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.

common stock dividends on april 5, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.89 per share of class a stock and $0.80 per share of class 1 stock payable on may 18, 2023, to stockholders of record of each class as of the close of business on may 4, 2023. we expect to return approximately $650 million to stockholders in fiscal 2024 through cash dividends.
we currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a. "risk factors" of this form 10-k.
share repurchase program our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our publicly traded common stock of up to $3.0 billion under the 2018 authorization and an additional repurchase of up to $2.0 billion under the 2021 authorization. the 2018 authorization was fully utilized as of may 31, 2022.
during fiscal 2023, we repurchased 7,086,446 shares of class a stock pursuant to the 2018 authorization and 2021 authorization at an aggregate cost of $1,700.2 million, excluding the impact of federal excise tax owed pursuant to the ira, or an average cost of $239.92 per share, through a combination of open market transactions and an asr. we primarily used cash on hand to pay the purchase price for the repurchased shares.

share repurchases under the 2021 authorization may be accomplished at management's discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. we may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. any repurchased shares will become treasury shares, including shares repurchased under the 2018 authorization and the 2021 authorization.
we currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a. "risk factors" of this form 10-k.
for additional information, refer to note 17.
capital resources we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

capital expenditures during fiscal 2023, we incurred $1,035.4 million for capital expenditures, including $813.9 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer projects. we plan to spend from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, including approximately $1 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer projects. the remaining planned fiscal 2024 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current and projected future business needs.
in april 2022, we announced that, with the assistance of the mexican government and state and local officials in mexico, we acquired land in veracruz for the construction of the veracruz brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. the design and construction process for the veracruz brewery is underway. see note 7 for further discussion.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1. certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. we review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. our critical accounting estimates include:
•equity method investments. we monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. we consider several factors when evaluating our investments, including, but not limited to, (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) operating and financial performance of the investee, (iii) the investee's future business plans and projections, (iv) recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, where available, (v) discussions with their management, and (vi) our ability and intent to hold the investment until it recovers in value.

part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents canopy equity method investment - monitored for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable.
as of february 28, 2022, the carrying value of our canopy equity method investment exceeded the fair value by $1,488.7 million. as of august 31, 2022, we evaluated the canopy equity method investment and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding canopy's stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended june 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of u.s. federal cannabis permissibility. as a result, the canopy equity method investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. the estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of august 31, 2022.
as of february 28, 2023, the carrying value of our canopy equity method investment exceeded the fair value by $87.4 million. if canopy's stock price does not recover above our c$3.84 carrying value in the near-term, there may be an additional impairment of our canopy equity method investment.
•fair value of financial instruments. management's estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and the availability of specific information. the fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:
canopy investment equity securities, warrants - estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model (level 2 fair value measurement) and monte carlo simulations (level 2 fair value measurement). these valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. we consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.
debt securities - estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. this valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.
•goodwill and other intangible assets. goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i) goodwill, (ii) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we may perform a qualitative evaluation prior to a quantitative test to determine if an impairment exists. however, if the results of the qualitative evaluation are inconclusive or suggest an impairment may exist, we must proceed to the quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including market conditions, industry changes, actual results as compared to forecasted results, or the timing of recent acquisitions and/or divestitures. the quantitative test estimates the fair value utilizing assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. the factors and assumptions used reflect management's estimates and are based on historical trends, projections, and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans; however, these are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or constellation brands, inc. fy 2023 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 53
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.
goodwill - our reporting units with goodwill include the beer segment and the wine and spirits segment. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. no indication of impairment was noted for either of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits reporting unit with approximately 26% excess fair value. for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2023, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit's net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value. therefore, we did not have any indication of potential impairment.
other intangible assets - our intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. using the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, certain continued negative trends within our funky buddha and four corners craft beer portfolios, including ongoing negative cash flows, resulted in management's decision to revise our long-term financial forecasts for these portfolios. accordingly, the beer segment's funky buddha and four corners craft beer businesses recognized $9.0 million and $4.0 million impairment losses, respectively, in connection with the write-off of their trademark assets. refer to note 7 for further discussion. additionally, in connection with our annual trademark analysis, we performed a quantitative assessment for the import beer, wine, and spirits trademarks and concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of these trademark units.
for fiscal 2022, as a result of our annual trademark impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our trademark units. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain negative trends within our four corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts indicating lower revenue and cash flow generation for the related portfolio. this change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the four corners trademark might be below its carrying value. accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. as a result of this assessment, the beer segment's four corners craft beer business recognized a $6.0 million impairment loss in connection with its trademark asset. refer to note 7 for further discussion.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the constellation brands, inc. fy 2023 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 54
part ii        item 7. md&amp;a        table of contents estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2023, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower, used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting's carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.
divestitures - when some, but not all of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of. the allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. this approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.
for fiscal 2023, our estimate of fair value for the 2022 wine divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transaction. the components sold were a part of the wine and spirits segment and were included in that reporting unit through the date of divestiture. goodwill was allocated to the assets based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the divestiture remained in the wine and spirits reporting unit.
for fiscal 2021, our estimate of fair value for the paul masson divestiture, the wine and spirits divestitures, the concentrate business divestiture, and the ballast point divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. the components sold were a part of the wine and spirits or beer segment and were included in those reporting units through the date of divestiture. goodwill was allocated to the assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the respective divestitures remained in the wine and spirits or beer reporting unit.
•accounting for income taxes. we estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, mexico, switzerland, the u.s., and other jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.
we believe all tax positions are fully supported. we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the fasb guidance for income tax accounting. accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent constellation brands, inc. fy 2023 form 10-k       #worthreachingfor i 55

change in accounting guidance accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2023 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

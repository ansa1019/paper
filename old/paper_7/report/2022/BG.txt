item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with "cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited, a bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. the commodity nature of the company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business, make volumes an important operating measure. accordingly, information is included in "segment overview and results of operations" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. the common unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons.
effective january 1, 2022, we changed our methodology for reporting volumetric data for our reportable segments to simplify and more closely align our volume reporting with our primary income-generating activities. the primary change comprises the elimination of grain and oilseed volumes originated from our suppliers. volumes are now reported as follows:
•in our agribusiness segment, reported processing volumes comprise oilseed volumes crushed (processed) during a period, which approximate sales volumes to third parties during the same period. reported merchandising volumes represent sales volumes to third party customers.
•refined and specialty oils segment volumes represent sales volumes to third party customers.
•milling segment volumes represent feedstock ground (processed) during a period, again approximating sales volumes during the same period.
•no volumes are reported for our sugar and bioenergy segment, which primarily comprises the company's net earnings from its 50% interest in bp bunge bioenergia, or our corporate and other activities, which have no material revenue-generating activities.
certain reclassifications of prior period volumes have been made to conform to current presentation. a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process, and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation, and logistics services. profitability in our processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed, and sold and by capacity utilization rates. availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting and selling decisions, plant diseases, governmental policies, and agricultural sector economic conditions. as noted above, reported processing volumes comprise oilseed volumes crushed (processed) during a period, which approximate sales volumes to third parties during the same period. reported merchandising volumes represent sales volumes to third party customers.
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita income, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. we also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when, and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.
additionally, price fluctuations and availability of commodities may cause fluctuations in our working capital, such as inventories, accounts receivable, and borrowings over the course of a given year. for example, increased availability of commodities at harvest times often causes fluctuations in our inventories and borrowings. increases in agricultural commodity table of contents prices will also generally cause our cash flow requirements to increase as our operations require increased use of cash to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange-traded futures that we use to hedge our physical inventories.
refined and specialty oils in the refined and specialty oils segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as crude vegetable oils, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions, and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the refined and specialty oils segment are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment. reported volumes in this segment reflect sales volumes to third party customers. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.
milling in the milling segment, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials such as grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita income, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the milling segment are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment. reported volumes in this segment reflect feedstock ground (processed) during a period, again approximating sales volumes during the same period. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials, which are their primary inputs.
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in bp bunge bioenergia, a joint venture with bp. bp bunge bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the southeast, north, and midwest regions of brazil. we account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. accordingly, our reported sugar and bioenergy results include our share of the net earnings in bp bunge bioenergia. while we are committed to supporting the growth and development of bp bunge bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture.
profitability of this segment, the value of our investment, and the timing of distributions we receive, if any, are affected by the profitability of the joint venture. in turn, the profitability of the joint venture is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impacts capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugar and ethanol. the availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the yield decreases with each subsequent harvest. as a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five to seven consecutive harvests, depending on location. the joint venture owns and/or has partnership agreements to manage farmland on which it grows and harvests sugarcane and also purchases sugarcane from third parties. prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana, the state of são paulo sugarcane, sugar, and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. demand for the joint venture's products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita income, and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane.
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:
foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. on a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the u.s. dollar, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into u.s. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. as a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the u.s. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (per quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
table of contents additionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange (losses) gains - net.
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. in contrast, foreign currency translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange (losses) gains - net.
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation. however, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 35%. the jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil, the united states, argentina, switzerland, and bermuda. determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. bunge also uses core segment ebit, non-core segment ebit and total segment ebit to evaluate the operating performance of bunge's core reportable segments, non-core reportable segments, and total reportable segments together with corporate and other. core segment ebit is the aggregate of the ebit of each of bunge's agribusiness, refined and specialty oils, and milling segments. non-core segment ebit is the ebit of bunge's sugar & bioenergy segment. total segment ebit is the aggregate of the ebit of bunge's core and non-core reportable segments, together with corporate and other. bunge's management believes core segment ebit, non-core segment ebit, and total segment ebit are useful measures of operating profitability since the measures allow for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industry. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. further, total segment ebit excludes ebit attributable to noncontrolling interests and is not a measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap. see the reconciliation of net income attributable to bunge to total segment ebit below.
cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is calculated by including the net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables with cash provided by (used for) operating activities. cash provided by (used for) operating activities, adjusted is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace cash provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. our management believes presentation of this measure allows investors to view our cash generating performance using the same measure that management uses in evaluating financial and business performance and trends.
2022 overview net income attributable to bunge - for the year ended december 31, 2022, net income attributable to bunge was $1,610 million, a decrease of $468 million compared to a net income attributable to bunge of $2,078 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to lower segment ebit in our core segments and corporate and other activities, as further discussed in the segment overview and results of operations section below, and increased interest expense.
earnings per common share - diluted - for the year ended december 31, 2022, net income attributable to bunge common shareholders, diluted, was $10.51 per share, a decrease of $3.13 per share, compared to $13.64 per share for the year ended december 31, 2021.
ebit - for the year ended december 31, 2022, total segment ebit was $2,331 million, a decrease of $330 million compared to ebit of $2,661 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in total segment ebit for the year ended december 31, 2022 was due to lower segment ebit in our core and non-core segments and corporate other other activities, as further discussed in the segment overview and results of operations section below, and which also provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to bunge to total segment ebit.
table of contents income tax expense - income tax expense was $388 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to income tax expense of $398 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by unfavorable earnings mix in our core and non-core segments.
liquidity and capital resources - at december 31, 2022, working capital, which equals total current assets less total current liabilities, was $7,158 million, an increase of $22 million, compared to working capital of $7,136 million at december 31, 2021. the slight increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in trade accounts receivable, which was primarily driven by increased net sales in the current period and changes to the securitization program, as discussed in note 5- trade accounts receivable and trade receivable securitization program, partially offset by lower net assets held for sale following the completion of the sale of our mexican wheat milling business and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt due to the reclassification from long-term debt of the current portion of our 1.85% senior notes, due 2023.
segment overview and results of operations our operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable segments based upon their similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. we further organize these reportable segments into core operations and non-core operations. core operations comprise our agribusiness, refined and specialty oils, and milling segments. non-core operations comprise our sugar & bioenergy segment, which itself primarily comprises the company's 50% interest in the net earnings of bp bunge bioenergia, a joint venture with bp p.l.c. ("bp").
our remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as corporate and other. corporate and other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reportable segments because the operating performance of each reportable segment is evaluated by the company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including bunge ventures, the company's captive insurance activities, and securitization program, as well as certain income tax assets and liabilities.

2022 compared to 2021
agribusiness segment net sales increased by $4,064 million, or 9%, to $47,700 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $43,636 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was due to the following:
•in processing, net sales increased $3,194 million primarily due to higher average sales prices in our soybean processing businesses across all regions and our european softseed processing business as well as higher sales volumes in north america. the price increases primarily resulted from higher global commodity prices following the onset of the ukraine-russia war, which exacerbated an already tight commodity supply environment. higher sales volumes in north america were driven by strong oil and meal demand. the above increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in our european oilseed processing and softseed processing businesses, primarily due to reduced activity at our ukrainian facilities as a result of the ukraine-russia war.
•in merchandising, net sales increased $870 million, primarily due to higher average sales prices in our global corn, wheat, and oil businesses, as a result of higher global commodity prices following the onset of the ukraine-russia war, which exacerbated an already tight commodity supply environment. these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in our global corn, wheat, and oil businesses, as a result of the ukraine-russia war, and the completion of the sale of a portfolio of grain elevators in the interior of the united states during the third quarter of 2021.
cost of goods sold increased by $4,277 million, or 10%, to $45,410 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $41,133 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to the following:
•in processing, cost of goods sold increased by $3,497 million due to higher average commodity prices, as noted in net sales above, increased industrial input costs, in particular energy, driven by inflationary pressures, unfavorable mark-to-market results, as well as $52 million in charges for losses sustained in relation to the ukraine-russia war, and $40 million of impairment charges related to the classification of our russian business as held-for-sale in the current year.
•in merchandising, cost of goods sold increased by $780 million due to higher average commodity prices, as noted in net sales above, and $28 million in charges for losses sustained in relation to the ukraine-russia war, partially offset by more favorable mark-to-market results, and lower volumes due to the completion of the sale of a portfolio of grain elevators in the interior of the united states during the third quarter of 2021.
gross profit decreased by $213 million, or 9%, to $2,290 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $2,503 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the following:
•in processing, a decrease of $303 million was due to higher cost of goods sold in excess of higher net sales, primarily driven by higher industrial input costs, in particular energy, due to inflationary pressures, unfavorable mark-to-market results, and certain non-recurring charges, as described above.

•in merchandising, an increase of $90 million was due to higher net sales in excess of higher cost of goods sold, primarily driven by strong execution and higher prices in our ocean freight business as well as more favorable mark-to-market results.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses increased $100 million, or 23%, to $532 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $432 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily driven by increased compensation costs and increased bad debt expense in the current period.
foreign exchange gains (losses) - net were a gain of $2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to a loss of $24 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the $2 million net gain in the current year was due to foreign exchange gains from our bunge financial services business, which is included in merchandising, partially offset by losses in our processing business driven by the impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar on u.s. dollar denominated loans payable in non-u.s. functional currency operations.
other (expense) income - net decreased $282 million, to expense of $67 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to income of $215 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to an $85 million mark-to-market loss on marketable securities and other short-term investments with exposures to ukraine, following the onset of the ukraine-russia war, as well as a $158 million prior year gain on the sale of a portfolio of interior grain elevators in the united states.
segment ebit decreased $575 million, or 25%, to $1,715 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $2,290 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the following:
•in processing, a decrease of $499 million was primarily due to lower gross profit, higher sg&a expense, lower other (expense) income - net, and lower foreign exchange results.
•in merchandising, a decrease of $76 million was primarily due to lower other (expense) income - net and higher sg&a expense, which more than offset higher gross profit and higher foreign exchange results.
2021 compared to 2020
agribusiness segment net sales increased by $13,589 million, or 45%, to $43,636 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $30,047 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was due to the following:
•in processing, net sales increased $7,125 million primarily due to significantly higher average sales prices in our soybean processing businesses in all regions, driven by higher commodity prices, and significantly higher average sales prices in our european softseed processing business.
•in merchandising, net sales increased $6,464 million primarily due to significantly higher average sales prices and volumes, primarily in our global corn, global oil and global wheat businesses, driven by higher commodity prices, and higher sales in our ocean freight business driven by increased global freight demand and related sales prices.
cost of goods sold increased by $12,948 million, or 46%, to $41,133 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $28,185 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the following:
•in processing, cost of goods sold increased by $6,492 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results in our global soybean processing businesses.
•in merchandising, cost of goods sold increased by $6,456 million due to higher global commodity prices and related sales as noted above, as well as increased industrial input costs driven by inflation, in particular energy, and unfavorable mark-to-market results, primarily in our ocean freight business.
gross profit increased by $641 million, or 34%, to $2,503 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $1,862 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the net increase was primarily due to the following:
•in processing, an increase of $633 million was due to higher net sales in excess of higher cost of goods sold, as a result of strong oil and meal demand leading to higher sales prices, coupled with favorable mark-to-market results, as described above.
•in merchandising, an increase of $8 million was due to higher net sales in excess of higher cost of goods sold, as higher average sales prices were partially offset by unfavorable mark-to-market results, as described above.

gross profit increased by $233 million, or 863%, to $260 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and price, in excess of related raw material cost increases, in our south american wheat milling business, as well as the cost of goods sold impact of a prior year non-recurring impairment charge of $170 million related to the classification of our mexican wheat milling business as held-for-sale.
sg&a expenses increased by $6 million, or 6%, to $102 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs, as well as higher costs in south america as a result of appreciation in the brazilian real versus the u.s. dollar during the year.

segment ebit increased by $199 million, or 229% to income of $112 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $87 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase is due to more favorable results from our investment in bp bunge bioenergia, driven by higher sugar and ethanol volumes and higher average sugar and ethanol sales prices in 2021, as well as a significant foreign exchange loss on u.s. dollar denominated debt of the joint venture due to a large depreciation in the brazilian real during 2020.

2021 compared to 2020
interest income increased $26 million to $48 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $22 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. interest expense decreased $22 million to $243 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $265 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower variable interest rates, as well as increased interest income primarily driven by the positive resolution of an historical value-added tax matter, during the year ended december 31, 2021.

cash and cash equivalents - cash and cash equivalents were $1,104 million at december 31, 2022, an increase of $202 million from $902 million at december 31, 2021. cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity, and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. cash balances are typically invested in short-term deposits with highly-rated financial institutions and in u.s. government securities. please refer to the cash flows section of this report, below, for details regarding the primary factors giving rise to the change in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december 31, 2022.
trade accounts receivable, net - trade accounts receivable, net were $2,829 million at december 31, 2022, an increase of $717 million from $2,112 million at december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to increased net sales in the current period driven by factors described in the segment overview & results of operations above and the restructuring of the trade receivables securitization program during the fourth quarter of 2022 that results in bunge retaining ownership in a population of unsold receivables, as discussed in note 5- trade accounts receivable and trade receivable securitization program, partially offset by an increase in the aggregate size of the trade receivables securitization program that occurred during the first quarter of 2022, as noted in note 5- trade accounts receivable and trade receivable securitization program.
inventories - inventories were $8,408 million at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $23 million from $8,431 million at december 31, 2021. the slight decrease was due to lower volumes, primarily driven by the ukraine-russia war, partially offset by higher average commodity prices relative to the prior year.
rmi comprises agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing

table of contents mechanisms. total rmi reported at fair value were $6,680 million and $6,869 million at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively (see note 6- inventories, to our consolidated financial statements).
other current assets - other current assets, including assets held for sale, were $4,417 million at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $598 million from $5,015 million at december 31, 2021. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in dpp as a result of restructuring our trade receivables securitization program during the fourth quarter of 2022 (see note 5- trade accounts receivable and trade receivable securitization program to our consolidated financial statements), a decrease in marketable securities and other short-term investments, due to a decrease in investments with ukrainian exposures following the onset of the ukraine-russia war, as well as a decrease in assets held for sale due to the completion of the sale of our mexico wheat milling business (see note 3- acquisitions and dispositions, to our consolidated financial statements), partially offset by an increase in margin deposits, prepaid commodity contracts, and income tax receivable.
short-term debt - short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was $1,392 million at december 31, 2022, an increase of $215 million from $1,177 million at december 31, 2021. the higher short-term debt level at december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021 is primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt associated with our 1.85% senior notes, due 2023, partially offset by lower short term debt used to fund working capital.
trade accounts payable - trade accounts payable were $4,386 million at december 31, 2022, an increase of $136 million from $4,250 million at december 31, 2021. the increase in trade accounts payable was primarily due to higher average inventory purchase prices during the current year as well as the timing of payments.
other current liabilities - other current liabilities, including liabilities held for sale, were $3,397 million at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $150 million from $3,547 million at december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to decreased unrealized losses on derivative contracts and a decrease in liabilities held for sale due to the completion of the mexico wheat milling disposition.
debt financing arrangements and outstanding indebtedness-we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company with efficient access to debt and capital markets. this structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which comprise intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries. certain of bunge limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp., bunge finance europe b.v., and bunge asset funding corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by bunge limited.
revolving credit facilities-at december 31, 2022, bunge had $6,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program, totaling $5,665 million with a number of financial institutions, in addition to $1,000 million in committed unsecured delayed draw term loans. the following table summarizes these facilities for the years presented:

short and long-term debt-our short and long-term debt decreased by $1,313 million at december 31, 2022 from december 31, 2021, primarily due to cash inflows from operations, including net proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables. these cash inflows helped to reduce the debt required to fund the increased working capital requirements throughout the year. for the year ended december 31, 2022, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $5,986 million compared to approximately $7,181 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. our long-term debt outstanding balance, including the current-portion of long-term debt, was $4,105 million at december 31, 2022 compared to $5,291 million at december 31, 2021.

our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt. however, credit rating downgrades would increase borrowing costs under our credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms. a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum current ratio, maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2022.
trade receivable securitization program bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the "program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the "purchasers") that provides for funding up to $1.1 billion against receivables sold into the program. bunge may also, from time to time with the consent of the administrative agent, request one or more of the existing committed purchasers or new committed purchasers to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. koninklijke bunge b.v., a wholly owned subsidiary of bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the program. the program is designed to enhance bunge's financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations.
on november 16, 2022, bunge and certain of its subsidiaries amended the program from a deferred purchase price ("dpp") structure to a pledge structure. under the new structure, a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, bunge securitization b.v. ("bsbv"), transfers certain trade receivables to the purchasers in exchange for a cash payment up to $1.1 billion and retains ownership of a population of unsold receivables. bsbv agrees to guaranty the collection of sold receivables and grants a lien to the administrative agent on all unsold receivables. collections on unsold receivables and guarantee payments are classified as operating activities in bunge's consolidated statements of cash flows.
the program terminates on may 17, 2031; however, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the program will terminate on may 17, 2025, unless extended for an additional period in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.
under the program's previous structure, bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables was limited to the dpp, included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see note 7- other current assets). the dpp was repaid in cash as receivables were collected, generally within 30 days. under the amended structure, bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is substantially the same and limited to the assets of bsbv, primarily comprised of unsold receivables pledged to the administrative agent. provisions for delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were zero, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively.
interest rate swap agreements we may use interest rate swaps in hedge accounting relationships and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. see note 17- derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements.

total bunge shareholders' equity was $9,224 million at december 31, 2022 compared to $7,669 million at december 31, 2021. the increase in bunge shareholders' equity during the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to $1,610 million of net income attributable to bunge, $247 million from sales of noncontrolling interest, recorded in additional paid-in capital, and $100 million of other comprehensive income, primarily driven by currency translation adjustments, partially offset by $362 million of declared dividends to common shareholders, and $200 million of common share repurchases.
noncontrolling interests increased to $732 million at december 31, 2022 from $156 million at december 31, 2021 primarily due to the reclassification of the remaining redeemable noncontrolling interest in loders to noncontrolling interests (refer to note 24- redeemable noncontrolling interest), the sale of noncontrolling interest during the period, primarily related to the creation of the bunge chevron jv (refer to note 1- nature of business, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies), and net income attributable to our noncontrolling interest entities, partially offset by dividends paid to noncontrolling interest holders.
cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares - on march 18, 2022, we announced all issued and outstanding shares of our 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares ("convertible preference shares") would automatically convert into common shares of the company, par value $0.01 per share, effective march 23, 2022 (the "conversion date"). on march 18, 2022, the closing price of the common shares of the company on the nyse was $104.91, marking the 20th trading day in the previous 30 trading days that the closing price of the common shares of the company exceeded 130% of the conversion price, triggering our right under the certificate of designation for the convertible preference shares, at our option, to mandatorily convert the convertible preference shares. the conversion price adjusted from $78.1322, per note 24 - equity included in the company's 2021 annual report on form 10-k, to $77.8482 on february 16, 2022.
each convertible preference share automatically converted into 1.2846 common shares of the company on the conversion date and cash was paid in lieu of fractional common shares of the company. there were 6,898,268 convertible preference shares issued and outstanding prior to the conversion, which resulted in the issuance of 8,861,515 new common shares of the company. additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, prior to the conversion, 1,415 convertible preference shares were voluntarily converted by preference shareholders into 1,816 common shares. as a result of the conversions, no convertible preference shares are issued or outstanding, and all rights of the former holders of the convertible preference shares terminated as of march 23, 2022.
share repurchase program - during october 2021, our board of directors approved a new program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our issued and outstanding common shares. the program has no expiration date. under this program, 2,109,115 common shares were repurchased for $200 million during the year ended december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, $300 million remains outstanding for repurchases under the program.

our cash flows from operations vary depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to the purchase and sale of our inventories.
2022 compared to 2021
for the year ended december 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash held for sale increased $247 million, compared to an increase of $524 million for the year ended december 31, 2021.
operating: cash used for operating activities was $5,549 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $2,655 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $2,894 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in cash used was primarily due to lower net income, increased cash required to fund working capital due to higher average commodity prices during the year ended december 31, 2022, and increased beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables driven by an increase in the size of the program in march 2022 as well as higher average commodity prices during the current year.

cash provided by operating activities, including net proceeds from beneficial interest in securitized trade receivables was $1,275 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $2,163 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was driven by lower net income as well as a substantial increase in cash used to fund working capital as a result of higher commodity prices during the year ended december 31, 2022.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar-denominated assets. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into u.s. dollars. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the u.s. are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. local currency loans in u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries outside the u.s. are remeasured into u.s. dollars at the exchange rate on the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange (losses) gains - net. for the year ended december 31, 2022 we recorded a foreign currency gain on net debt of $101 million versus a foreign currency loss on net debt for the year ended december 31, 2021 of $78 million, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange (gain) loss on net debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required as the gains and losses are non-cash items that arise from financing activities and therefore will have no impact on cash flows from operations.
table of contents investing: cash provided by investing activities was $6,499 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $5,113 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1,386 million. the increase was primarily due to higher net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables, driven by higher commodity prices and increased program capacity, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and lower proceeds received on the sale of our mexican wheat milling business during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to proceeds received from the sales of a portfolio of interior grain elevators located in the united states and our oils facilities in rotterdam and mexico during the year ended december 31, 2021.
financing: cash used for financing activities was $769 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $863 million, compared to cash used for financing activities of $1,632 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, for the year ended december 31, 2022, we made net cash repayments from short-term and long-term debt of $708 million, paid $349 million in dividend payments to common and preference shareholders, repurchased $200 million of common shares, and paid $102 million to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders in our subsidiary, bunge loders croklaan group b.v. (see note 24- redeemable noncontrolling interest). these cash outflows were partially offset by $542 million in cash received from the sale of noncontrolling interests, including upon formation of the bunge chevron jv, as described in note 1- nature of business, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies, and $92 million in proceeds from the exercise of options for common shares. for the year ended december 31, 2021, we made net cash repayments from short-term and long-term debt of $1,097 million, paid $147 million to acquire the noncontrolling equity interest of our polish subsidiary, z.t. kruszwica s.a, paid $323 million in dividends to our common and preference shareholders, paid $76 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders, and repurchased $100 million of common shares, partially offset by $116 million in cash received from the exercise of options for common shares.

certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar-denominated assets. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency, translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the u.s. are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. local currency loans in u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries outside the u.s. are remeasured into u.s. dollars at the exchange rate on the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded a foreign currency loss on net debt of $78 million versus a foreign currency gain on net debt for the year ended december 31, 2020 of $206 million, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by (used for) operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange (gain) loss on net debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required as these losses are non-cash items that arise from financing activities and therefore will have no impact on cash flows from operations.
table of contents investing: cash provided by investing activities was $5,113 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to $1,813 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $3,300 million. the increase was primarily due to higher net proceeds from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables as well as proceeds from the sales of our united states interior grain elevators and oils facilities in rotterdam and in mexico, partially offset by increased net payments for investments for the year ended december 31, 2021.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, net cash from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $5,057 million. we also generated proceeds from the divestiture of businesses and disposal of property, plant and equipment of $647 million driven by proceeds from the sales of our united states interior grain elevators and oils facilities in rotterdam and in mexico. in addition, we received proceeds from investments of $171 million, primarily promissory notes related to financial services investments, which were more than offset by payments of $308 million for such investments. we also made payments for capital expenditures of $399 million related to capital projects at various facilities. for the year ended december 31, 2020, cash from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables was $1,943 million. we also generated proceeds from the divestiture of businesses and disposal of property, plant and equipment of $194 million driven by proceeds from sales of our brazilian margarine and mayonnaise business and a u.s. rice mill. in addition, we received proceeds from investments of $305 million, primarily from promissory notes related to financial services investments, which were more than offset by payments of $337 million for such investments. we also made payments for capital expenditures of $365 million related to capital projects at various facilities.
financing: cash used for financing activities was $1,632 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $3,395 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,763 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, we made net cash repayments from short-term and long-term debt of $1,097 million, paid $147 million to acquire the noncontrolling equity interest of our polish subsidiary, z.t. kruszwica s.a., paid dividends of $323 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares, paid $76 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders of certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily loders, and repurchased $100 million of common shares. for the year ended december 31, 2020, net cash proceeds of short-term and long-term debt were $2,202 million, primarily used to fund seasonal working capital requirements, mostly comprising rmi. we also paid dividends of $316 million to our common shareholders and holders of our convertible preference shares and repurchased $100 million of common shares.
capital expenditures our cash payments made for capital expenditures were $555 million, $399 million, and $365 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we intend to make capital expenditures in the range of $800 million to $1 billion in 2023. our priorities for 2023 are to maintain the cash generating capacity of our assets through non-discretionary projects, such as maintenance, safety and compliance, as well as discretionary investments in growth and productivity projects, focusing on our strategy to strengthen our oilseeds platform, increase participation in biofuels and plant-based proteins, and grow our value-added oils business. these discretionary and non-discretionary capital investments will also help us achieve certain of our environmental and sustainability related objectives. we intend to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have issued or were party to the following guarantees at december 31, 2022:
(us$ in millions)                                   maximum potential future payments unconsolidated affiliates guarantee (1)                  $107

total                                                    $453
(1)we have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated affiliates. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. in addition, certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial table of contents institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced.
on november 21, 2022, one of our unconsolidated affiliates refinanced its third-party debt structure resulting in a significant reduction in our guarantee and potential liabilities to certain financial institutions from $181 million prior to the refinance to $46 million as of december 31, 2022.
based on the amounts drawn under guaranteed debt facilities of unconsolidated affiliates at december 31, 2022, our potential liability was $94 million, and less than $1 million of obligations related to these guarantees have been recorded within other non-current liabilities.
(2)we have issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars barges, and buildings. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2024 through 2029. at december 31, 2022, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. any obligation recorded would be recognized in current operating lease obligations or non-current operating lease obligations (see note 28- leases, to our consolidated financial statements).
we have provided a guaranty to the director of the illinois department of agriculture as trustee for bunge north america, inc. ("bna"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by bna, to grain producers and/or depositors in the state of illinois who have delivered commodities to bna's illinois facilities.

(1)includes components of long-term debt attributable to unamortized premiums of $20 million and excludes components of long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $341 million.
(2)represents future minimum payments under non-cancelable leases with initial terms of one year or more. minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $101 million due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases.
(3)represents purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and railroad freight lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. the ocean freight service agreements are short term contracts with a duration of less than a year. ocean freight service agreements with terms in excess of one year are included in non-cancelable lease obligations. the railroad freight service agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used. the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. however, changes in the market value of such freight services compared to the rates at which we have contracted them may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.
(4)represents other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.
(5)does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. as of december 31, 2022, bunge had uncertain income tax liabilities of $59 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we are table of contents unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. see note 15- income taxes to our consolidated financial statements.
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute $13 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $4 million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2023.
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1- nature of business, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form 10-k. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
foreign currency transactions and translation of foreign currency financial statements our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. the functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. the determination of functional currency may require significant judgment to identify the currency of the primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates. this may include an evaluation of a number of economic factors including, cash flow, sales price, sales market, expense, and financing indicators, as well, as the extent of the subsidiary's intra-entity transactions. however, in accordance with u.s. gaap, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then such foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting exchange gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange (losses) gains - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets.
at period-end, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
inventories and commodity derivatives our rmi, forward rmi purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. rmi are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs (see note 6- inventories to our consolidated financial statements for rmi balances as of december 31, 2022). we estimate the fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts on these inventories based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter ("otc") markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where our inventories are located. certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. the significant unobservable inputs for rmi and physically-settled forward purchase and sale contracts relate to certain management estimates regarding transportation costs and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight-related adjustments in the interior of brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in canada. in both situations, we use proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices to value freight, premiums, and discounts in our contracts. counterparty credit and performance risk on forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is included in the determination of fair value. from time to time, we have experienced instances of counterparty non-performance as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to movements in commodity prices between the time the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period. however, based on historical experience with our suppliers and customers, our own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, we do not view non-performance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of our forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.
table of contents changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income, respectively, could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and cost of goods sold could differ. see note 16- fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements for further details of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts on these inventories carried at fair value.
derivatives - designated hedging activities we manage currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges. assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative instruments has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of earnings in the statement of consolidated income in the same caption as the hedged items when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. if it is determined that the derivative hedging instruments are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of the derivative instrument would be recorded immediately in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. see note 17- derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for further details and impacts of cash flow hedges on the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill when we acquire a business, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market participants, projected growth rates, the amounts and timing of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to the cash flows, and the determination of useful life of an asset.
our goodwill balance is not amortized to expense. instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. we generally perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. if events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, we perform an impairment analysis at that date. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant asset. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) determine our reporting units; (2) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (3) determine the carrying value, or book value, of our reporting units; (4) estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge for such amount, but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis, including the identification of our reporting units, identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units, and determination of fair value. in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analysis, we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit aligned with management's strategic business plans. changes in judgment related to these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges. we believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate based on the information currently available to management. estimates based on market earnings multiples of peer companies identified for the reporting unit may also be used, where available. critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.
during the fourth quarters of 2022, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined the estimated fair values of each of our goodwill reporting units exceeded each of their carrying values by a significant amount. see note 9- goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements.
table of contents property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis. when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying values of these assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets from their use and ultimate disposal. if the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount that carrying value exceeds fair value. impairment is recognized as a charge against results of operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of these assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of these assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. please refer to note 11- impairments to our consolidated financial statements for details of property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in the year ended december 31, 2022.
investments in affiliates we have investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. we review our investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. during the fourth quarter of 2022, certain of the above factors indicated an other than temporary decline in value of our investments in two start-up manufacturers of novel protein ingredients, merit functional foods and australian plant proteins. we recognized an impairment to the extent the carrying value of each investment exceeded its fair value. critical estimates in the determination of the fair value include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair value, the amount of recorded impairment and the carrying value of our investments could differ. please refer to note 11- impairments and note 12- investments in affiliates and variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements for further details.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in brazil and non-income tax claims in argentina, and we make provisions for potential liabilities arising from such claims when we deem them probable and reasonably estimable. these estimates of probable loss have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 22- commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the amount of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing income tax expense. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income tax expense. during 2022, we decreased valuation allowances by $28 million primarily related to releases in jurisdictions where we believe realization of deferred tax assets is now more likely than not.
the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves complexities in the application of intricate tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. future changes in judgment related to the ultimate resolution of unrecognized tax benefits will affect the earnings in the quarter of such change. at december 31, 2022, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $59 million in our consolidated balance sheet. for additional information on income taxes, please refer to note 15- income taxes to our consolidated financial statements.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, raw materials and taxable services, as well as other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes, or other taxes we may owe, primarily in brazil and europe. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable table of contents taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payments by the applicable government agencies and the offset of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments, where permissible. at december 31, 2022, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $36 million. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.

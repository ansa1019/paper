item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations no registrant makes any representations as to the information related solely to centerpoint energy or the subsidiaries of centerpoint energy other than itself.
the following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein. when discussing centerpoint energy's consolidated financial information, it includes the results of houston electric and cerc, which, along with centerpoint energy, are collectively referred to as the registrants. where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such. unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to houston electric and cerc also pertain to centerpoint energy. in this combined form 10-k, the terms "our," "we" and "us" are used as abbreviated references to centerpoint energy, inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including houston electric and cerc, unless stated otherwise.
overview background centerpoint energy, inc. is a public utility holding company. centerpoint energy's operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution facilities, and provide energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services. for a detailed description of centerpoint energy's operating subsidiaries, please read note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
houston electric is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of centerpoint energy that provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ercot region and distribution service to reps serving the texas gulf coast area that includes the city of houston.
cerc corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of centerpoint energy that (i) directly owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in louisiana, minnesota, mississippi and texas, (ii) indirectly, through indiana gas and vedo, owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in indiana and ohio, respectively, and (iii) owns and operates permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through ceip.
centerpoint energy completed the restructuring on june 30, 2022, whereby the equity interests in indiana gas and vedo, both subsidiaries it acquired in its acquisition of vectren on february 1, 2019, were transferred from vuh to cerc corp. as a result, indiana gas and vedo became wholly owned subsidiaries of cerc corp. to better align centerpoint energy's organizational structure with management and financial reporting and to fund future capital investments more efficiently. the restructuring was a non-cash common control acquisition by cerc. as a result, cerc acquired these businesses at centerpoint energy's historical basis in these entities and prior year amounts were recast to reflect the restructuring as if it occurred at the earliest period presented for which centerpoint energy had common control. the restructuring did not impact centerpoint energy's carrying basis in any entity, its allocation of goodwill to its reporting units, or its segment presentation. neither centerpoint energy nor cerc recognized any gains or losses in connection with the restructuring. sigeco was not acquired by cerc and remains a subsidiary of vuh.
reportable segments in this management's discussion and analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our reportable segments, which are listed below. we also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these regulated segments. the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject, among other factors.
as of december 31, 2022, centerpoint energy's reportable segments were electric, natural gas, and corporate and other.
•the electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in houston electric's and indiana electric's service territories, as well as the impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility and energy delivery services to electric customers and electric generation assets to serve electric customers and optimize those assets in the wholesale power market in indiana electric's service territory. for further information about the electric reportable segment, see "business - our business - electric" in item 1 of part i of this report.
•the natural gas reportable segment includes (i) intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial, industrial and institutional customers in indiana, louisiana, minnesota, mississippi, ohio and texas; (ii) permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through ceip; and (iii) home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in minnesota and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in indiana, mississippi, ohio and texas through a third party. for further information about the natural gas reportable segment, see "business - our business - natural gas" in item 1 of part i of this report.
•the corporate and other reportable segment includes energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services and other corporate support operations that support centerpoint energy's business operations. centerpoint energy's corporate and other also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.
houston electric and cerc each consist of a single reportable segment.
executive summary we expect our businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. to the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
factors influencing our businesses and industry trends we are an energy delivery company with electric transmission and distribution, power generation, and natural gas distribution operations that serve more than seven million metered customers across six jurisdictions. the majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries.
in 2021, we announced strategic goals for our businesses, including our ten-year capital plan, and net zero and carbon emission reduction goals. our focus on the growth of our regulated utility businesses led to the previously announced enable merger in december 2021 and centerpoint energy's subsequent complete divestiture of its remaining energy transfer common units and energy transfer series g preferred units in february and march 2022. as a result of these transactions, over 95% of our earnings are now derived from regulated utility operations. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
pursuant to this business strategy and in light of the nature of our businesses, significant amounts of capital investment, as reflected in our current capital plan, which was increased in 2022 to fund additional investments in system resiliency, reliability, and grid modernization, is required. these investments are not only intended to meet our customers' current needs, but are also in anticipation for further organic growth and load growth from increased electrification in our service territories, including via increased electric vehicle adoption. to fund these capital investments, we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, cash proceeds from strategic transactions (such as the sale of our arkansas and oklahoma ldc businesses), and issuances of debt in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. disruptions in the financial markets along with rising interest rates can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. in those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. for that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.
the regulation of electric transmission, distribution and generation facilities as well as natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects centerpoint energy's, houston electric's and cerc's businesses. in accordance with applicable regulations, centerpoint energy, houston electric and cerc are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in their service territories under our capital plan to help operate and maintain a safer, more reliable and growing electric and natural gas systems. the current economic environment (e.g., increasing interest rates, higher relative levels of inflation in the united states) discussed further below could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny as these regulatory agencies seek to reduce the financial impact of utility bills on customers. this increased level of scrutiny could result in the disallowance (in part or in whole) of centerpoint energy and its subsidiaries from recovering on certain capital investments. centerpoint energy's, houston electric's and cerc's compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations. consequently, new rates in the areas they serve are necessary to recover these increasing costs. houston electric, indiana electric and cerc plan to file rate cases during 2023. the outcome of these base rate proceedings is uncertain and may be impacted by the current economic environment.
to assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors the recovery of costs and return on investments by the evaluation of net income and capital expenditures, among other things, from our regulated service territories within our reportable segments. within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, natural gas and fuel costs, interest expense, capital spend, working capital requirements, and operation and maintenance expense. in addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to gauge the performance of our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices, heating and cooling degree days, environmental impacts, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction.
each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint. for example, houston electric is largely concentrated in houston, a diverse economy where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. although the houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the various states our utility businesses serve. in minnesota, for instance, education and health services are the state's largest sectors. indiana and ohio are impacted by changes in the midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the midwest such as automotive, feed and grain processing. some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy. adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. long-term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. to the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. management expects residential meter growth for houston electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the natural gas reportable segment is approximately 1%. management expects residential meter growth for cerc to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 1%.
rising inflation and interest rates and a recessionary environment could potentially adversely impact centerpoint energy's ability to execute on its 10-year capital plan. the inability to execute on our capital plan may result in lost future revenues for centerpoint energy. additionally, these economic conditions may affect customers' ability to pay their utility bills which may preclude our ability to collect balances due from such customers.
further, the global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as labor shortages, resource availability, long lead times, inflation and weather. these disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. like many of our peers, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain and may continue to experience such disruptions in the future. for example, we, along with the developer of the project, announced plans in january 2022 to downsize the solar array to be built in posey county, indiana due to supply chain issues experienced in the energy industry, rising cost of commodities and community feedback. to the extent adverse economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, affect our suppliers and customers as well as our ability to meet our capital plan and generation transition plan, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. for more information, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
further, in response to concerns for protecting the environment, we have strived to take a leading stance in the transition to safer and cleaner energy by being the first combined electric and natural gas utility with regulated generation assets to adopt net zero for its scope 1 and certain scope 2 ghg emissions by 2035 goals. in addition, we set a scope 3 ghg emission reduction goal across our multi-state footprint by committing to help our residential and commercial customers reduce ghg emissions attributable to their end use of natural gas by 20% to 30% by 2035 from a 2021 baseline. our capital plan supports these goals.
significant events regulatory proceedings. the commissioners of the mpuc held deliberations in august 2022 regarding cerc's natural gas cost prudency review case related to the february 2021 winter storm event. as a result, the mpuc disallowed recovery of approximately $36 million of jurisdictional gas costs incurred during the event (or about 8.7% of the total of such costs incurred by cerc) and cerc's regulatory asset balance was reduced to reflect the disallowance. houston electric filed its dcrf application with the puct on april 5, 2022, and subsequently amended such filing on july 1, 2022 to show mobile generation in a separate rider teeef, seeking recovery of deferred costs and the applicable return as of december 31, 2021 under these lease agreements of approximately $200 million. the annual revenue increase requested for these lease agreements is approximately $57 million. on january 27, 2023, the administrative law judges issued a proposal for decision recommending that the leasing of the teeef was not prudent or reasonable and necessary and that the puct deny recovery of all of the teeef costs. the puct is expected to consider the proposal for decision on march 9, 2023. for further information, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. for information related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings to date in 2022 and to date in 2023, see "-liquidity and capital resources -regulatory matters" below.
debt transactions. in 2022, houston electric issued $1.6 billion, and cerc issued or borrowed $1.0 billion in new debt, excluding the debt exchanges discussed below. centerpoint energy repaid or redeemed a combined $1.53 billion of debt, including cerc's redemption of $425 million of debt and cehe's redemption of $500 million of debt, but excluding scheduled principal payments on securitization bonds. for information about debt transactions in 2022, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
debt exchange. as a part of the restructuring, on may 27, 2022, cerc corp. and vuh completed an exchange with holders of vuh ppns whereby cerc corp. issued new senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $302 million in return for all of their outstanding vuh ppns with an aggregate principal amount of $302 million. on october 5, 2022, in connection with the settlement of an exchange offer, cerc corp. issued $75 million aggregate principal amount of 6.10% senior notes due 2035 in exchange for all remaining outstanding vuh senior notes. for additional information, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring. centerpoint energy completed the restructuring on june 30, 2022, whereby the equity interests in indiana gas and vedo, each of which were acquired in its acquisition of vectren on february 1, 2019, were transferred from vuh to cerc corp. as a result, indiana gas and vedo became wholly owned subsidiaries of cerc corp. to better align centerpoint energy's organizational structure with management and financial reporting and to fund future capital investments more efficiently. for additional information, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
credit facilities. on december 6, 2022, centerpoint energy, inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, houston electric and cerc, replaced their existing revolving credit facilities with three revolving credit facilities totaling $3.75 billion in aggregate commitments. in addition, sigeco entered into a new revolving credit facility totaling an additional $250 million in aggregate commitments. the aggregate amount of commitments among the four credit facilities total $4.0 billion. on june 30, 2022, in connection with the restructuring, vuh repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all remaining commitments and other obligations under its $400 million amended and restated credit agreement dated as of february 4, 2021. for additional information, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
sale of energy transfer equity securities. in 2022, centerpoint energy sold its remaining energy transfer common units and energy transfer series g preferred units for net proceeds of $702 million. for more information, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
sale of natural gas businesses. on january 10, 2022, cerc corp. completed the sale of its arkansas and oklahoma natural gas businesses. for additional information regarding discontinued operations and divestitures, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

centerpoint energy completed the restructuring on june 30, 2022, whereby the equity interests in indiana gas and vedo, both subsidiaries it acquired in its acquisition of vectren on february 1, 2019, were transferred from vuh to cerc corp. as a result, indiana gas and vedo became wholly owned subsidiaries of cerc corp. the restructuring was a non-cash common control acquisition by cerc. as a result, cerc acquired these businesses at centerpoint energy's historical basis in these entities and prior year amounts were recast to reflect the restructuring as if it occurred at the earliest period presented for which centerpoint energy had common control.

indiana electric cpcn (centerpoint energy)
btas on february 23, 2021, indiana electric filed a cpcn with the iurc seeking approval to purchase the posey solar project. on october 27, 2021, the iurc issued an order approving the cpcn, authorizing indiana electric to purchase the posey solar project through a bta to acquire its solar array assets for a fixed purchase price and approved recovery of costs via a levelized rate over the anticipated 35-year life. due to community feedback and rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, indiana electric, along with arevon, the developer, announced plans in january 2022 to downsize the posey solar project to 191 mw. indiana electric collaboratively agreed to the scope change, and on february 1, 2023, indiana electric entered into an amended and restated bta that is contingent on further iurc review and approval. on february 7, 2023, indiana electric filed a cpcn with the iurc to approve the amended bta. with the passage of the ira, indiana electric can now pursue ptcs for solar projects. indiana electric will request that project costs, net of ptcs, be recovered in rate base rather than a levelized rate, through base rates or the ceca mechanism, depending on which provides more timely recovery. the posey solar project is expected to be placed in service in 2025.
on july 5, 2022, indiana electric entered into a bta to acquire a 130 mw solar array in pike county, indiana through a special purpose entity for a capped purchase price. a cpcn for the project was filed with the iurc on july 29, 2022. on september 21, 2022, an agreement in principle was reached resolving all the issues between indiana electric and oucc. the stipulation and settlement agreement was filed on october 6, 2022 and a settlement hearing was held on november 1, 2022. on january 11, 2023, the iurc issued an order approving the settlement agreement granting indiana electric to purchase and acquire the pike county solar project through a bta and approved the estimated cost. the iurc also designated the project as a clean energy project under ind. code ch. 8-1-8.8, approved the proposed levelized rate and associated ratemaking and accounting treatment. the project is expected to be placed in service by the first quarter of 2025.
on january 10, 2023, indiana electric filed a cpcn with the iurc to acquire a wind energy generating facility through a bta, consistent with its 2019/2020 irp that calls for up to 300 mws of wind generation. the wind project is located in miso's central region. the construction phase is expected to commence during the second half of 2023 to achieve commercial operation by january 1, 2025. indiana electric has requested recovery via the ceca mechanism or through base rates in the next general rate case, depending on which provides more timely recovery. as of the date of this form 10-k, indiana electric has not entered into any definitive agreement relating to this wind energy generating facility, and it is not certain that a definitive agreement will be entered into at all.
ppas indiana electric also sought approval in february 2021 for a 100 mw solar ppa with clenera llc in warrick county, indiana. the request accounted for increased cost of debt related to this ppa, which provides equivalent equity return to offset imputed debt during the 25 year life of the ppa. in october 2021, the iurc approved the warrick county solar ppa but denied the request to preemptively offset imputed debt in the ppa cost. due to rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, clenera and indiana electric were compelled to renegotiate terms of the agreement to increase the ppa price. on january 17, 2023, indiana electric filed a request with the iurc to amend the previously approved ppa with certain modifications. revised purchase power costs are requested to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended ppa. the amended ppa will be brought before the iurc in a fully docketed proceeding in the second quarter of 2023. the clenera solar array is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2025.
on august 25, 2021, indiana electric filed with the iurc seeking approval to purchase 185 mw of solar power, under a 15-year ppa, from oriden, which is developing a solar project in vermillion county, indiana, and 150 mw of solar power, under a 20-year ppa, from origis, which is developing a solar project in knox county, indiana. on may 4, 2022, the iurc issued an order approving indiana electric to enter into both ppas. in march 2022, when the results of the miso interconnection study were completed, origis advised indiana electric that the costs to construct the solar project in knox county, indiana had increased. the increase was largely driven by escalating commodity and supply chain costs impacting manufacturers worldwide. in august 2022, indiana electric and origis entered into an amended ppa, which reiterated the terms contained in the 2021 ppa with certain modifications. on october 19, 2022, indiana electric filed with the iurc seeking approval of the amended ppa with origis and a hearing was held on january 4, 2023. on january 17, 2023, indiana electric filed a request with the iurc to amend the previously approved ppa with oriden with certain modifications. revised purchase power costs are requested to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended ppa with oriden. the amended ppa with oriden will be brought before the iurc in a fully docketed proceeding in the second quarter of 2023. the oriden solar array is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2025 and the origis solar array is expected to be placed in service by the third quarter of 2024.
natural gas combustion turbines on june 17, 2021, indiana electric filed a cpcn with the iurc seeking approval to construct two natural gas combustion turbines to replace portions of its existing coal-fired generation fleet. on june 28, 2022, the iurc approved the cpcn. the estimated $334 million turbine facility is planned to be constructed at the current site of the a.b. brown power plant in posey county, indiana and would provide a combined output of 460 mw. indiana electric received approval for depreciation expense and post in-service carrying costs to be deferred in a regulatory asset until the date indiana south's base rates include a return on and recovery of depreciation expense on the facility. a new approximately 23.5 mile pipeline will be constructed and operated by texas gas transmission, llc to supply natural gas to the turbine facility. ferc granted a certificate to construct the pipeline on october 20, 2022. the period to challenge ferc's certificate in a federal district court expires on february 20, 2023. indiana electric granted its contractor a full notice to proceed to construct the turbines on december 9, 2022. the facility is targeted to be operational by year end 2025. recovery of the proposed natural gas combustion turbines and regulatory asset will be requested in the next indiana electric rate case expected in 2023.

minnesota legislation (centerpoint energy and cerc)
the natural gas innovation act was passed by the minnesota legislature in june 2021 with bipartisan support. this law establishes a regulatory framework to enable the state's investor-owned natural gas utilities to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing the state's clean energy future. specifically, the natural gas innovation act allows a natural gas utility to submit an innovation plan for approval by the mpuc which could propose the use of renewable energy resources and innovative technologies such as:
•renewable natural gas (produces energy from organic materials such as wastewater, agricultural manure, food waste, agricultural or forest waste);
•renewable hydrogen gas (produces energy from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity such as solar);
•energy efficiency measures (avoids energy consumption in excess of the utility's existing conservation programs); and
•innovative technologies (reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions using technologies such as carbon capture).
cerc expects to submit its first innovation plan to the mpuc in 2023. the maximum allowable cost for an innovation plan will start at 1.75% of the utility's revenue in the state and could increase to 4% by 2033, subject to review and approval by the mpuc.
solar panel issues (centerpoint energy)
centerpoint energy's current and future solar projects have been impacted by delays and/or increased costs. the potential delays and inflationary cost pressures communicated from the developers of our solar projects are primarily due to (i) unavailability of solar panels and other uncertainties related to the pending doc investigation on anti-dumping and countervailing duties petition filed by a domestic solar manufacturer, (ii) the december 2021 uyghur forced labor prevention act on solar modules and other products manufactured in china's xinjiang uyghur autonomous region and (iii) persistent general global supply chain and labor availability issues. on december 2, 2022, the doc issued its preliminary determination, finding four of the eight companies being investigated are attempting to bypass u.s. duties; however, the investigation continues with the doc's final determination, which is currently scheduled for may 2023. in june 2022, president biden authorized an executive order which would suspend anti-circumvention tariffs on solar panels for two years; however, the executive order could be subject to legal challenges and its effects remain uncertain. the resolution of these issues will determine what additional costs or delays our solar projects will be subject to. these impacts have resulted in cost increases for certain projects, and may result in cost increases in other projects, and such impacts have resulted in, or are expected to result in, the need for us to seek additional regulatory review and approvals. additionally, significant changes to project costs and schedules as a result of these factors could impact the viability of the projects. for more information regarding potential delays, cancellations and supply chain disruptions, see "item 1a. risk factors- risk factors affecting operations - electric generation, transmission and distribution - increases in the cost or..." in this report.

inflation reduction act (ira)
on august 16, 2022, the ira was signed into law. the new law extends or creates tax-related energy incentives for solar, wind and alternative clean energy sources, implements, subject to certain exceptions, a 1% tax on share repurchases after december 31, 2022, and implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on the afsi of those corporations with an average afsi of $1 billion over the most recent three-year period. the ira did not have a material impact on the registrants' 2022 financial results and no material impact is expected for 2023 financial results. further guidance on the tax provisions of the ira is expected and the registrants continue to evaluate the ira provisions for the effect on their future financial results.
greenhouse gas regulation and compliance (centerpoint energy)
on august 3, 2015, the epa released its cpp rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. the final rule was published in the federal register on october 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the u.s. supreme court staying implementation of the rule. on july 8, 2019, the epa published the ace rule, which (i) repealed the cpp rule; (ii) replaced the cpp rule with a program that requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units; and (iii) amended the implementing regulations for section 111(d) of the clean air act. on january 19, 2021, the majority of the ace rule - including the cpp repeal, cpp replacement, and the timing-related portions of the section 111(d) implementing rule - was struck down by the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit and on october 29, 2021, the u.s. supreme court agreed to consider four petitions filed by various coal interests and a coalition of 19 states. on june 30, 2022, the u.s. supreme court ruled that the epa exceeded its authority in promulgating the cpp. the epa has announced it plans on issuing new greenhouse gas rules in the future.
the biden administration recommitted the united states to the paris agreement, which can be expected to drive a renewed regulatory push to require further ghg emission reductions from the energy sector and proceeded to lead negotiations at the global climate conference in glasgow, scotland. on april 22, 2021, president biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide ghg emissions, and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the u.s. commitments announced in glasgow. in september 2021, centerpoint energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both scope 1 and certain scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce certain scope 3 emissions by 20% to 30% by 2035. because texas is an unregulated market, centerpoint energy's scope 2 estimates do not take into account texas electric transmission and distribution assets in the line loss calculation and, in addition, exclude emissions related to purchased power in indiana between 2024 and 2026 as estimated. centerpoint energy's scope 3 estimates are based on the total natural gas supply delivered to residential and commercial customers as reported in the u.s. energy information administration (eia) form eia-176 reports and do not take into account the emissions of transport customers and emissions related to upstream extraction. these emission goals are expected to be used to position centerpoint energy to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from the current and future administrations to further reduce ghg emissions. centerpoint energy's and cerc's revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. the ira established the methane emissions reduction program, which imposes a charge on methane emissions from certain natural gas transmission facilities, and the epa has proposed new regulations targeting reductions in methane emissions, which if implemented will increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. houston electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including indiana electric, does not generate electricity, other than teeef, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. centerpoint energy's net zero emissions goals are aligned with indiana electric's generation transition plan and are expected to position indiana electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements related to ghg emissions reductions. nevertheless, houston electric's and indiana electric's revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within their respective service territories. likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the registrants' services. for example, minnesota has enacted the natural gas innovation act that seeks to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing ghg emissions. further, certain local government bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain specified dates. for example, minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. additionally, cities in minnesota within centerpoint energy's natural gas operational footprint are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in buildings and focus on electrification. also, minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. these initiatives could have a significant impact on centerpoint energy and its operations, and this impact could increase if other cities and jurisdictions in its service area enact similar initiatives. further, our third party suppliers, vendors and partners may also be impacted by climate change laws and regulations, which could impact centerpoint energy's business by, among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to centerpoint energy. conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to benefit centerpoint energy and cerc and their natural gas-related businesses. at this time, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions, either positive or negative, on the registrants' businesses.
compliance costs and other effects associated with climate change, reductions in ghg emissions and obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. although the amount of compliance costs remains uncertain, any new regulation or legislation relating to climate change will likely result in an increase in compliance costs. while the requirements of a federal or state rule remain uncertain, centerpoint energy will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding ghg emission standards that may affect its business. currently, centerpoint energy does not purchase carbon credits. in connection with its net zero emissions goals, centerpoint energy is expected to purchase carbon credits in the future; however, centerpoint energy does not currently expect the number of credits, or cost for those credits, to be material.
climate change trends and uncertainties as a result of increased awareness regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for the registrants' services. as these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of the registrants' systems and services, which may result in, among other things, indiana electric's generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels have had significant impacts on centerpoint energy's electric generation and natural gas businesses. for example, because indiana electric's current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in centerpoint energy's financing arrangements. conversely, demand for the registrants' services may increase as a result of customer changes in response to climate change. for example, as the utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of centerpoint energy's systems and services. any negative opinions with respect to centerpoint energy's environmental practices or its ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors, legislators or other stakeholders could harm its reputation.
to address these developments, centerpoint energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both scope 1 and certain scope 2 emissions by 2035. indiana electric's 2019/2020 irp identified a preferred portfolio that retires 730 mw of coal-fired generation facilities and replaces these resources with a mix of generating resources composed primarily of renewables, including solar, wind, and solar with storage, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation. indiana electric continues to execute on its 2019/2020 irp and has received initial approvals for 756 mws of the 700-1,000 mws identified within indiana electric's 2019/2020 irp. additionally, as reflected in its 10-year capital plan announced in september 2021, centerpoint energy anticipates spending over $3 billion in clean energy investments and enablement, which may be used to support, among other things, renewable energy generation and electric vehicle expansion. centerpoint energy believes its planned investments in renewable energy generation and corresponding planned reduction in its ghg emissions as part of its net zero emissions goals support global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. for more information regarding centerpoint energy's net zero emission goals and the risks associated with them, see "risk factors - risk factors affecting regulatory, environmental and legal risks - centerpoint energy is subject to operational and financial risks..."
to the extent climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the registrants' service territories, financial results from the registrants' businesses could be adversely impacted. for example, centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. on the other hand, warmer temperatures in centerpoint energy's and houston electric's electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity used for cooling. another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding, including such storms as the february 2021 winter storm event. since many of the registrants' facilities are located along or near the texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. centerpoint energy's current 10-year capital plan includes capital expenditures to maintain reliability and safety and increase resiliency of its systems as climate change may result in more frequent significant weather events. houston electric does not own or operate any electric generation facilities other than, since september 2021, its operation of teeef. houston electric transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. to the extent adverse weather conditions affect the registrants' suppliers, results from their energy delivery businesses may suffer. for example, in texas, the february 2021 winter storm event caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to houston electric's service territory and the wholesale generation market and also caused a reduction in available natural gas capacity. when the registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the registrants' financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. to the extent the registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the registrants' future financial results may be adversely impacted. further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events continues, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance.
other matters credit facilities the registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop centerpoint energy's and cerc's commercial paper programs. the facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. for further details related to the registrants' revolving credit facilities, please see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
on june 30, 2022, in connection with the restructuring, vuh repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all remaining commitments and other obligations under its $400 million amended and restated credit agreement dated as of february 4, 2021. vuh did not incur any penalties in connection with the early termination.

(1)a moody's rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer's rating over the medium term.
(2)an s&p outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term.
(3)a fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period.
the registrants cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. the registrants note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the registrants' securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the registrants' credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the registrants' ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the registrants' commercial strategies.
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the registrants' revolving credit facilities. if the registrants' credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by s&p and moody's from the ratings that existed as of december 31, 2022, the impact on the borrowing costs under the four revolving credit facilities would have been insignificant. a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the registrants' ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas reportable segments.
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper's guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody's and s&p, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months' charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. if the credit ratings of cerc corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, cerc might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $237 million as of december 31, 2022. the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.
zens and securities related to zens (centerpoint energy)
if centerpoint energy's creditworthiness were to drop such that zens holders thought its liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens were to become illiquid, some zens holders might decide to exchange their zens for cash. funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of zens-related securities that centerpoint energy owns or from other sources. centerpoint energy owns shares of zens-related securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the zens. zens exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens and shares of zens-related securities would typically cease when zens are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of zens-related securities are sold. the ultimate tax liability related to the zens and zens-related securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the zens. if all zens had been exchanged for cash on december 31, 2022, deferred taxes of approximately $665 million would have been payable in 2022. if all the zens-related securities had been sold on december 31, 2022, capital gains taxes of approximately $80 million would have been payable in 2022 based on 2022 tax rates in effect. for additional information about zens, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
cross defaults under each of centerpoint energy's, houston electric's and cerc's respective revolving credit facilities and cerc's term loan agreement, a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125 million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower's respective credit facility or term loan agreement. under sigeco's revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specific types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $75 million by sigeco or any of its significant subsidiaries will cause a default under sigeco's credit facility. a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries' debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.
possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures from time to time, the registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. the registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. as announced in september 2021, and updated in november 2022, centerpoint energy has increased its planned capital expenditures in its electric and natural gas businesses to support rate base growth and may explore asset sales, in addition to the completed sale of its natural gas businesses located in arkansas and oklahoma, as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures. for further information, see note 4.
hedging of interest expense for future debt issuances from time to time, the registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the u.s. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. for further information, see note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements.
collection of receivables from reps (centerpoint energy and houston electric)
houston electric's receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity houston electric distributes to their customers. before conducting business, a rep must register with the puct and must meet certain financial qualifications. nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for houston electric's services or could cause them to delay such payments. houston electric depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect houston electric's cash flows. in the event of a rep's default, houston electric's tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for houston electric to request that the puct suspend or revoke the certification of the rep. applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments. however, houston electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort. if a rep were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against houston electric involving payments it had received from such rep. if a rep were to file for bankruptcy, houston electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy. however, puct regulations authorize utilities, such as houston electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.
other factors that could affect cash requirements in addition to the above factors, the registrants' liquidity and capital resources could also be negatively affected by:
•cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of centerpoint energy's and cerc's natural gas reportable segment;
•acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices, and concentration of natural gas suppliers (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans or the use of alternative sources of financings on capital and other financial markets;
•various legislative or regulatory actions;
•incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (centerpoint energy);
•the ability of reps, including rep affiliates of nrg and vistra energy corp., to satisfy their obligations to centerpoint energy and houston electric;
•slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices, changing economic conditions, public health threats or severe weather events (centerpoint energy and cerc);
•the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;
•the outcome of litigation, including litigation related to the february 2021 winter storm event;
•contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and
•various other risks identified in "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
certain contractual limits on our ability to issue securities and borrow money certain provisions in certain note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by cerc have the effect of restricting the amount of secured debt issued by cerc and debt issued by subsidiaries of cerc corp. additionally, houston electric and sigeco are limited in the amount of mortgage bonds they can issue by the general mortgage and sigeco's mortgage indenture, respectively. for information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the registrants' and sigeco's revolving credit facilities, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the registrants' financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. accounting estimates in the registrants' historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. the accounting estimates described below require the registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. additionally, different estimates that the registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. the registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the registrants' operating environment changes. the registrants' significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. the registrants believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of centerpoint energy's board of directors.
accounting for rate regulation accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. centerpoint energy, for its electric and natural gas reportable segments, houston electric and cerc apply this accounting guidance. certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. for example, during 2022, the mpuc disallowed recovery of approximately $36 million of jurisdictional gas costs incurred during the february 2021 winter storm event and cerc's regulatory asset balance was reduced when such amounts were no longer probable of recovery. for further detail on the registrants' regulatory assets and liabilities, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles and goodwill the registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles and goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles and goodwill, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters could result in an impairment charge. the registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles or goodwill during 2022 and 2021. during 2020, centerpoint energy recognized goodwill impairment losses as discussed further in notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses, such as for energy systems group, requires the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests.
annual goodwill impairment test centerpoint energy and cerc completed their 2022 annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 and determined, based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches, that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. the fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.
although no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2022 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if centerpoint energy's market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.
common control transactions (centerpoint energy and cerc)
when accounting for a transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets or the equity interests shall initially recognize the assets and liabilities transferred at the date of transfer based on the ultimate parent company's basis, which in the case of the restructuring is centerpoint energy's basis. centerpoint energy's basis in net assets of an entity may differ from the historical net assets of that entity on a standalone basis, for example, because push-down accounting had not been applied on a standalone basis. additionally, when the net assets transferred in a common-control transaction meet the definition of a business, the receiving entity will record an allocation of goodwill from the reporting unit based on the relative fair value of the businesses transferred within that reporting unit. as a result, on june 30, 2022, cerc received $972 million of goodwill from centerpoint energy's natural gas reporting unit in connection with the restructuring. cerc recast prior periods to reflect the restructuring as if it occurred at the earliest period presented for which centerpoint energy had common control. the restructuring did not impact centerpoint energy's basis in any entity, its allocation of goodwill to its reporting units, or its segment presentation. neither centerpoint energy nor cerc recognized any gains or losses in connection with the restructuring. sigeco was not acquired by cerc and remains a subsidiary of vuh.
fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value could be different if different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques were applied.
fair value measurements require significant judgment and often depend on unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amounts of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the resulting fair value or relative fair value.
the fair value of the businesses within the natural gas reporting unit was estimated based on a weighted combination of income and market approaches, consistent with the methodology used in the 2021 annual goodwill impairment test (the most recent annual test completed at the time of the transaction).
assets held for sale and discontinued operations generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the board of directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. the registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. if a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business. a disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the registrant is also reflected as discontinued operations on the statements of consolidated income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.
for further information, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
unbilled revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. however, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings. at the end of each month, deliveries to non-ams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data. unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. as additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
pension and other retirement plans centerpoint energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. centerpoint energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. these factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. in addition, centerpoint energy's actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. please read "- other significant matters - pension plans" for further discussion.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2(u) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the registrants.
other significant matters pension plans (centerpoint energy).  as discussed in note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, centerpoint energy maintains non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. employer contributions for the qualified plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.
under the terms of centerpoint energy's pension plans, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. centerpoint energy's funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa.
additionally, centerpoint energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.
centerpoint energy's funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

although centerpoint energy's minimum contribution requirement to the qualified pension plans in 2023 is zero, it expects to make contributions aggregating up to $50 million. centerpoint energy expects to make contributions aggregating approximately $7 million to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans in 2023.
changes in pension obligations and plan assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in centerpoint energy's statements of consolidated income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. as such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.
as the sponsor of a plan, centerpoint energy is required to (a) recognize on its consolidated balance sheet an asset for the plan's over-funded status or a liability for the plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.
the projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. this decrease was primarily due to increases in discount rates, as well as the impact of lump sum settlement payments.
in december 2022, the centerpoint energy pension plan completed an annuity lift-out, a transaction that provided for the purchase of an annuity contract to fund pension plan annuities of retirees from previously divested businesses, as part of a de-risking strategy. this annuity lift-out impacted 1,119 retirees and beneficiaries, as well as reduced $138 million in pension obligations and $136 million in plan assets which were transferred to an insurance company. the transfer of plan assets is considered to be a lump sum settlement payment that reduced centerpoint energy pension plan's projected benefit obligation in 2022.
as of december 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of centerpoint energy's pension plans by $341 million. changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during a year could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions at the next remeasurement.
houston electric and cerc participate in centerpoint energy's qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. pension cost by registrant were as follows:

the calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.
as of december 31, 2022, centerpoint energy's qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% rate, which is 1.50% higher than the 5.00% rate assumed as of december 31, 2021. the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. centerpoint energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.
as of december 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.15%, which is 84% higher than the 2.80% discount rate assumed as of december 31, 2021 attributed primarily to rising interest rates. the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of centerpoint energy's plans.
centerpoint energy's actuarially determined pension and other postemployment cost for 2022 and 2021 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in the majority of texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.  pension cost for 2023, including the nonqualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $54 million before applicable regulatory deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% and a discount rate of 5.15% as of december 31, 2022. if the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 6.50% to 6.00%, 2023 pension cost would increase by approximately $6 million.
as of december 31, 2022, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded nonqualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $341 million.  if the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 5.15% to 4.65%, the assumption change would increase centerpoint energy's projected benefit obligation by approximately $68 million and decrease its 2023 pension cost by approximately $2 million. the expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. in addition, the assumption change would impact centerpoint energy's consolidated balance sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31, 2022 by $59 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2022 of $7 million, net of tax of $2 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation.
future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact centerpoint energy's future pension expense and liabilities. centerpoint energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.

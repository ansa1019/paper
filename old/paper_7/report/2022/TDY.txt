item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations teledyne provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. these markets include factory automation and condition monitoring, aerospace and defense, air and water quality environmental monitoring, electronics design and development, medical imaging and pharmaceutical research, oceanographic research, and deepwater energy exploration and production. following the 2021 acquisition of flir, we further evolved into a global sensing and decision-support technology company: providing specialty sensors, cameras, instrumentation, algorithms and software across the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as unmanned systems, in the subsea, land and air domains. we differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company-sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise. we believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete.
information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" sections in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended january 2, 2022.
strategy/overview our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our four business segments: digital imaging, instrumentation, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. the markets in which we sell our enabling technologies are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. we intend to strengthen and expand our business with targeted acquisitions and through product development. we continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions and product development. we aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of our business. at teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. using complementary technology across our businesses and through targeted research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. we continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.
covid and other matters impact with regard to the covid pandemic, our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families. although the covid pandemic has impacted our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions from covid in 2022, mostly as a result of covid-related lockdowns in china and localized and temporary labor shortages due to virus exposure. however, given the continuing dynamic nature of this situation, we may not fully estimate the impacts of covid on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. contingency plans remain in place in the event of significant impacts from covid infection resurgences, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
we have experienced supply chain challenges, including increased lead times, as well as cost inflation for parts and components, logistics and labor due to availability constraints and high demand. this has delayed our ability to convert backlog to revenue and negatively impacted our profit margins. we expect inflationary and supply chain constraint trends to continue in 2023.
costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. as a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the u.s. dollar. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies adversely impacted our sales in 2022, and may continue to do so in future periods. it may also increase the price and reduce the competitiveness of some of our products sold in markets outside the united states.
we do not have any material business, operations or assets in russia, belarus or ukraine, and to date we have not been materially impacted by the actions of the russian government. our total net sales from these three countries in 2022 and 2021 constituted less than 1.0% of total net sales, respectively.
as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance, as well as to respond to the impact of the covid pandemic, beginning in 2020 we commenced actions to reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets, such as commercial aerospace. we also exited certain facilities no longer needed. in 2021, we took actions to integrate flir into our businesses resulting in higher severance and facility closure costs in the digital imaging segment. in 2021, we incurred $26.4 million of severance and facility consolidation costs, primarily related to our digital imaging segment. severance and facility consolidation costs incurred in 2022 were not material, and, at january 1, 2023, an immaterial amount remains to be paid related to these actions.
recent acquisitions consistent with our strategy, we completed two acquisitions in 2022 and one acquisition in 2021. our may 2021 acquisition of flir was our largest acquisition to date. the financial results of these acquisitions have been included since the respective date of each acquisition. all acquisitions in 2022 and 2021 were part of the digital imaging segment. see note 3 for additional information about our recent acquisitions. as discussed in note 18, we have completed one acquisition in early 2023, which is part of the digital imaging segment.
consolidated operating results our fiscal year is determined based on a 52- or 53-week convention ending on the sunday nearest to december 31. fiscal years 2022 and 2021 each contained 52 weeks. certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. in the current year, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment is presented as separate line item on the income statement.
our businesses are aligned in four segments: digital imaging, instrumentation, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. additional financial information about our business segments can be found in note 4.

* not meaningful net sales:
net sales increased across all business segments. refer to the "segments" discussion later in this section for additional discussion of changes in net sales. sales to international customers represented approximately 47% of net sales in 2022 and 47% of net sales in 2021. approximately 25% and 26% of our total net sales 2022 and 2021, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the u.s. government.
cost of sales cost of sales increased by $355.4 million in 2022, primarily driven by the impact of higher net sales. cost of sales in 2021 included $106.4 million recorded in 2021 related to acquired inventory step-up expense from the acquisition of flir. no comparable inventory step-up expense was recorded in 2022. cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2022 was 57.3%, compared with 60.1% for 2021, with the decrease in percentage from 2021 primarily related to the 2021 impact of acquired inventory step-up expense from the flir acquisition.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development expense, were higher in 2022, primarily driven by higher net sales in 2022. selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 included $102.7 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the flir acquisition. corporate expense in 2022 was $65.9 million, compared with $136.8 million in 2021. the higher 2021 amount included $77.1 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the flir acquisition. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 21.2% for 2022, compared with 23.2% for 2021. the higher percentage in 2021 primarily reflected the impact of acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the flir acquisition.
acquired intangible asset amortization acquired intangible asset amortization for 2022 was $201.7 million, compared with $149.3 million for 2021, with the increase primarily related to a full year of acquired intangible asset amortization in 2022 from the flir acquisition.
operating income operating income for 2022 was $972.0 million, compared with $624.3 million for 2021, an increase of 55.7%. the increase in operating income primarily reflected higher operating income in each segment except the engineered systems segment. corporate expense for 2022 was $65.9 million compared with $136.8 million, and the 2021 amount included $77.1 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the flir acquisition.
non-operating income and expenses interest expense, including credit facility fees and other bank charges and net of interest income, was $89.3 million in 2022, compared with $90.8 million in 2021, with the 2022 year including a full year of debt outstanding since the flir acquisition. the 2021 amount reflected interest and debt fees incurred to fund the cash portion of the flir acquisition, which included $30.6 million in bridge loan fees. in 2022, the company repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its fixed rate senior notes due august 2030 and april 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt. in 2021, the company called $493.3 million of existing fixed rate senior notes and incurred debt extinguishment expenses of $13.4 million.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate for 2022 was 13.1%, compared with 16.6% for 2021. for 2022, net discrete income tax benefits were $86.7 million, which primarily related to income tax benefits of $72.7 million for acquisition-related tax matters and $10.2 million income tax benefits related to share-based accounting. for 2021, net discrete income tax benefits were $34.7 million, which primarily related to income tax benefits of $18.2 million for acquisition-related tax matters and $13.1 million income tax benefit related to share-based accounting. excluding the net discrete income tax benefits in both years, the effective tax rates would have been 22.7% for 2022 and 23.1% for 2021.

our digital imaging segment includes high-performance sensors, cameras and systems, within the visible, infrared and x-ray spectra for use in industrial, government and medical applications, as well as mems and high-performance, high-reliability semiconductors including analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. it also includes our sponsored and centralized research laboratories which benefit government programs and commercial businesses.
2022 compared with 2021
our digital imaging segment net sales for 2022 increased 28.9%, compared with 2021. operating income for 2022 increased 59.5%, compared with 2021.
total year 2022 net sales included $593.7 million in incremental net sales from current and prior year acquisitions as well as organic sales growth from industrial and scientific sensors and cameras, x-ray products and mems, partially offset by lower sales of detectors for space imaging applications and lower sales for geospatial imaging systems. the increase in operating income in 2022 reflected the contribution from flir, and 2021 included $242.6 million of flir acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses, which consisted of $110.3 million in acquired intangible asset amortization expense, $106.4 million in inventory step-up expense and $25.9 million of integration-related costs. the increase in operating income also reflected the impact of organic sales growth.
cost of sales for 2022 increased by $283.9 million, compared with 2021, and reflected the impact of higher net sales, partially offset by the 2021 amount including $106.4 million in acquired inventory step-up expense relating to the acquisition of flir. the cost of sales percentage in 2022 decreased to 54.8% compared with 58.9% in 2021 and reflected the impact of acquired inventory step-up expense in 2021. selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 increased to $702.3 million, compared with $537.2 million in 2021 and reflected the impact of higher net sales and higher research and development expense partially offset by lower integration-related costs, as the 2021 amount included $25.9 million of integration-related costs. research and development expense increased $67.2 million in 2022, and $63.4 million of this increase related to a full year of flir in 2022. the selling, general and administrative expense percentage increased to 22.6% in 2022 from 22.3% in
2021, with the 2022 percentage including a full year of flir operating results, which carry a higher research and development expense as a percentage of sales. the increase in selling, general and administrative expense percentage was partially offset by lower flir integration-related costs in 2022 as compared to 2021.

our engineered systems segment provides innovative systems engineering and integration, advanced technology development, and manufacturing solutions for defense, space, environmental and energy applications, including the design and manufacture of electrochemical energy systems.
2022 compared with 2021
our engineered systems segment net sales for 2022 increased 1.4%, compared with 2021. operating income for 2022 decreased 19.3%, compared with 2021.
the 2022 net sales increase primarily reflected $8.2 million of higher sales for energy systems and $2.5 million of higher sales for engineered products, partially offset by lower sales of $5.2 million for turbine engines. the higher net sales for engineered products primarily reflected increased sales from marine and electronic manufacturing services programs products, partially offset by decreased sales in missile defense and space programs. teledyne exited the cruise missile turbine engine business in the first quarter of 2021. operating income in 2022 primarily reflected the impact of unfavorable product mix, primarily related to electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines.
cost of sales for 2022 increased by $13.7 million, compared with 2021, and primarily reflected the impact of higher net sales and unfavorable product mix. cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2022 increased to 84.2%, compared with 81.9% in 2021. selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development and bid and proposal expense, increased to $25.9 million in 2022, compared with $24.7 million in 2021. the selling, general and administrative expense percentage increased to 6.3% for 2022 compared to 6.1% in 2021.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources principal cash and capital requirements our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions. it is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility and the debt financing arrangements described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements. to support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents totaled $638.1 million at january 1, 2023, of which $403.2 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money-market mutual funds and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
long-term debt long-term debt, including unamortized debt issuance costs was $3,920.6 million at january 1, 2023 compared to $4,099.4 million at january 2, 2022. during 2022, the company repaid $185.0 million of debt. the company made $110.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due may 2026. the company also repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its fixed rate senior notes due august 2030 and april 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt.
at january 1, 2023, we had $38.6 million in outstanding letters of credit.
the credit agreement and term loans require the company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at january 1, 2023, the company was in compliance with these covenants and had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios. currently, we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing, if needed, is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements. available borrowing capacity under the $1.15 billion credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and $21.3 million in outstanding letters of credit, was $1,003.7 million at january 1, 2023.
see note 8 for additional information regarding our credit facility and long-term debt.

(a)    interest expense related to the credit facility, including facility fees, is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at year-end 2022 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in march 2026 when the credit facility expires.
(b)        includes imputed interest and the short-term portion of lease obligations.
(c)    purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
unrecognized tax benefits of $162.8 million and accrued interest and penalties on these tax matters of $45.6 million are not included in the table above. the remaining unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above because $32.1 million is offset by deferred tax assets, and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits.
at january 1, 2023, we were not required, and accordingly are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plans for 2023. our minimum funding requirements after 2022 as set forth by the employee retirement income security act, are dependent on several factors as discussed under "accounting for pension plans" in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation. estimates beyond 2023 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the company's pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. in addition, certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the u.s. government under certain government contracts, therefore, future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity. we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans. these plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go. see further discussion in note 10. teledyne monitors and manages its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $486.8 million and $824.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the lower cash provided by operating activities in 2022, compared with 2021 primarily resulted from a payment of $296.4 million to the swedish tax authority in the first quarter of 2022, related to a disputed pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a flir subsidiary in sweden, greater inventory purchases in 2022 as compared to 2021, to mitigate supply chain constraints and higher income tax payments of $128.8 million in 2022. these changes were partially offset by higher net income in 2022.
free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) and adjusted free cash flow (both non-gaap measures) were as follows (in millions):
free cash flow(a)                                                                              2022                    2021
cash provided by (used in) operating activities                                              $486.8                  $824.6
less: capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment                                 (92.6)                 (101.6)
free cash flow                                                                                394.2                   723.0
add back: payment for acquisition-related tax matter                                          296.4                       -
add back: flir transaction-related cash payments, net of tax                                      -                    71.6
adjusted free cash flow                                                                      $690.6                  $794.6
(a) we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities (a measure prescribed by gaap) less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of cash paid for transaction related expenses for the flir acquisition on a net of tax basis as well as the payment of a pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a flir subsidiary in sweden. we believe that this supplemental non-gaap information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company's ability to generate cash flow.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $175.4 million and $3,824.3 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. investing activities used cash for acquisitions and other investments of $99.6 million and $3,723.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively (see "recent acquisitions"). teledyne funded the acquisitions from borrowings under its credit facilities, issuance of senior notes and term loans, the issuance of teledyne common stock and cash on hand.

during 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in capital expenditures, principally to upgrade facilities and manufacturing equipment.
financing activities financing activities reflected net payments from debt of $174.8 million in 2022 and net proceeds from debt of $2,834.2 million in 2021. fiscal years 2022 and 2021 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $23.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively.
during 2022, the company repaid $185.0 million of debt. the company made $110.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due may 2026. the company also repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its fixed rate senior notes due august 2030 and april 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt.
during 2021, the company completed various financing activities as follows, with activity through the first half of 2021 primarily related to funding the cash portion of the flir acquisition:
•on january 4, 2021, the company entered into a $4.5 billion short term stand-by bridge facility to support the completion of the flir acquisition, resulting in debt expense of $17.2 million.
•on march 4, 2021, the company entered into a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (maturing may 2026) and an amended and restated credit agreement (maturing march 2026) with capacity of $1.15 billion. the terms of the $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement allow for prepayments, at the company's option, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part without premium or penalty.
•on march 17, 2021, the company called $493.3 million of existing fixed rate senior notes and incurred debt extinguishment expenses of $13.4 million, which is included in interest and debt expense, net.
•on march 22, 2021, the company completed all permanent financing for the acquisition of flir and terminated the $4.5 billion stand-by bridge facility. the permanent financing consists of $3.0 billion investment-grade bonds (the "notes"), including $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.65% notes due 2023, $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.95% notes due 2024, $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.60% notes due 2026, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% notes due 2028 and $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2031. teledyne may redeem the $450.0 million of 0.95% notes due 2024 at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, at the company's option, from and after april 1, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed.
•as part of the acquisition of flir, the company assumed and guaranteed flir's $500.0 million, 2.50% fixed rate senior notes due august 2030.
•in the second half of 2021, the company made $645.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due may 2026.
other matters pension plans teledyne has two domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. employees hired before january 1, 2004, or approximately 5% of teledyne's active employees as of january 1, 2023. as of january 1, 2004, new u.s. hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan. in 2022 and 2021, teledyne was not required, and did not make any cash contributions to the domestic pension plans. for the company's domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans, the discount rate for 2023 will increase to an average of 5.71% from 2.97% in 2022. the company also has several small non-qualified domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
the company continually evaluates its global cash needs and has historically asserted that most of its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and did not generally record deferred taxes on such amounts. during 2022, the company determined that it could no longer make the assertion foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, as cash from most foreign subsidiaries may be remitted without incurring additional u.s. federal income tax. as a result, the company changed its indefinite reinvestment assertion of unremitted earnings and certain other aspects of outside basis differences on a majority of its foreign subsidiaries.
the company continues to make an indefinite reinvestment assertion on the historic excess of the financial reporting bases over tax bases in its material foreign subsidiaries in canada. the unremitted earnings of the company's canadian foreign subsidiaries held for indefinite reinvestment are used to finance canadian operations and investments. the company estimate that future cash generation from non-canadian operations will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements. determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for unremitted canadian earnings is not practicable due to uncertainty and overall complexity of the potential calculations. the company continues to evaluate its cash needs and may update its assertion in future periods.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. in projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. based on the company's history of operating earnings, expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. the company has substantially concluded on all u.s. federal income tax matters for all years through 2011, canadian income tax matters for all years through 2012, swedish income tax matters for all years through 2016, norwegian income tax matters for all years through 2017, belgian income tax matters for all years through 2019, french income tax matters for all years through 2019 and united kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2014.
costs and pricing inflation has been rising in the markets in which we operate. current inventory costs, the increasing costs of labor, materials, equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies. the company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business.
market risk disclosures our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks. we own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable.
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through the interest rate on our borrowings under our $1.15 billion credit facility and our term loan due may 2026. as of january 1, 2023, all outstanding borrowings under our floating rate credit facility were subject to existing interest rate swap agreements, and $245.0 million outstanding under our floating rate term loan due may 2026 was exposed to interest rate risk. a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $2.5 million, assuming the $245.0 million term loan was outstanding for the full year.
foreign currency exchange rate risk teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the company to foreign currency risk. the company's primary foreign currency risk management objective is to protect the u.s. dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings, primarily achieved through the following:
•the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in canadian dollars for our canadian companies, and in british pounds for our u.k. companies. these contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.
•the company has converted u.s. dollar denominated, variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations of a european subsidiary, into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float, pay fixed cross currency swap, and a receive fixed, pay fixed cross currency swap. these cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.
•the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables.
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. refer to notes 2, 14 and 15 for further disclosures around our derivative instruments and hedging activities notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. a hypothetical 10% price change of the u.s. dollar from its value at january 1, 2023, would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy canadian dollars and to sell u.s. dollars by approximately $12.6 million. a hypothetical 10% price change in the u.s. dollar from its value at january 1, 2023 would result in a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy british pounds and to sell u.s. dollars by approximately $1.7 million. a hypothetical 10% price change in the u.s. dollar from its value at january 1, 2023 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our euro/u.s. dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately $30.8 million.
environmental we are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. these include sites at which teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and comparable state laws. we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites. reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled $5.8 million and $6.3 million as of january 1, 2023 and january 2, 2022, respectively. as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received, the company will adjust reserves to reflect new information. based on current information, we do not believe that future environmental costs, in excess of those already accrued, will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity. see also our environmental risk factor disclosure in item 1a. risk factors as well as additional discussion in notes 2 and 17.
government contracts we perform work on a number of contracts with the u.s. department of defense and other agencies and departments of the u.s. government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. sales under these contracts with the u.s. government, which included contracts with the u.s. department of defense, were approximately 25% and 26% of our total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. for a summary of sales to the u.s. government by segment, see note 4. sales to the u.s. department of defense represented approximately 20% and 19% of total net sales for 2022 and 2021, respectively.
performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations, which usually are made available on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. see also our government contracts risks factor disclosure in item 1a. risk factors.
for information on accounts receivable from the u.s. government, see note 7.
estimates and reserves our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns and replacements, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers' compensation and general liability, employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making our judgments. actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. in some cases, such differences may be material. see critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on key estimates.
some of the company's products are subject to standard warranties and the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties. we regularly assess the adequacy of our pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historical warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically one year. see further discussion in note 7.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment, complexity and uncertainty, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. we have identified the following as critical accounting policies: revenue recognition; accounting for business combinations, goodwill and acquired intangible assets; accounting for income taxes; and accounting for pension plans. for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2.
revenue recognition prior to the acquisition of flir, approximately 40% of our revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining 60% of our revenue recognized at a point in time. the majority of teledyne flir revenue is recognized at a point in time. in 2022, approximately 30% of revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining 70% recognized at a point in time.
revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design, develop and/or manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications. the transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration, including award fees, incentive fees, contract amounts not yet funded, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. we estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled, and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved. the estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. as control transfers continuously over time on these contracts, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. we generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.
for over time contracts using the cost-to-cost method, we have an estimate at completion ("eac") process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. this eac process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue, determining reasonably dependable cost estimates, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catch-up basis. this method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters. additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident. contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly.
we do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2022 and 2021 was material to the consolidated statement of income for such annual periods.
revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products, with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title. see note 5 for additional revenue recognition disclosures.
business combinations, goodwill and acquired intangible assets the results for all acquisitions are included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. we determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. we review goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. the company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. we test goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors.
we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. we perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years.
for goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values over a multi-year period. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated, and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
when using a quantitative approach, changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the company's reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the company will apply a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compare those values to the reporting unit carrying values. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into the company.
as of january 1, 2023, the company had ten reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. in the fourth quarter of 2022, a qualitative test was performed for each reporting unit excluding the flir reporting unit, and the carrying value of goodwill included in these nine reporting units subject to the current year qualitative test ranged from $20.4 million to $889.7 million. the company's qualitative analysis in 2022 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. for the flir reporting unit, the company bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative test in the fourth quarter of 2022. at the assessment date, the flir reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included $5,748.0 million of goodwill, by approximately 14%. although no impairment exists for the flir reporting unit, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, changes to customer spending priorities, or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future net sales.
income taxes for a description of the company's tax accounting policies, refer to note 2 and note 9. we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. in addition, uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns which may impact income tax expense. on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate which is dependent on the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. although we believe our income tax expense is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions. to the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. an increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023, of $9.1 million.
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards. significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across domestic and foreign jurisdictions. we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. we follow a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. judgment is exercised in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information. the technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. in measuring the tax position, we consider the amount and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained, we record a liability for the anticipated tax and interest due upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, increased in 2021 due to the acquisition of flir. during the first quarter of 2022, we paid approximately $296.4 million related to an acquired uncertain tax position; refer to note 3 for additional detail. to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations.
pension plans the company's accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. in consultation with our actuaries, we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits. net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10% of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations. gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization. for our plan which covers mostly inactive participants, gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average participants future life expectancy which is approximately 17 years. this plan represents the majority of the pension obligations. for our other plan, gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average employee future service period which is approximately nine years. significant assumptions used in determining our pension income or expense are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover, as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations.
differences in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2022 pension expense (in millions):
0.25 percentage               0.25 percentage point increase                 point decrease increase (decrease) to pension expense resulting from:
change in discount rate                                        $(0.1)                           $0.1
change in long-term rate of return on plan assets              $(2.1)                           $2.1
see note 10 for additional pension disclosures.

safe harbor cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, directly and indirectly relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation costs, statements and goals relating to greenhouse gas emission reductions, environmental remediation cost, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans. forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are based on the current expectations of the management of teledyne and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. all statements made in this annual report on form 10-k that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
many factors could change the anticipated results, including: ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the covid pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, including production, supply, contractual and other disruptions, such as covid-related lockdowns, facility closures, furloughs and travel restrictions; changes in relevant tax and other laws; foreign currency exchange risks; rising interest rates; risks associated with indebtedness, as well as our ability to reduce indebtedness and the timing thereof; the impact of semiconductor and other supply chain shortages, higher inflation, including wage competition and higher shipping costs; labor shortages and competition for skilled personnel; the inability to develop and market new competitive products; inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures, in accordance with u.s. gaap and related standards;
disruptions in the global economy; the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, including the impact to energy prices and availability, especially in europe; customer and supplier bankruptcies; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to u.s. and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by the covid pandemic; impacts from the united kingdom's exit from the european union; uncertainties related to the policies of the u.s. presidential administration; the imposition and expansion of, and responses to, trade sanctions and tariffs; the continuing review and resolution of flir's export and tax matters; escalating economic and diplomatic tension between china and the united states; threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cybersecurity threats; natural and man-made disasters, including those related to or intensified by climate change; and our ability to achieve emission reduction targets and decrease our carbon footprint. lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the middle east or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including those implemented in response to climate change, could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. weakness in the commercial aerospace industry negatively affects the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. in addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of the company's pension assets. changes in the policies of u.s. and foreign governments, including economic sanctions, could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates.
while teledyne's growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of chartworld, involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain key management and customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. there are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from u.s. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations.
we continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. while we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained beginning on page 6 of this form 10-k under the caption "risk factors; cautionary statement as to forward-looking statements." forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate", "project", "predict", "believes" or "expect", that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise.

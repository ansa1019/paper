covid-19
we believe the extent of covid-19's impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and could continue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. because of these uncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or to what extent covid-19 will impact our operations.
2022 operations summary net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc. totaled $5.643 billion, or $19.15 per diluted share, for 2022, compared to $6.956 billion, or $21.16 per diluted share, for 2021. the 2022 results include gains on sales of facilities of $1.301 billion, or $2.46 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $78 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. the 2021 results include gains on sales of facilities of $1.620 billion, or $3.69 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $12 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. our provisions for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 include tax benefits of $77 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, and $119 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. all "per diluted share" disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 294.666 million shares and 328.752 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. during 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 30.747 million and 37.812 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021. revenues increased 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2022, compared to 2021. the consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined impact of a 0.4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted from the net impact of a 3.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 0.1% decline in revenue per equivalent admission.
during 2022, consolidated admissions declined 0.7% and same facility admissions increased 0.5%, compared to 2021. inpatient surgical volumes were flat on a consolidated basis and increased 0.9% on a same facility basis during 2022, compared to 2021. outpatient surgical volumes increased 1.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.8% on a same facility basis during 2022, compared to 2021. emergency room visits increased 5.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 7.6% on a same facility basis during 2022, compared to 2021.
the estimated cost of total uncompensated care increased $141 million for 2022, compared to 2021. consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions declined 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively, and consolidated and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.4% and 6.6%, respectively, for 2022, compared to 2021.
interest expense totaled $1.741 billion for 2022, compared to $1.566 billion for 2021. the $175 million increase in interest expense for 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance, which was partially offset by a decline in the average effective interest rate.
cash flows from operating activities declined $437 million, from $8.959 billion for 2021 to $8.522 billion for 2022. the decline in cash flows from operating activities was related primarily to a negative change in working capital items of $649 million, mainly from a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decline in net income of $687 million, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, offset by a decline in cash payments for interest and income taxes of $847 million for 2022 compared to 2021.

business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, convenient and cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. we strive to be the health care system of choice in the communities we serve by developing comprehensive networks locally and supporting these networks with enterprise expertise and economies of scale. our strategy is organized around a framework that seeks to drive sustained growth by delivering operational excellence, attracting exceptional physicians and other health care professionals, developing comprehensive services, creating greater access, and coordinating higher quality care for patients. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women's services. additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities, imaging centers and home health and hospice services, as well as seeking to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical, operational and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and retain physicians and other health care professionals to meet the need for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other health care professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians and other health care professionals by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians and other health care professionals will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
continue to utilize economies of scale to grow the company. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully utilizing the scale and scope of our organization. we continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to deploy key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda and achieve cost savings and other benefits for the patients and communities we serve, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers.
our strategy also emphasizes investments that advance our clinical systems and digital capabilities, transform care models with innovative care solutions, expand our workforce development programs and enhance our health care networks and partnerships.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management's interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income above 400% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. we apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain emergency services. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. we may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. the estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management's assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the "hindsight analysis") as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our revenues.

to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. a summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
2022                2021                2020
patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating         $51,180             $49,074             $44,271
expenses and depreciation and amortization)
cost-to-charges ratio (patient care costs as percentage of gross                11.0   %            11.3   %            12.0   %
patient charges)
total uncompensated care                                                     $31,734             $29,642             $29,029
multiply by the cost-to-charges ratio                                           11.0   %            11.3   %            12.0   %
estimated cost of total uncompensated care                                    $3,491              $3,350              $3,483
management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $75 million per occurrence, subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. we purchase excess insurance on an occurrence reported basis for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $517 million, $453 million and $435 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. during 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $55 million, $87 million and $112 million, respectively, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.

professional liability claims (continued)
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.802 billion to $2.159 billion at december 31, 2022 and $1.752 billion to $2.098 billion at december 31, 2021. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $29 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $28 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $135 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $123 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,000 and 2,100 individual claims at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $2.043 billion and $2.022 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $515 million and $508 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is included in "other accrued expenses." obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $60 million and $55 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively) were $1.983 billion and $1.967 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2022 and 2021 are comprised of $793 million and $874 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $1.190 billion and $1.093 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.
changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. we have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. patient volumes and the related revenues were negatively impacted by covid-19 beginning in the first half of 2020, and subsequent periods through the first half of 2022 have experienced fluctuations in covid-19 volumes and revenues through the various surges, impacting comparisons for most of our patient volume and revenues operating statistics. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.
revenues increased 2.5% to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021 and increased 14.0% for 2021 from $51.533 billion for 2020. the increase in revenues in 2022 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 0.4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. the increase in revenues in 2021 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 6.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 6.8% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.
same facility revenues increased 3.2% for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 and increased 14.4% for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the 3.2% increase for 2022 can be attributed to the net impact of a 3.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 0.1% decline in revenue per equivalent admission. the 14.4% increase for 2021 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 6.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 7.6% increase in equivalent admissions.

at december 31, 2022, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 30 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities' revenues totaled $13.812 billion, $13.670 billion and $11.442 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. at december 31, 2022, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 37 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities' revenues totaled $16.450 billion, $15.344 billion and $13.528 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. during 2022, 2021 and 2020, 58%, 56% and 56%, respectively, of our admissions and 50%, 49% and 49%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 74%, 72% and 72%, respectively, of our uninsured admissions each year during 2022, 2021 and 2020.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. some state medicaid programs use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by cms to implement medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. we receive supplemental payments in several states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

revenues increased 2.5% to $60.233 billion for 2022 from $58.752 billion for 2021. the increase in revenues was due to the combined impact of a 0.4% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.1% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2021. same facility revenues increased 3.2% due primarily to the net impact of a 3.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 0.1% decline in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2021.
salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.0% in 2022 and 45.6% in 2021. salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 1.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 3.3% for 2022 compared to 2021 as inflation has impacted our labor costs and as we continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. we expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact our labor costs in the future. we intend to continue reducing our utilization of and rates paid for premium rate labor, but our ability to mitigate labor cost challenges may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. share-based compensation expense was $341 million in 2022 and $440 million in 2021.
supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.6% in 2022 and 16.1% in 2021. supply costs per equivalent admission declined 3.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for medical devices, but declined 18.8% for pharmacy supplies and 1.6% for general medical and surgical items in 2022 compared to 2021. the decline in pharmacy supplies is primarily related to higher utilization of certain covid-19 therapies during 2021.

equity in earnings of affiliates was $45 million for 2022 and $113 million for 2021. the decline of $68 million is primarily related to the sale of an equity investment during 2021.

interest expense increased to $1.741 billion for 2022 from $1.566 billion for 2021. the $175 million increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average debt balance, which was partially offset by a decline in the average effective interest rate. our average debt balance was $37.363 billion for 2022 compared to $32.109 billion for 2021. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.7% for 2022 and 4.9% for 2021.
gains on sales of facilities were $1.301 billion and $1.620 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the gains on sales of facilities for 2022 are primarily related to the sales of controlling interests in a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization and subsidiaries of our research entities. the gains on sales of facilities for 2021 are primarily related to the sales of five hospitals in georgia and other health care entity investments.
during 2022, we issued $6.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. we used a portion of the net proceeds to pay down our revolving credit facilities, and we redeemed all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due 2023 and all $1.250 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes due 2023. the pretax loss on retirement of debt for these two redemptions was $78 million. during 2021, we issued $2.350 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. we also amended and restated our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, including increasing availability under the asset-based revolving credit facility to $4.500 billion, extending the maturity date on both facilities to june 30, 2026 and entering into a new $1.500 billion term loan a facility and a new $500 million term loan b facility (the "credit agreement transactions"). we used the net proceeds from the senior notes issuance and the credit agreement transactions to retire $3.657 billion of term loan facilities. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $12 million.

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $765 million for 2021 to $1.191 billion for 2022. the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the gain on the sale of a controlling interest in a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization and the partnership operations of two of our texas markets.
for results of operations comparisons relating to years ending december 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to our annual report on form 10-k, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") on february 18, 2022.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $8.522 billion in 2022 compared to $8.959 billion in 2021 and $9.232 billion in 2020. the $437 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2022, compared to 2021, was related primarily to a negative change in working capital items of $649 million, mainly from a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decline in net income of $687 million, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, offset by a decline in cash payments for interest and income taxes of $847 million for 2022 compared to 2021. the $273 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2021, compared to 2020, was related to a negative change in working capital items of $1.781 billion, primarily from an increase in accounts receivable, offset by the increase in net income, excluding the non-cash impact of losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and depreciation and amortization. cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $1.075 billion for 2021 compared to 2020. during 2020, we deferred $688 million of social security taxes as allowed for under the cares act. half of these taxes were paid in january 2022 and the remainder was paid in january 2023. working capital totaled $3.741 billion at december 31, 2022 and $3.960 billion at december 31, 2021.

we, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws.
during february 2021, january 2022 and january 2023, our board of directors authorized $6 billion, $8 billion and $3 billion, respectively, for share repurchases of the company's outstanding common stock. the february 2021 authorization was completed during 2022, and at december 31, 2022, there was $1.586 billion of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the january 2022 authorization. funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.
during 2022, our board of directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. on january 26, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share on our common stock payable on march 31, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 17, 2023. the timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the company.
in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($3.535 billion as of december 31, 2022 and $4.445 billion as of january 31, 2023) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets. effective in january 2023, availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility was increased by $1.500 billion to total $3.500 billion.

management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
hca inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of hca healthcare, inc., is the primary obligor under a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes. the senior secured credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are "unrestricted subsidiaries" under our indenture dated december 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). on may 25, 2022, standard & poor's rating services ("s&p") announced it had issued an investment grade rating with respect to the issuer credit rating of hca healthcare, inc. and its subsidiaries. s&p's announcement, in conjunction with previously disclosed events, constituted an "investment grade rating event" or a "ratings event," as applicable, under the terms of the indentures governing hca inc.'s outstanding senior secured notes and, as a result, the conditions in the senior secured indentures to permit the permanent release of the subsidiary guarantees and all collateral securing the senior secured notes were met. the subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing our senior secured credit facilities are not affected. following this release of the subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing the senior secured notes, the subsidiary guarantors deregistered with the sec. as a result, summarized financial information for hca healthcare, inc., hca inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, and information about the subsidiary guarantees and affiliates whose securities were pledged as collateral will no longer be presented.
all of the senior notes issued by hca inc. in 2014 or later continue to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by hca healthcare, inc. the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of hca healthcare, inc. and hca inc. are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of hca healthcare, inc. as a result, summarized financial information of hca healthcare, inc. and hca inc. is not required to be presented under rule 13-01 of regulation s-x.
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. our insurance subsidiaries held $473 million of investment securities at december 31, 2022. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2022, we had unrealized losses of $38 million on the insurance subsidiaries' investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

market risk (continued)
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $4.780 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2022 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $33.304 billion at december 31, 2022 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 4.7% for 2022 and 4.9% for 2021.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $35.555 billion at december 31, 2022. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $48 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
we are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. we currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.
tax examinations the internal revenue service ("irs") was conducting an examination of the company's 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and the 2019 return for one affiliated partnership at december 31, 2022. we are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

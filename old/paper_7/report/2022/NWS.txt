consumers overwhelmingly turn to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. the digital real estate services segment's success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals, homebuilders and landlords and attractive to its advertisers. the digital real estate services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other operators of real estate and property websites and mobile apps.

the foxtel group competes for audiences primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional free-to-air ("fta") tv operators in australia, including the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters, and content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. these providers include, internet protocol television, or iptv, subscription video-on-demand and broadcast video-on-demand providers; streaming services offered through digital media providers; as well as programmers and distributors that provide content directly to consumers over the internet.
anc operates the sky news network, australia's 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service, and also owns and operates the australia channel iptv service for international markets. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers and advertising.
the most significant operating expenses of the subscription video services segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations, expenses related to cable, satellite and data-related transmission costs and studio and engineering expense. the expenses associated with licensing certain sports programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the subscription video services segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the foxtel group's local and international sports programming. sports programming rights costs associated with a dedicated channel are amortized over 12 months. other expenses include subscriber acquisition costs such as sales costs and marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, technology, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
dow jones the dow jones segment's products target individual consumers and enterprise customers. revenue from the dow jones segment's consumer business is derived primarily from circulation, which includes subscription and single-copy sales of its digital and print consumer products, the sale of digital and print advertising, licensing fees for its print and digital consumer content and participation fees for its live journalism events. circulation revenues are dependent on the content of the dow jones segment's consumer products, prices of its and/or competitors' products, as well as promotional activities and news cycles. advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including demand for the dow jones segment's consumer products, general economic and business conditions, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. advertising revenues are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the company's second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season. in addition, the traditional consumer print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences, which have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, both print circulation and advertising revenues. advertising, in particular, has been impacted by long-term structural movements in advertising spending from print to digital. the increasing range of advertising choices and formats has resulted in audience fragmentation and increased competition. technologies and policies have also been and will continue to be developed and implemented that may make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising or allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues. as a multi-platform news provider, the dow jones segment recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital and other products, which represent an increasingly larger share of revenues at its consumer business. mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the dow jones segment to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. the dow jones segment continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms, including leveraging its content through licensing arrangements with third-party distribution platforms and growing its live journalism events business.
operating expenses for the consumer business include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial and commissions. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overheads. the costs associated with printing and distributing newspapers, including paper prices and delivery costs, are key operating expenses whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the dow jones segment's consumer business. the consumer business is affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions and tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. paper suppliers. in addition, the dow jones segment relies on third parties for much of the printing and distribution of its print products. long-term structural movements from print to digital and changing labor markets present challenges to the financial and operational stability of these third parties which could, in turn, impact the availability, or increase the cost, of third-party printing and distribution services for the company's newspapers.
the dow jones segment's consumer products compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. as a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer business continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, as well as programmatic advertising buying channels and off-platform distribution of its products.
the dow jones segment's professional information business, which targets enterprise customers, derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to its professional information products. the professional information business serves enterprise customers with products that combine news and information with technology and tools that inform decisions and aid awareness, research and understanding. the success of the professional information business depends on its ability to provide products, services, applications and functionalities that meet the needs of its enterprise customers, who operate in information-intensive and oftentimes highly regulated industries such as finance and insurance. the professional information business must also anticipate and respond to industry trends and regulatory and technological changes.
significant expenses for the professional information business include development costs, sales and marketing expenses, hosting and support services, royalties, salaries, consulting and professional fees, sales commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.
the dow jones segment's professional information products compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including reuters news, relx (including lexisnexis and icis), refinitiv, s&p global, dtn and argus media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.
book publishing the book publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, children's and religious books in the u.s. and internationally. the revenues and operating results of the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. the book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. this marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms, such as e-books and downloadable audiobooks, and distribution channels and other factors. each book is a separate and distinct product and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.
major new title releases represent a significant portion of the book publishing segment's sales throughout the fiscal year. print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. in the domestic and international markets, the book publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions, including recent increases in inflation and supply chain disruptions, which are expected to continue to adversely affect costs in the near term. operating expenses for the book publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, freight, authors' royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead costs.
news media revenue at the news media segment is derived primarily from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising have affected, and may continue to affect, revenues. advertising revenues at the news media segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the company's second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the company's and/or competitors' products, as well as by promotional activities and news cycles.
operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions, technology and radio sports rights. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. the cost of paper is a key operating expense whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the segment. the news media segment continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. the news media segment's expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions and tariffs.
the news media segment's products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. the success of these products also depends upon advertisers' judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics.
the news media segment's traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. the news media segment is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move from print to digital. these alternative media formats could impact the segment's overall performance, positively or negatively. in addition, technologies and policies have been and will continue to be developed and implemented that may make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising or allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues.
as multi-platform news providers, the businesses within the news media segment recognize the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid content and in new advertising models, and continue to invest in their digital products. mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the businesses within the news media segment to make their content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop their products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. the businesses within the news media segment continue to develop and implement strategies to exploit their content across a variety of media channels and platforms, including leveraging their content through licensing arrangements with third-party distribution platforms.
other the other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters and expenses associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives.

**    not meaningful revenues-revenues increased $1,027 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the increase at the digital real estate services segment primarily due to higher real estate revenues and the acquisition of mortgage choice, at the dow jones segment primarily due to the increase in circulation and subscription revenues, which includes the impacts from the acquisitions of ibd and opis, and higher advertising revenues, at the news media segment primarily due to higher advertising and circulation and subscription revenues and at the book publishing segment primarily due to the acquisition of hmh books and media. the increases were partially offset by the decrease at the subscription video services segment due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as higher streaming and advertising revenues more than offset lower residential subscription revenues. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2022 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $110 million.
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $161 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. the company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.
operating expenses-operating expenses increased $293 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. the increase was primarily driven by higher expenses at the book publishing segment due to the acquisition of hmh books and media and higher manufacturing and freight costs related to increased sales volumes, the mix of titles and the impact of ongoing supply chain and inflationary pressures. the increase was also driven by the dow jones segment due to higher employee costs and the impact from recent acquisitions, higher costs at the news media segment primarily due to higher costs associated with talktv and higher print production costs in the u.k., as well as at the digital real estate services segment due to higher employee costs. the company has generally observed a very competitive labor market which has led to higher compensation and hiring costs for attracting and retaining highly qualified employees at some of its businesses and is expected to continue to impact the company's cost base in the near term. the increases were partially offset by lower expenses at the subscription video services segment, primarily due to the absence of $57 million of additional sports programming rights and production costs recognized in the prior year that were deferred from fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic ("covid-19")
and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming rights costs due to increased content availability. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $76 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.
selling, general and administrative-selling, general and administrative increased $338 million, or 10%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in selling, general and administrative for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 was primarily due to increased expenses at the digital real estate services segment driven by the acquisitions of mortgage choice and rea india, higher employee costs at both move and rea group and increased marketing expenses at move. the increase was also driven by higher costs at the dow jones segment due to the impact of recent acquisitions, including a $25 million impact from opis and cma-related transaction costs, increased employee costs and increased sales and marketing costs. the increase was partially offset by lower costs of $67 million in the other segment, primarily driven by lower equity-based compensation costs largely related to stock price performance and lower one-time legal settlement costs. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative decrease of $61 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased $8 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, $28 million of higher amortization expense from intangible assets driven by the company's recent acquisitions was partially offset by $20 million of lower depreciation expense driven by the transition to digital and optimization of the company's printing operations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $13 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.
impairment and restructuring charges-during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2022 and 2021, the company recorded restructuring charges of $94 million and $168 million, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $15 million related to the write-down of fixed assets associated with the shutdown and anticipated sale of certain u.s. printing facilities at the dow jones segment.
see note 5-restructuring programs and note 7-property, plant and equipment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
equity losses of affiliates-equity losses of affiliates decreased by $52 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the absence of the $54 million non-cash write-down of the foxtel group's investment in the nickelodeon australia joint venture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. see note 6-investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
interest expense, net-interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 increased $46 million as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the issuance of the 2021 and 2022 senior notes in april 2021 and february 2022, respectively, and the incurrence of the term a loans in march 2022. see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
other, net-other, net decreased $91 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. see note 21-additional financial information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
income tax expense-the company's income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 were $52 million and 6%, respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $61 million and 14%, respectively, for fiscal 2021.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company recorded income tax expense of $52 million on pre-tax income of $812 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances, including $149 million related to certain foreign deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, the lower tax impact related to the sale of rea group's malaysia and thailand businesses and the remeasurement of deferred taxes in the u.k.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021, the company recorded income tax expense of $61 million on pre-tax income of $450 million, resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the tax rate was impacted by valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and by the impact of foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, offset by a release of valuation allowances of $64 million related to certain u.s. deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized and the remeasurement of deferred taxes in the u.k.
management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. based on management's assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets.
net income-net income was $760 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, as compared to $389 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021, an improvement of $371 million, or 95%, primarily driven by higher total segment ebitda, lower impairment and restructuring charges and lower losses from equity affiliates, partially offset by lower other, net and higher interest expense.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests-net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $137 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, as compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $59 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021, primarily driven by increased earnings at rea group, which included the $107 million gain from the disposition of its entities in malaysia and thailand.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the company's businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the company's business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the company's operations and other factors that affect the company's reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the company's consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, revenues at the subscription video services segment decreased $46 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal 2021, due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as the $114 million increase in streaming revenues, primarily from binge and kayo, and higher advertising revenues more than offset lower residential subscription revenues resulting from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. foxtel group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 20% of total circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, as compared to 14% in fiscal 2021. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $61 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, segment ebitda increased $1 million as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the absence of $57 million of additional sports programming rights and production costs recognized in the prior year that were deferred from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to covid-19 and lower employee costs due to reduced headcount, largely offset by higher sports and entertainment programming rights costs due to increased content availability, higher technology costs, higher investment spending on streaming products, mainly in marketing, and the negative $8 million impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, revenues at the book publishing segment increased $206 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the $149 million contribution from the acquisition of hmh books and media in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, increased book sales in the u.k. and higher revenues in the general books category, which benefited from the releases of twelve and a half by gary vaynerchuk, the storyteller by dave grohl and the pioneer woman cooks: super easy! by ree drummond. christian publishing sales also improved, driven by the ongoing recovery of certain distribution channels from covid-19. the increases were partially offset by a $16 million impact from lower sales of the bridgerton series and lower sales in the foreign language and children's publishing categories. digital sales increased by 4% as compared to fiscal 2021 due to growth in downloadable audiobooks, partially offset by lower sales of e-books. digital sales represented approximately 21% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $14 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2022 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $20 million.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment increased $3 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2021, including a $22 million positive impact from the acquisition of hmh books and media, as the higher revenues discussed above were largely offset by higher manufacturing and freight costs related to increased sales volumes, the mix of titles and the impact from ongoing supply chain and inflationary pressures. these supply chain and inflationary pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term.

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of june 30, 2022, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $1.82 billion. the company also has available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. the company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, including repayment of indebtedness. although the company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next 12 months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (ii) the company's credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents; (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (v) the state of the economy. there can be no assurances that the company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.
as of june 30, 2022, the company's consolidated assets included $853 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. of this amount, $169 million is cash not readily accessible by the company as it is held by rea group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. rea group must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group's cash balance. prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"), the company's undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and as such, united states federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. as a result of the tax act, substantially all of the company's earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the tax act were deemed to have been repatriated and taxed accordingly. as of june 30, 2022, the company has approximately $900 million of undistributed foreign earnings that it intends to reinvest permanently. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated. the company may repatriate future earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in which case the company may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding taxes and income taxes.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and programming costs; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; the repurchase of shares; dividends; and the repayment of debt and related interest. in addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the company's securities or the assumption of indebtedness.
issuer purchases of equity securities on september 22, 2021, the company announced a new repurchase program authorizing the company to purchase up to $1 billion in the aggregate of its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. the repurchase program replaces the company's $500 million class a common stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may 2013. the manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases will be determined by the company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. the repurchase program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. as of june 30, 2022, the remaining authorized amount under the repurchase program was approximately $817 million.
stock repurchases commenced on november 9, 2021. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022, the company repurchased and subsequently retired 5.8 million shares of class a common stock for approximately $122 million and 2.9 million shares of class b common stock for approximately $61 million. the company did not purchase any of its class a common stock or class b common stock during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021.

the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the board of directors. the board of directors' decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the company's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.

for the fiscal years ended june 30,             2022                  2021

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation free cash flow available to news corporation is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures ("free cash flow"), less rea group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from rea group. free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.
the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company's balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the company's business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. the company believes excluding rea group's free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company, as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group's cash balance. the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company's free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group, which has generally been lower than the company's unadjusted free cash flow.
a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period.

________________________
(a)the company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.
(b)the company has sports programming rights commitments with the national rugby league, australian football league and cricket australia, as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2028.
(c)the company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.
(d)the company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite services and equipment. these leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048. amounts reflected represent only the company's lease obligations for which it has firm commitments.
(e)the company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. the company's satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases, based on the underlying terms of those arrangements.
(f)see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(g)reflects the company's expected future interest payments based on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at june 30, 2022. such rates are subject to change in future periods. see note 9-borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company's total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.
the table also excludes the company's pension obligations, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. the company made contributions of $29 million and $35 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2023, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's returns in fiscal 2022 and those expected beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's opeb plans. the company expects its opeb payments to approximate $8 million in fiscal 2023. see note 17-retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
other significant ongoing expenses or cash requirements for each of the company's segments are discussed above in "overview of the company's businesses." the company generally expects to fund these short and long-term cash requirements with internally-generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
contingencies the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in note 16-commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. see note 16-commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company's tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company's tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company. see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
long-lived assets the company's long-lived assets include goodwill, finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring a business and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
under asc 350, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as part of the company's long-range planning process, the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.
the performance of the company's annual impairment analysis resulted in no impairments to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 8.0% to 19.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.25% to 7.0%). significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 5.0% to 10.0%). significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. see note 8-goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding changes in these inputs and assumptions compared to prior fiscal years.
as of june 30, 2022, there were no reporting units with goodwill at-risk for future impairment. the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.
programming costs costs incurred in acquiring programming rights are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, "entertainment-broadcasters." programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program, which requires significant judgment. the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership, an accelerated method of amortization is used. the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively. the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value. changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events. the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired. for sports contracts with dedicated channels, the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740, "income taxes."
the company's annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant management judgment is required in determining the company's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company's net deferred tax assets, if any. in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. the company's actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the company's forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. although the company believes its current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. the company's policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax (expense) benefit.
see note 19-income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these estimates and assumptions and changes compared to prior fiscal years.
retirement benefit obligations the company's employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries. see note 17-retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap. the measurement and recognition of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. net periodic benefit costs (income) are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates. current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolio's past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 4.3% for fiscal 2023 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 17% equities, 76% fixed-income securities and 7% cash and other investments.
the company recorded nil and $(1) million in net periodic benefit (income) costs in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 4.1% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs (income). the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2022 and 2021 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:
2022                                                                                                                            2021

one year actual return                                                                         (15.6)%                          3.7%
five year actual return                                                                           0.8%                          5.9%
the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 4.3% for fiscal 2023 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2022 were approximately $459 million which decreased from approximately $542 million for the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2021. this net decrease of $83 million was primarily due to currency movements and unrecognized losses amortized during fiscal 2022. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company's accumulated net loss and decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.
the company made contributions of $29 million and $35 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected returns in fiscal 2022 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2023. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. see note 18-other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
changes in assumption   impact on annual           impact on projected pension expense            benefit obligation
0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   increase $1 million        increase $35 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   decrease $1 million        decrease $32 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $3 million        -

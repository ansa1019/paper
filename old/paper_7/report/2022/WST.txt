item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion is intended to further the reader's understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company. it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than usd at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. we may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. the unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. the re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable u.s. gaap financial measures. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.

through the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, the war between russia and ukraine has not had a material impact on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations as we do not have manufacturing operations or significant commercial relationships in either country. however, the continuation of the russia-ukraine military conflict and/or an escalation of the conflict beyond its current scope may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy.
during 2022, we experienced higher costs for raw materials and supply chain challenges related to manufacturing equipment. due to the uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. the impacts of macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in item 1a. risk factors.
components of and key factors influencing our results of operations in assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. we believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.
net sales our net sales results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the net consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
several factors affect our reported net sales in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions, competition, and business acquisitions that involve our customers or competitors.
cost of goods and services sold and gross profit cost of goods and services sold includes personnel costs, manufacturing costs, raw materials and product costs, freight costs, depreciation, and facility costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. fluctuations in our cost of goods sold correspond with the fluctuations in sales units as well as inflationary and other market factors that influence our cost base.
gross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of goods and services sold. our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used to make our products.
research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to our investments in improvements to our manufacturing processes, product enhancements, and additional investments in our elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumables.
we expense research and development costs as incurred. our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period primarily based on the ongoing improvements to our manufacturing processes and product enhancements.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, and depreciation.

$142.2 million, $35.5 million and $49.7 million, respectively, while total current liabilities decreased by $60.8 million. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to cash collections from operations, offset by share repurchases, debt repayments and payment of annual incentive compensation during 2022. the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity. the increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers. the decrease in total current liabilities was caused by the decline in accrued salaries, wages and benefits and accounts payable.
debt and credit facilities - the $44.1 million decrease in total debt at december 31, 2022, as compared to december 31, 2021, resulted from our $42.0 million principal repayment of the series a notes on july 5, 2022 and quarterly repayments of principal under our term loan.
our sources of liquidity include our credit facility. at december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. at december 31, 2022, the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit of $2.4 million, was $497.6 million. we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. please refer to note 10, debt, for further discussion of our credit facility.
pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. in addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. at december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2023.
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations to continue to meet customer demand.

critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:
impairment of long-lived assets: long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances, such as a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions or a change in company strategy, increased competition, declining product demand, plans to dispose of an asset or asset group, or recent financial or legal factors that could impact the expected cash flows, indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, selection of appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. the company uses estimates that are consistent with its business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated. once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other expense (income) for the difference between the asset's carrying value and its fair value. for assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. for assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. a goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. we elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test. if, based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount, then it would not be necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
valuing identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. for example, for recent identifiable customer relationship intangible asset acquisitions, we applied an excess earnings model, which is a form of the income approach. this approach includes projecting revenues and expenses attributable to the existing customers over the remaining economic life of the customer relationships and then subtracting the required return on net tangible assets and any intangible assets used in the business to estimate any residual excess earnings attributable to the customer relationships. the after-tax excess earnings are then discounted to present value using the respective discount rates. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: 1) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; 2) significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business; 3) significant negative industry or economic trends; and 4) recognition of goodwill impairment charges. if we determine that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an un-discounted basis, to be generated from such assets. if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure an impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair values of the assets.
employee benefits: we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the u.s. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. in addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of january 1, 2017. the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our u.s. and foreign plans. the assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover, and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. for our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. one of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate. under u.s. gaap, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. we estimate that every 25-basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.1 million, and every 25-basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by $0.0 million. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. our net pension underfunded balance at december 31, 2022 was $26.1 million, compared to $20.6 million at december 31, 2021. our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $3.9 million at december 31, 2022, compared to $5.6 million at december 31, 2021.
income taxes: we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. in addition, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities. the enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference. valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

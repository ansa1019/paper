item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
for the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, refer to "part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 filed with the sec on february 16, 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference.
covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry beginning in 2020. since the beginning of the pandemic, the pervasiveness and severity of travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives have varied by country and state; however, as of december 31, 2022, most of the countries we operate in had eased or completely lifted such restrictions. while the pandemic negatively affected certain of our results for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we have experienced strong signs of recovery since early 2021, with comparable system-wide revpar in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 exceeding levels achieved in the same periods in 2019. although all periods included in our consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10-k were impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, none of these periods are considered comparable, and no periods affected by the pandemic are expected to be comparable to future periods.
overview our business hilton is one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with 7,165 properties comprising 1,127,430 rooms in 123 countries and territories as of december 31, 2022. our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury hotel brands, waldorf astoria hotels & resorts, lxr hotels & resorts and conrad hotels & resorts; our lifestyle hotel brands, canopy by hilton, curio collection by hilton, tapestry collection by hilton, tempo by hilton and motto by hilton; our full service hotel brands, signia by hilton, hilton hotels & resorts and doubletree by hilton; our focused service hotel brands, hilton garden inn, hampton by hilton and tru by hilton; our all-suites hotel brands, embassy suites by hilton, homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton; our new premium economy brand, spark by hilton, launched in january 2023; and our timeshare brand, hilton grand vacations. as of december 31, 2022, we had 152 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, hilton honors, a 19 percent increase from december 31, 2021.
segments and regions we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products and services: (i) management and franchise; and (ii) ownership. the management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our ip. revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv for the right to use our ip; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. as a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees. as a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservation system, marketing and information technology services, while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels. the ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
geographically, we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions: (i) the americas; (ii) emea; and (iii) asia pacific. the americas region includes north america, south america and central america, including all caribbean nations. although the u.s., which represented 69 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of december 31, 2022, is included in the americas region, it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas region and, as such, it is presented separately within the analysis herein. the emea region includes europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east, and the middle east and africa ("mea"), which represents the middle east region and all african nations, including the indian ocean island nations. europe and mea are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within the analysis herein. the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia, as well as india, australia, new zealand and the pacific island nations.
system growth and development pipeline our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, as well as of our fee-based business. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with limited or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our ip. prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, over time we expect to increase revenues, overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs. see further discussion on our cash management policy, as detailed in "-liquidity and capital resources." while these objectives have not changed as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the current economic environment has posed certain challenges to the execution of our growth strategy, which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development.
in addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. the following table summarizes our development activity:

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations revenues principal components we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources:
•franchise and licensing fees. represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands, as well as fees from licensing agreements to use our ip. under our long-term franchise contracts with hotel owners, franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include: (i) monthly royalty fees, generally based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross room revenue, and, in some cases, may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable; and (ii) application, initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system, when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees. our non-hotel licensing agreements, for which we receive licensing fees, are predominantly with strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv.
•base and incentive management fees. represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels. terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross revenue and, when applicable, an incentive fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits, normally over a one-calendar year period, and, in some cases, may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner. outside of the u.s., our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures, either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive fee, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees.
•owned and leased hotels. represents revenues derived from the operations of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including hotel room sales, accommodations sold in conjunction with other services, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions, which may be sponsored by corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations or associations. group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meetings facilities and catering and banquet services. a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels. as a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotels revenues.
•other revenues. represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels, including our purchasing operations, and other operating income.
•other revenues from managed and franchised properties. represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners, either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through monthly program fees related to certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties. the direct reimbursements by hotel owners are primarily for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally employed by us and certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations. we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties, predominately those located outside of the u.s. revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income (loss) or net income (loss). the monthly program fee that is paid by hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels that we manage is based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, as reimbursement for the costs related to our: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance programs. other revenues from managed and franchised properties also includes revenues related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program, which are primarily derived from payments from hotel franchisees and third-party owners of hotels we manage that participate in the program, as well as co-branded credit card providers. we are contractually required to use these fees that we collect solely for these programs.
factors affecting our revenues the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations:
•consumer demand and global economic conditions. consumer demand for our products and services, as well as the products and services of the third parties from which we earn licensing fees, is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. among other factors, declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks reducing or otherwise negatively affecting travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can reduce the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate and/or reduce the revenues and profitability of the operations of our owned and leased hotels. further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers of our hotels. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, several of these factors, as well as health and safety concerns, had a significant effect on global economic conditions and consumer demand for our products and services; however, we have experienced significant recovery in demand during 2022. also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profitability measures. as a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected, are currently subjecting and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility.
•contracts with third-party hotel owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. we depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and hotel franchisees for our management and franchise fee revenues. the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees. our relationships with these third parties allow us to maintain our current presence as contracts mature and also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth. growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. we believe that we generally have good relationships with our third-party hotel owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party.
expenses principal components we primarily incur the following expenses:
•owned and leased hotels. reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expenses, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. room expenses include compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff, as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory. other support expenses include: costs associated with property-level management; utilities; sales and marketing; operating hotel spas; operating telephones, parking and other guest recreation; entertainment; and other services. property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance.
•depreciation and amortization. these are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of: (i) amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of blackstone inc. (the "merger"), which primarily include values assigned to management contracts, leases and our hilton honors guest loyalty program intangible asset; (ii) amortization of capitalized software costs; and (iii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
•general and administrative. consists primarily of compensation costs for our corporate employees, including share-based compensation; professional fees, including consulting, audit and legal fees; travel and entertainment expenses; bad debt expenses for uncollectible management, franchise and other fees; and administrative and related expenses.
•other expenses. consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations and other ancillary businesses, along with other operating expenses of the business.
•other expenses from managed and franchised properties. represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally employed by us, or paid from program fees collected from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations, including those related to our brands and shared services programs. we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs. we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed hotels, predominately those located outside of the u.s. other expenses from managed and franchised properties also includes expenses for the operation of our hilton honors guest loyalty program.
factors affecting our costs and expenses the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations:
•fixed expenses. many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed. these expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits. this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, including that which resulted from the covid-19 pandemic.
economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. in addition, any efforts to reduce costs, including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. additionally, the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. the effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs. however, we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions, while continuing to optimize value for the experiences of our customers, owners and hilton employees, supporting the long-term sustainability of our brands and business.
•changes in depreciation and amortization expenses. we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and, as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase. as the finite-lived intangible assets that were recorded at the merger become fully amortized, amortization expense will decrease. additionally, changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels or corporate facilities through sale, closure or lease termination, lease renewals, expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. as we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. if we are required to recognize impairment losses related to our depreciable assets or finite-lived intangible assets, the related depreciation or amortization expense, respectively, will decrease.
other items effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is usd, and we have assets and liabilities, including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries, denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. as a result, we are required to translate the results of those operations, assets and liabilities from their functional currency into usd at market-based foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period. when comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods. we hedge foreign currency exchange-based cash flow variability of certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments. we also hold short-term forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances and intercompany financing arrangements, and we have not currently elected to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments.
seasonality the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. while results were less predictable as a result of covid-19 and related travel restrictions, based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.
key business and financial metrics used by management comparable hotels we define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open january 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results were not available. of the 7,085 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2022, 5,797 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. our 1,288 non-comparable hotels included 272 hotels, or less than four percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, underwent large-scale capital projects or comparable results were otherwise not available.
when considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels, no hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any time as a result of the covid-19 pandemic was excluded from the definition of comparable hotels on that basis alone. despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations, we believe that including these hotels within our hotel operating statistics of occupancy, average daily rate ("adr") and revenue per available room ("revpar"), if they would have otherwise been included, reflects the underlying results of our business for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. occupancy levels also help management determine achievable adr pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.
adr adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.
revpar revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and adr. revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.
references to occupancy, adr and revpar are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of december 31, 2022, and references to adr and revpar are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. as such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 or 2019 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the company's foreign operations within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2022.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("ff&e") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items.
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. for instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. for adjusted ebitda, we also exclude items such as: (i) ff&e replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our operating performance.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with gaap. further, ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools, including:
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

we experienced significant improvement in our results during the year ended december 31, 2022 with the continued recovery of the travel and hospitality industry from the covid-19 pandemic and the rebound of cross-border international travel. on a regional basis, the europe region had the most significant improvement when compared to 2021, with continental europe leading the region with meaningful increases in both adr and occupancy. further, despite the impact of the limited demand in china due to prolonged travel restrictions, the remainder of the apac region demonstrated a strong recovery, particularly during the second half of the year. overall, leisure transient was the primary driver of improved performance during the year, but all customer segments, including business and group travel, contributed to our recovery.
on a system-wide basis, our recovery was particularly strong during the second half of 2022, driven by an upward trend in both adr and occupancy. the third quarter of 2022 was the first period since the beginning of the pandemic that system-wide revpar on a comparable and currency neutral basis exceeded system-wide revpar for the same period in 2019, and system-wide revpar for the fourth quarter of 2022 also exceeded the same period in 2019. during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2019, revpar was down 1.3 percent due to a decrease in occupancy of 6.2 percentage points, partially offset by an increase in adr of 7.8 percent. all regions showed improvement in adr during the year ended december 31, 2022 when compared to 2019, with the exception of asia pacific, primarily as a result of limitations on travel in china.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, revenue recognized from fees increased primarily as a result of improved demand for travel and tourism, including the ability and desire of our customers to travel, due to the ongoing recovery that began in early 2021 from the negative impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
accordingly, on a comparable basis, franchise and management fees increased as a result of increases in revpar of 34.8 percent and 69.0 percent at our comparable franchised and managed properties, respectively. these increases were a result of increased occupancy of 8.7 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, and increased adr of 18.0 percent and 27.1 percent, respectively.
further, as new hotels enter our system, we expect such hotels to increase our franchise and management fees. including new development and ownership type transfers, from january 1, 2021 to december 31, 2022, we added over 670 franchised and managed properties on a net basis, providing an additional 105,300 rooms to our management and franchise segment, which also contributed to the increases in franchise and management fees.
the rise in travel and tourism and increased overall consumer spending during the year ended december 31, 2022 also contributed to a significant increase in licensing and other fees from our strategic partnerships and hgv. increased fees from our strategic partnerships resulted from new cardholder acquisitions, as well as increased cardholder spend under our co-branded credit card arrangements and increased fees from hgv resulted from increased timeshare revenues, which, in addition to the recovery from the pandemic, were attributable to the increase in timeshare properties in our system during the period.
incentive management fees increased as they are based on hotels' operating profits, which have improved from the prior year as a result of increased demand in line with the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic and higher revenues driving higher managed hotel profits.

the increase in owned and leased hotels revenues included increases of $489 million and $74 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by an $85 million decrease as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the currency neutral increase in revenues from our comparable leased hotels was primarily the result of increased revpar of 168.2 percent, due to increases in occupancy of 30.8 percentage points and adr of 34.1 percent, reflective of the ongoing recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, which was particularly strong during 2022 in europe where the majority of our leased properties are located. the currency neutral increase in revenues from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels, which also benefited from an increase in revpar, was partially offset by a $35 million decrease, on a currency neutral basis, from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021.

the increase in owned and leased hotels expenses included increases of $358 million and $49 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by a $87 million decrease as a result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the currency neutral increase in expenses from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels was net of a $30 million currency neutral decrease from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021.
our owned and leased hotels had currency neutral increases in certain operating expenses as a result of increased occupancy, including labor costs, utilities and variable rent, which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits, which increased in line with the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, we incurred increased expenses related to ff&e replacement reserves, which are generally computed as a percentage of hotel revenues.

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense, driven by the full amortization of certain software project costs during 2021 and 2022.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to continued cost control and decreased share-based compensation expense, as well as costs recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021 for certain legal settlements, for which no such expenses were recognized during 2022.
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher volume in our purchasing operations related to improved hotel demand.

(1)fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
the increase in interest expense included increases related to the interest rate increase on the variable rate senior secured term loan facility (the "term loan") during the period and the amortization of previously dedesignated interest rate swaps. these increases were partially offset by a decrease related to our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), which was partially drawn during 2021, but was fully repaid as of june 30, 2021 with no outstanding balance for the remainder of 2021 or at all during 2022, as well as a decrease resulting from the february 2021 issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes, which reduced the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding senior unsecured notes. see note 8: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and the associated interest rates.
the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany financing arrangements, including short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, and other transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
loss on debt extinguishment related to the february 2021 redemption of senior unsecured notes and included a redemption premium of $55 million and the accelerated recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs on those senior unsecured notes of $14 million.
other non-operating income, net consists of interest income, equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates, certain components of net periodic pension cost or credit related to our employee defined benefit pension plans and other non-operating gains and losses. the increase in other non-operating income, net was primarily due to an $11 million gain recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022 resulting from the remeasurement of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates, as well as an increase in interest income due to increases in interest rates during the period.
the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the increase in income before income taxes. further, during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized tax benefits as a result of the change in tax rate implemented as part of the united kingdom's finance act 2021. for additional information, see note 12: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources overview as of december 31, 2022, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $1,286 million, including $77 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for ff&e reserves.
our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including:
•costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels;
•corporate expenses;
•payroll and compensation costs;
•taxes and compliance costs;
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to be approximately $427 million in 2023;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to be approximately $47 million and $147 million, respectively, in 2023;
•costs, other than compensation and rent as noted separately, associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels, including, but not limited to, utilities and operating supplies;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital and maintenance expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment;
•dividends as declared; and
•share repurchases.
our known long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for:
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to total an aggregate of $10.5 billion after december 31, 2023;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to total an aggregate of $150 million and $1,068 million, respectively, after december 31, 2023;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment;
•corporate capital and information technology expenditures;
•dividends as declared;
•share repurchases; and
•commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these owners through program fees to operate our marketing, sales and brands programs.
in march 2022, we resumed share repurchases, which we had previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the covid-19 pandemic. since they were resumed, as of december 31, 2022, we had repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of our common stock for $1,608 million. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $3.1 billion remained available for share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. in june 2022, we resumed payment of regular quarterly cash dividends, which we had also previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the pandemic.
in circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objective of growing our global hotel network, we may provide performance or debt guarantees or loan commitments, as necessary, to owners of certain hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise, as applicable, as well as letters of credit that support hotel financing or other obligations of hotel owners. see note 18: "commitments and contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these commitments that were outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
we have a long-term investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. within the framework of our investment policy, we currently intend to continue to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2022, cash generated from our operations and, as needed, the use of the available capacity of our revolving credit facility. additionally, we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing as a source of liquidity as required and to extend maturities of existing borrowings, as necessary.
after considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and other compensation costs, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions. the objectives of our cash management policy are maintaining the availability of liquidity and minimizing operational costs.
we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt and/or purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. issuances or incurrence of new debt (or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt) and/or purchases or retirements of outstanding debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment, largely as a result of an increase in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 41.2 percent. additionally, there was a $119 million decrease in payments of contract acquisition costs based on the timing of certain strategic hotel developments supporting our net unit growth. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $208 million increase in cash paid for income taxes primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes.
in april 2020, we pre-sold hilton honors points to american express and, before the end of the second quarter of 2022, all of those points had been used by american express. as such, american express resumed purchasing hilton honors points with cash in connection with a co-branded credit card arrangement with them, which contributed approximately $400 million to the increase in our operating cash flows during the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect american express to continue to purchase points with cash under the co-branded credit card arrangement in future periods.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily included: (i) capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations; (ii) capital expenditures for property and equipment related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment; and (iii) equity and debt financing that we provided to unconsolidated affiliates and owners of hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise to support our strategic objectives. during the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the net cash inflows resulting from our undesignated derivative financial instruments that we have in place to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of the british pound depreciating against the usd during the year ended december 31, 2022.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily related to the return of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases, which resumed in march 2022, and quarterly dividend payments, which resumed in june 2022, after both programs were suspended in 2020. net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily comprised the full repayment of the $1.69 billion outstanding debt balance on our revolving credit facility, as well as the debt issuance costs and redemption premiums associated with the issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes.
debt and borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately $8.8 billion, and we had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of $1,690 million. in january 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion, $250 million of which is available in the form of letters of credit, and, based on the terms of the agreement, we expect the extended maturity date to be january 2028. as of february 3, 2023, after considering $60 million letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding, we had an available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility of $1,940 million. for additional information on our total indebtedness, including any applicable guarantees, refer to note 8: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. however, we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to may 2025. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances. while we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
we believe that the following estimates, which are used in conjunction with our significant accounting policies, are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and are based on information that is inherently uncertain; refer to note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements for information on our significant accounting policies. management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors:
impairment of goodwill and brands intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 17: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements.
as part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment, we exercise judgment to:
•perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations and historical experience;
•decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. factors we consider when making this determination include changes in the company or general economic conditions since the previous quantitative assessment was performed, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at that time and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment; and
•perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment loss. the estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of the reporting unit or brand, as applicable.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
impairment of certain finite-lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets, operating and finance lease rou assets and property and equipment for indicators of impairment, and, if such indicators exist, we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the determined asset group, by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the asset group.
as part of the process, we exercise judgment to:
•determine if there are indicators of impairment present. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information;
•determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present. judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated performance over the expected useful life of the asset group. forward-looking estimates of future performance are based on historical operating results, adjusted for current and expected future market conditions, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and
•determine the asset group fair value when required. in determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available for a specific asset group, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. the discount rate applied to forward-looking projections takes into account market-specific considerations.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
hilton honors we record a point redemption liability for amounts received from properties participating in our hilton honors guest loyalty program and from strategic partners affiliated with the loyalty program, in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation. we engage third-party actuaries annually to assist in determining the fair value of the future reward redemption obligation using a discount rate and statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment, including: (i) an estimate of points that will eventually be redeemed, which includes an estimate of breakage (i.e., points that will never be redeemed); (ii) the expectation of when such points will be redeemed; and (iii) the cost of reimbursing properties and other third parties when points are redeemed. the cost of the points expected to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights, occupancy rates, room rates and any changes to the hilton honors program, including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward. any amounts received related to the issuance of points that are in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue upon point redemption. we recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point, inclusive of estimated breakage, and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs.
in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program, we earn fees from strategic partnerships, including co-branded credit card arrangements, for a license to use our ip and the issuance of hilton honors points. the allocation of the overall fees from the strategic partnerships between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices. the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation method incorporating statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment, including estimates of the usage of the strategic partner's goods or services, an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate applied to the projected cash flows. the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the strategic partnerships is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above, adjusted for an appropriate margin.
changes in our estimates and assumptions that are used to determine our estimated cost per point and the allocation of fees from strategic partnerships between the ip license fee and the hilton honors points could result in material changes in the balances of our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets. further, the estimates and assumptions used for the allocation of fees could result in material changes to our licensing fees and other revenues from managed and franchised properties recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. in performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 12: "income taxes" for information on the balances of our deferred tax assets and respective valuation allowances as of december 31, 2022.
we use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized, we assume, among other items, the position will be examined, the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position will be based on its technical merits. further, estimates based on the technical merits of each evaluated tax position and the amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit (expense), which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss in determining whether an accrual of an estimated loss is appropriate. changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.

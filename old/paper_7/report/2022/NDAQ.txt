the following chart summarizes our arr (in millions):
arr for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. this excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. also excluded are contracts that are signed but not yet commenced. arr is one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. arr does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. arr should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. arr is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating arr may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.
the arr chart includes:
▪        anti-financial crime support and saas subscription contracts
▪        proprietary market data subscriptions and annual listing fees within our data &amp; listing services business, index data subscriptions and guaranteed minimum on futures contracts within our index business and subscription contracts under our workflow &amp; insights business.
▪        market technology support and saas subscription contracts as well as trade management services contracts, excluding one-time service requests.
the following chart summarizes our quarterly annualized saas revenues for our solutions businesses, which are comprised of the capital access platforms and anti-financial crime segments and the marketplace technology business within the market platforms segment, for the three months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):

section 31 fees are recorded as equity derivative and cash equity derivative trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded in transaction-based expenses. we are assessed these fees from the sec and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. pass-through fees can increase or decrease due to rate changes by the sec, our percentage of the overall industry volumes processed on our systems, and differences in actual dollar value traded. the sec implemented a fee increase in may 2022 and a decrease in february 2021. since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded as section 31 fees, there is no impact on our net revenues.

in the table above, signed arr reflects arr recognized as revenue in the current period as well as arr for new contracts signed but not yet commenced. we began tracking signed arr in 2021 following our acquisition of verafin, and thus there is no available metric for 2020.
anti-financial crime revenues increased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to an increase in demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions and strong performance by our surveillance business in new sales to existing clients and new customer acquisitions. the increase was also driven by a $28 million purchase price adjustment on verafin deferred revenue in 2021 and the inclusion of a full year of verafin revenues in 2022. the increase in 2021 compared with 2020 was due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of verafin and growth in our surveillance solutions.
other revenues other revenues include revenues related to our nordic broker services business, for which we completed the wind-down in june 2022, as well as revenues associated with our u.s. fixed income business, which was sold in june 2021. prior to the closing of the transaction, these revenues were included in our market platforms and capital access platforms segments. see "2021 divestiture," of note 4, "acquisitions and divestiture," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this divestiture. additionally, for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, other revenues include revenues associated with the npm business which we contributed in july 2021 to a standalone, independent company, of which we own the largest minority interest, together with a consortium of third-party financial institutions. prior to july 2021, these revenues were included in our capital access platforms segment. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, other revenues also include a transitional services agreement associated with a divested business.

the increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2022 compared with 2021 was primarily driven by continued investment in employees to drive growth and inflationary pressures, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $42 million.
headcount, including employees of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries, increased to 6,377 employees as of december 31, 2022 from 5,814 as of december 31, 2021 reflecting growth across each of our three segments.
professional and contract services expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates and a decrease in legal fees, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs.
computer operations and data communications expense increased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher software costs and higher costs related to new cloud initiatives.
occupancy expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
general, administrative and other expense increased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to an accrual related to a legal matter and higher travel costs.
marketing and advertising expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021, reflecting lower ipo activity.
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 due to an impairment charge of $14 million in 2021 related to a finite-lived intangible asset for customer relationships associated with the wind down of a previous acquisition and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
regulatory expense decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 due to a charge in 2021 associated with an administrative fine issued by the sfsa. see "nasdaq commodities clearing default," of note 15, "clearing operations," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sfsa administrative fine.
we have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. these expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs and vary based on the size and frequency of the activities described above.

interest expense increased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest rates related to borrowings under our commercial paper program.
the net gain on divestiture of business in 2021 relates to the sale of our u.s. fixed income business, which was part of our ficc business within our market services segment. we recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $84 million, net of disposal costs. see "2021 divestiture," of note 4, "acquisitions and divestiture," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
other income decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to gains from strategic investments related to our corporate venture program in the prior year.

non-gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, we also provide non-gaap net income attributable to nasdaq and non-gaap diluted earnings per share. management uses this non-gaap information internally, along with u.s. gaap information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. we believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance.
these measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, u.s. gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. this non-gaap information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with u.s. gaap. we recommend investors review the u.s. gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. when viewed in conjunction with our u.s. gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these non-gaap measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than u.s. gaap measures alone.
we understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-gaap financial measures, such as non-gaap net income attributable to nasdaq and non-gaap diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. we use non-gaap net income attributable to nasdaq and non-gaap diluted earnings per share because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on u.s. gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. we believe that excluding the following items from the non-gaap net income attributable to nasdaq provides a more meaningful analysis of nasdaq's ongoing operating performance and comparisons in nasdaq's performance between periods:
•amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: we amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. as such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses and the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods.
•merger and strategic initiatives expense: we have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. the frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. these expenses primarily include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs.
•restructuring charges: in 2022, following our september announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. in 2019, we initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance our strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue the realignment of certain business areas. see note 20, "restructuring charges," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our 2022 divisional alignment program as well as our 2019 restructuring plan, which was completed in june 2021.
•net income from unconsolidated investee: our income on our investment in occ may vary significantly compared to prior periods due to the changes in occ's capital management policy. see "equity method investments," of note 6, "investments," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
•other items: we have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. for the year ended december 31, 2022, other items include accruals related to a legal matter, included in general, administrative and other expense in our consolidated statements of income and a regulatory matter offset by the release of $5 million in relation to the reduction of the administrative fine issued by the sfsa both recorded in regulatory expense in our consolidated statements of income. for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 other items also include a loss on extinguishment of debt, included in general, administrative and other expense in our consolidated statements of income and net gains and losses from strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program, included in other income in our consolidated statements of income. for the year ended december 31, 2021, other items included a charge related to an administrative fine imposed by the sfsa. the 2022 and 2021 sfsa charges associated with the default that occurred in 2018, are included in regulatory expense in our consolidated statements of income. see "nasdaq commodities clearing default," of note 15, "clearing operations," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. for the year ended december 31, 2021, other items also included a net gain on divestiture of businesses, which represents our pre-tax net gain of $84 million on the sale of our u.s. fixed income business.
•significant tax items: the non-gaap adjustment to the income tax provision for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily includes the tax impact of each non-gaap adjustment. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2021, the non-gaap adjustment to the income tax provision includes adjustments related to return-to-provision and a prior year tax benefit.

liquidity and capital resources historically, we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through cash generated by operations, augmented by the periodic issuance of debt. currently, our cost and availability of funding remain healthy. we continue to prudently assess our capital deployment strategy through balancing acquisitions, internal investments, debt repayments, and shareholder return activity, including share repurchases and dividends.
in the near term, we expect that our operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt repayments, any share repurchases and any dividends.
the value of various assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the current portion of long-term debt, and commercial paper, can fluctuate from month to month. working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) was $(231) million as of december 31, 2022, compared with $(449) million as of december 31, 2021, an increase of $218 million. the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in short-term debt and increases in cash and cash equivalents and receivables, net, partially offset by increases in section 31 fees payable to the sec and deferred revenue and decreases in other current assets and financial investments.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally-generated funds include:
•    deterioration of our revenues in any of our business segments;
•    changes in regulatory and working capital requirements; and
•an increase in our expenses.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•    operating covenants contained in our credit facilities that limit our total borrowing capacity;
•    credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt;
•    a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock; and
•    volatility or disruption in the public debt and equity markets.

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents includes all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, and alternative investment choices. as of december 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents of $502 million were primarily invested in bank deposits, money market funds and commercial paper. in the long-term, we may use both internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2022 increased $109 million from december 31, 2021.
repatriation of cash our cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u.s. in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $275 million as of december 31, 2022 and $266 million as of december 31, 2021. the remaining balance held in the u.s. totaled $227 million as of december 31, 2022 and $127 million as of december 31, 2021.
unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries outside of the u.s. are used to finance our international operations and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

we have adjusted the presentation of the 2020 opening and ending amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows to include restricted cash and cash equivalents related to the default funds and margin deposits. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this adjustment.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items such as: depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment; amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets; expense associated with share-based compensation; deferred income taxes; expense associated with extinguishment of debt; net gain on divestiture of business; and net income from unconsolidated investees.
net cash provided by operating activities is also impacted by the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities such as: accounts receivable and deferred revenue which are impacted by the timing of customer billings and related collections from our customers; accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments; accrued personnel costs, which are impacted by employee performance targets and the timing of payments related to employee bonus incentives; and section 31 fees payable to the sec, which is impacted by the changes in sec fee rates and the timing of collections from customers and payments to the sec.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $623 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. the increase was primarily driven by section 31 fees payable to the sec due to higher sec fee rates in 2022 and cash payments made in the second quarter of 2021 related to the acquisition of verafin, including a tax obligation paid on behalf of verafin of $221 million and a cash payment of $102 million, the release of which was subject to certain employment-related conditions following the closing of the acquisition of verafin. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the remaining amount of the $102 million was accelerated and paid to the eligible former verafin employees. the remaining change was primarily due to other fluctuations in our working capital.

in the table above, the 2024 notes were reclassified to short-term debt as of march 31, 2022, and were repaid in april 2022.
in december 2022, nasdaq amended and restated the 2020 credit facility with a new maturity date of december 16, 2027. in addition to the 2022 credit facility, we also have other credit facilities primarily to support our nasdaq clearing operations in europe, as well as to provide a cash pool credit line for one subsidiary. these credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, totaled $184 million as of december 31, 2022 and $212 million as of december 31, 2021 in available liquidity, none of which was utilized.
as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.
see note 9, "debt obligations," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.
contractual obligations and contingent commitments nasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, operating lease payments, and other obligations. the following table summarizes material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2022, and the estimated timing thereof.

in the table above:
•debt obligations by contractual maturity include both principal and interest obligations. as of december 31, 2022, an interest rate of 4.4% was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligations for interest on the 2022 credit facility. all other debt obligations were primarily calculated on a 365-day basis at the contractual fixed rate multiplied by the aggregate principal amount as of december 31, 2022. see note 9, "debt obligations," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
•operating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of december 31, 2022, as well as legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. see note 16, "leases," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our leases.
•purchase obligations primarily represent minimum outstanding obligations due under software license agreements. the balance as of december 31, 2022 is primarily comprised of our multi-year aws partnership contract, which replaces our previous shorter term contracts, including those with no minimum spend commitment, and is not expected to increase our overall spend footprint with aws over the life of the contract, based on projected growth and expansion of our existing aws-based solutions.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. we are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities.
we have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. we identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on a daily basis.
we perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures. we may use derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to our financial positions or risks that are incurred during the normal course of business. we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
interest rate risk we are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financial investments and debt obligations, which are discussed below.
financial investments as of december 31, 2022, our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of highly rated european government debt securities, which pay a fixed rate of interest. these securities are subject to interest rate risk and the fair value of these securities will decrease if market interest rates increase. if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by a hypothetical 100 basis points from levels as of december 31, 2022, the fair value of this portfolio would decline by $3 million.
debt obligations as of december 31, 2022, the majority of our debt obligations were fixed-rate obligations. interest rates on certain tranches of notes are subject to adjustment to the extent our debt rating is downgraded below investment grade, as further discussed in note 9, "debt obligations," to the consolidated financial statements. while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations, we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the borrowings under our 2022 credit facility, as this facility has a variable interest rate. we are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper under our commercial paper program, which have variable interest rates. as of december 31, 2022, we had principal amounts outstanding of $664 million of commercial paper and no amounts outstanding under our 2022 credit facility. a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates on our outstanding commercial paper would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $7 million based on borrowings as of december 31, 2022.
we may utilize interest rate swap agreements to achieve a desired mix of variable and fixed rate debt.
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. our primary transactional exposure to foreign currency denominated revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the following tables:

credit risk credit risk is the potential loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of customers or counterparties. we are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. we limit our exposure to credit risk by evaluating the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements. for our investment portfolio, our objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. credit risk associated with investments is minimized substantially by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments which have investment grade ratings, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
our subsidiary, nasdaq execution services, may be exposed to credit risk due to the default of trading counterparties in connection with the routing services it provides for our trading customers. system trades in cash equities routed to other market centers for members of our cash equity exchanges are routed by nasdaq execution services for clearing to the nscc. in this function, nasdaq execution services is to be neutral by the end of the trading day, but may be exposed to intraday risk if a trade extends beyond the trading day and into the next day, thereby leaving nasdaq execution services susceptible to counterparty risk in the period between accepting the trade and routing it to the clearinghouse. in this interim period, nasdaq execution services is not novating like a clearing broker but instead is subject to the short-term risk of counterparty failure before the clearinghouse enters the transaction. once the clearinghouse officially accepts the trade for novation, nasdaq execution services is legally removed from trade execution risk. however, nasdaq has membership obligations to nscc independent of nasdaq execution services' arrangements.
pursuant to the rules of the nscc and nasdaq execution services' clearing agreement, nasdaq execution services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agent's failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. however, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as nasdaq execution services' customers are not permitted to trade on margin and nscc rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limits and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with nscc. historically, nasdaq execution services has never incurred a liability due to a customer's failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.
we have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears. our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets. we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties' creditworthiness. credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
we also are exposed to credit risk through our clearing operations with nasdaq clearing. see note 15, "clearing operations," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. our clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits, which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearinghouse may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
•credit risk. when the clearinghouse has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearinghouse utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. when funds are not held at a central bank, we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk by ensuring that investments are primarily placed in large, highly rated financial institutions, highly rated government debt instruments and other creditworthy counterparties.
•liquidity risk. liquidity risk is the risk a clearinghouse may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearinghouse monitors liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or investing in highly liquid government debt instruments serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk. interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. our clearinghouse seeks to manage this risk by making short term investments of members' cash deposits. in addition, the clearinghouse investment guidelines allow for direct purchases or repurchase agreements with short dated maturities of high quality sovereign debt (for example, european government and u.s. treasury securities), central bank certificates and multilateral development bank debt instruments.
•security issuer risk. security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments and collateral under reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign, government agency or multilateral development bank debt instruments.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
revenue recognition market technology revenues as part of our market technology product offering, within our marketplace technology business, we enter into certain long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers which results in these contracts containing multiple performance obligations. we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. in instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach.
we generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. for these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.
accounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity and the complexity of work performed. revenue and cost estimates for our long-term contracts are reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly. when adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. if estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, as discussed above, changes in assumptions and estimates may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.
for further discussion related to recognition of these revenues, see "revenue from contracts with customers - revenue recognition - marketplace technology," of note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and related impairment testing assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, technology, exchange and clearing registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually as of october 1 and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
in september 2022, we announced a new organizational structure which aligns our businesses more closely with the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system. our four previous reportable segments, market services, corporate platforms, investment intelligence and market technology have been changed to align with our new corporate structure that includes three segments: market platforms, capital access platforms and anti-financial crime. under asc 350-20, "intangibles goodwill and other," when a company reorganizes its reporting structure, an impairment test must be performed both before and after the change, and goodwill must be reassigned to reporting units. accordingly, goodwill was reassigned based on relative fair value of each reporting unit.
we perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. for 2022, we performed the goodwill impairment test under our previous organizational structure: market services segment, the two businesses comprising the corporate platforms segment: listing services and corporate solutions, the investment intelligence segment, and the market technology segment, which represented our five reporting units. we also performed the test under our current organization structure, which includes three reporting units: market platforms segment, capital access platforms segment and anti-financial crime segment.
when testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required. our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value or the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value over their respective carrying amounts at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments.
in performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow valuation, which incorporates assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates, as well as guideline public company valuations, which incorporates relevant trading multiples of comparable companies and other factors. the estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit, which are approved by our board of directors. the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value, using the greenfield approach for exchange and clearing registrations and licenses, and the relief from royalty approach or excess earnings approach for trade names, both of which incorporate assumptions regarding future revenue projections and discount rates. if the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.

in 2022 and 2021, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. in conducting the quantitative assessment, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill for each of our reporting units and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets sufficiently exceed their respective carrying amounts. as a result, there were no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment charges recorded in any of those years.
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, the determination of certain valuation inputs is subject to management's judgment. changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of our impairment review. if our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results.
subsequent to our annual impairment test, no indications of impairment were identified.
other long-lived assets and related impairment we review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment, and operating lease assets for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.
there were no material finite-lived intangible assets impairment charges in 2022 and 2020. we recorded an impairment charge of $14 million in 2021 related to a finite-lived intangible asset for customer relationships associated with the wind down of a previous acquisition included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges of $8 million in 2022, $4 million in 2021 and $14 million in 2020. the asset impairment charges in 2022 and 2020 primarily related to capitalized software that was retired and are included in restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income. see note 20, "restructuring charges," to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these plans.
no material impairments were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our other long-lived assets during 2022, 2021 or 2020.
income taxes estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions. we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in such jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. while we believe that our tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of identified tax uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may be greater or less than the amount accrued. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted we have considered all recent accounting pronouncements and have concluded that no accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

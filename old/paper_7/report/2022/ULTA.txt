item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels - department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. we developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. we define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. we estimate beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 65% of shoppers and 80% of beauty products and services spend in the u.s. we believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance.
today, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the united states and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of more than 25,000 beauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than 1,350 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website, ulta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels.
the continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities: 1) drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty; 2) evolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, all in your world; 3) expand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey, solidifying ulta beauty at the heart of the beauty community; 4) drive operational excellence and optimization; 5) protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent; and 6) expand our environmental and social impact. we believe the attractive and growing u.s. beauty products and salon services industry, the expanding definition of beauty and the role that omnichannel capabilities play in consumers' lives, coupled with ulta beauty's competitive strengths, position us to capture additional market share in the industry.
comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. a variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general u.s. economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.
over the long term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel capabilities, and opening new stores. long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the u.s. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.

current trends impact of covid-19
we closely monitor the continuing impact of covid-19 on all facets of our business. while operations during fiscal 2022 did not appear to be negatively impacted, the covid-19 pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic could have negative impacts in the future. the extent of the impact of the pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic on our future business and financial results will depend on, among other things, the potential of temporary restrictions on operating hours, in-store services or reclosing of certain stores or other facilities of ours or our brand partners and other suppliers, supply chain disruptions, increased transportation and shipping costs, higher wholesale costs, increased labor costs, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact of the foregoing on consumer spending.
industry trends our research indicates that ulta beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. however, the covid-19 pandemic and its various impacts changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products, at least temporarily, due to the closures of offices, retail stores, and other businesses and the significant decline in travel, entertainment and social gatherings. the overall beauty market declined in 2020, stabilized in 2021, and expanded in 2022, as consumers resumed in-person shopping while maintaining some of their online shopping behaviors. we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.
impact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends although we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our sales during fiscal 2022, continued pressure from inflation or other evolving macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and could lead to a recession. furthermore, inflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with higher costs. in addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt.
basis of presentation the company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.
we recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. e-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. we provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. state sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with target corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.
comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. comparable sales
32
include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.
measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:
●   the general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;

●   the introduction of new products or brands;

●   the location of new stores in existing store markets;

●   competition;

●   our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;

●   the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and

●   the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.

cost of sales includes:
●   the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;

●   distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance;

●   shipping and handling costs;

●   retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses;

●   salon services payroll and benefits; and

●   shrink and inventory valuation reserves.

our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. this presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses include:
●   payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;

●   advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;

●   occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;

●   stock-based compensation expense;

●   depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and

●   legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.

this presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.
impairment, restructuring and other costs include long-lived asset impairment charges, restructuring costs associated with store closings, costs associated with the suspension of our canadian expansion, and employee related severance costs.
pre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.
33
interest (income) expense, net includes both interest income and expense. interest income represents interest from cash equivalents and short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates.
income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.

fiscal year 2022 versus fiscal year 2021
net sales net sales increased $1.6 billion, or 18.3%, to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021. the net sales increase was primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation, increased social occasions and fewer covid-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021, and an increase of $77.3 million in other revenue. the total comparable sales increase of 15.6% in fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, was driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
gross profit gross profit increased $676.0 million, or 20.1%, to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2022, compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 39.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021. the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to:
●   100 basis points of leverage of fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales and ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts;

●   60 basis points of leverage in other revenue primarily due to credit card income growth, an increase in royalty income from our partnership with target, and higher loyalty point redemptions; and

●   20 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; partially offset by

●   70 basis points of deleverage in inventory shrink; and

●   50 basis points of deleverage in merchandise margins driven by brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in fiscal 2021, partially offset by the timing of retail price changes.

selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $333.8 million, or 16.2%, to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses decreased 40 basis points to 23.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021. the leverage of sg&a expenses was primarily due to:
●   80 basis points of leverage due to lower marketing expenses; and

●   20 basis points of leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales; partially offset by

●   40 basis points of deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments; and

●   20 basis points of deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments.

pre-opening expenses pre-opening expenses increased $1.1 million, or 11.4%, to $10.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021.
interest (income) expense, net interest income, net was $4.9 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.7 million of interest expense, net in fiscal 2021. interest income represents interest from cash equivalents and short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. interest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility. we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of january 28, 2023 and january 29, 2022.
income tax expense income tax expense of $401.1 million in fiscal 2022 represents an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to fiscal 2021 income tax expense of $310.0 million and an effective tax rate of 23.9%. the higher income tax expense is primarily due
35
to less tax benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and an increase in state tax expense compared to fiscal 2021.
net income net income increased $256.6 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021. the increase in net income was primarily due to a $676.0 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $333.8 million increase in sg&a expenses and $91.1 million increase in income taxes.
fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020
net sales net sales increased $2.5 billion, or 40.3%, to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $6.2 billion in fiscal 2020. the net sales increase was primarily due to the favorable impact from stronger consumer confidence, government stimulus payments, and the easing of covid-19 restrictions, and an increase of $15.1 million in other revenue. the total comparable sales increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of 17.9% in fiscal 2020, was driven by a 30.0% increase in transactions and a 6.0% increase in average ticket.
gross profit gross profit increased $1.4 billion, or 72.8%, to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021, compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020. gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 730 basis points to 39.0% in fiscal 2021 compared to 31.7% in fiscal 2020. the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to:
●   300 basis points leverage of fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales;

●   190 basis points of improvements in merchandise margins driven by lower promotional activity and cost optimization efforts;

●   140 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; and

●   100 basis points of leverage in salon expenses attributed to the impact of higher sales.

selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a expenses increased $0.5 billion, or 30.2%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses decreased 180 basis points to 23.9% in fiscal 2021 compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2020. the leverage in sg&a expenses was primarily due to:
●   180 basis points of leverage of corporate overhead due to higher sales;

●   90 basis points of leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales; and

●   50 basis points of leverage of store expenses due to higher sales; partially offset by

●   80 basis points of deleverage due to less employee retention credits received under the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (cares act); and

●   60 basis points of deleverage due to higher incentive compensation.

impairment, restructuring and other costs there were no impairment, restructuring and other costs recognized in fiscal 2021 compared to $114.3 million for fiscal 2020, which consisted of $41.9 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain retail stores, $29.1 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to canada, $27.5 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores, and $15.8 million of severance charges.
36
pre-opening expenses pre-opening expenses decreased $5.5 million, or 36.6%, to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2020 due to current year real estate activity and stores expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
interest expense, net interest expense, net was $1.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $5.7 million of interest expense, net in fiscal 2020. interest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility. interest income results from short-term investments. we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of january 29, 2022 and january 30, 2021.
income tax expense income tax expense of $310.0 million in fiscal 2021 represents an effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to fiscal 2020 income tax expense of $55.3 million and an effective tax rate of 23.9%. the higher income tax expense is primarily due to higher operating income compared to fiscal 2020.
net income net income increased $810.0 million to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $175.8 million in fiscal 2020. the increase in net income was primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in gross profit and a $114.3 million decrease in impairment, restructuring and other costs, partially offset by a $0.5 billion increase in sg&a expenses and $254.7 million increase in income taxes.
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. the most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue. as of january 28, 2023 and january 29, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $737.9 million and $431.6 million, respectively.
our primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our information technology systems.
our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease expenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases. our working capital needs are greatest from august through november each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season.
long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.
we generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. we believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term.

(2)   the unrecognized tax benefit of $4.2 million as of january 28, 2023 is excluded due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows, if any.

purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the company to purchase goods or services. the amount of purchase obligations relates to commitments for products and services and other goods and service contracts entered into as of january 28, 2023. excluded from purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.
cash flows we believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows during the last three years:

fiscal year ended january 28,              january 29,                january 30,
(in thousands)                              2023                    2022                       2021
net cash provided by operating activities       $1,481,915               $1,059,265                 $810,355
net cash used in investing activities                   (314,584)                  (176,484)                 (48,751)
net cash used in financing activities                   (861,014)                (1,497,216)                (107,934)
operating activities operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, long-lived asset impairment charges, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes.
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 is mainly due to the increase in net income, a smaller increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2022, and the timing of receivable collections, partially offset by the timing of payables and a smaller increase in deferred revenue compared to fiscal 2021.
the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales, partially offset by an increase in sg&a expenses and income taxes.
merchandise inventories, net were $1.6 billion at january 28, 2023, compared to $1.5 billion at january 29, 2022, representing an increase of $104.2 million or 7.0%. the increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:
●   $54 million increase due to the addition of 47 new stores opened since january 29, 2022;

●   $25 million increase due to new key brand launches; and

●   $25 million increase primarily due to inventory cost increases.

38
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the increase in net income and deferred revenue, partially offset by higher merchandise inventories, higher cash outflow from higher income taxes, and lower long-lived asset impairment charges compared to fiscal 2020.
investing activities we have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments, and investments in information technology systems. investment activities for capital expenditures were $312.1 million during fiscal 2022, compared to $172.2 million during fiscal 2021.
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to more capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2021.
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to less proceeds of short-term investments and more capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2020.
capital expenditures the following table presents a summary of our store activities during the last three years:

fiscal year ended january 28,         january 29,         january 30,
2023                2022         2021
stores opened                   47                  48         30
stores remodeled                20                   9         -
stores relocated                12                   7         5
during fiscal 2022, the average investment required to open a new ulta beauty store was approximately $1.7 million, which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory net of payables.
capital expenditures during the last three years by major category are as follows:

budget fiscal          fiscal          fiscal          fiscal
(in millions)                          2023                     2022            2021            2020
new, remodeled, and relocated stores       $156            $102            $73             $56
merchandising and refreshed stores                48              34              16              14
information technology systems                   108              74              37              36
supply chain                                     113              70              23              13
store maintenance and other                       50              32              23              33
total                                      $475            $312            $172            $152
our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems investments, and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures. we expect fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will be up to $475 million and will be used primarily to fund our new, remodeled, and relocated stores and strategic priorities, including investments in information technology systems and supply chain optimization.
39
financing activities financing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions. purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases.
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases offset by an increase in stock option exercises, and no activity under our revolving credit facility.
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. the zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including sales demand, overall performance of management initiatives including expense control, and inventory and other working capital reductions. we may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods for unexpected business disruptions, to support our new store program, seasonal inventory needs, or share repurchases.
share repurchase program in march 2020, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2020 share repurchase program) pursuant to which the company could repurchase up to $1.6 billion of the company's common stock. the 2020 share repurchase program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. the 2020 share repurchase program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.
in march 2022, the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2022 share repurchase program) pursuant to which the company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the company's common stock. the 2022 share repurchase program authorization revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2020 share repurchase program. the 2022 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
a summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:

fiscal year ended january 28,              january 29,              january 30,
(dollars in millions)              2023                         2022                     2021
shares repurchased                             2,192,556                4,249,632                474,794
total cost of shares repurchased       $900.0                   $1,521.9                 $114.9
credit facility on march 11, 2020, we entered into amendment no. 1 to the second amended and restated loan agreement (as so amended, the loan agreement) with wells fargo bank, national association, as administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender thereunder; wells fargo bank, national association and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as lead arrangers and bookrunners; jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as syndication agent and a lender; pnc bank, national association, as documentation agent and a lender; and the other lenders party thereto. the loan agreement matures on march 11, 2025, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $1.0 billion or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the company and satisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $100.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. the loan agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the loan agreement falls below a specified threshold.
40
substantially all of the company's assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement. outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the company's election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.125% or the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.250%, with such margins based on the company's borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.20% per annum.
as of january 28, 2023 and january 29, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the loan agreement.
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. to a lesser extent, our business is also affected by mother's day and valentine's day. any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. as such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. actual results may differ from these estimates. a discussion of our more significant estimates follows. management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors.
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. these estimates are based on management's judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be affected by adjustments to these estimates.
inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. we record a shrink reserve representing management's estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. this estimate is based on management's analysis of historical results and operating trends.
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves. adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management's estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. an increase or decrease in the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022. an increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022.
41
vendor allowances the majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendors' products. we estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management's analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors. we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory. an increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022.
impairment of long-lived tangible assets we review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable. assets are primarily reviewed at the store level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. an impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges. during fiscal 2020, we recognized $72.5 million of impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets which consisted of $41.9 million due to the carrying values of certain long-lived assets exceeding their respective fair values, $19.6 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to canada, and $11.0 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores. no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.
loyalty program we maintain a customer loyalty program, ultamate rewards, which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services. points earned are valid for at least one year. the loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services. revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire. we defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed. the amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed. the expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends. the standalone selling price of points earned and the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate.
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management's estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. an increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5% would not have a material impact on our operating income in fiscal 2022.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states. judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
we recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized in full. the estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is
42
recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities.
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

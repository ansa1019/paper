initiatives and recent developments our initiatives, as well as other recent developments that have had or are expected to have an impact on our business or results of operations are listed below:
•dollar tree
◦in september 2021, we announced our new $1.25 price point initiative and we completed the rollout of this initiative to all dollar tree stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, increasing the price point on a majority of our $1 merchandise to $1.25. to date, the increase in the price point has more than offset the decline in the number of units sold. during fiscal 2022, we began investing in new products and modifying existing products to provide greater value for our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. while our gross margin was higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, because of the investments in new products, the increase was not as high as it was in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 and we expect dollar tree's gross margin to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2023.
◦we began testing the instacart online delivery service at dollar tree stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and began rolling it out in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. as of january 28, 2023, the instacart platform covers more than 7,800 dollar tree stores. this enables our customers to shop online and receive same-day delivery without having to visit a store.
◦in fiscal 2022, we continued to implement our dollar tree plus initiative which introduces products priced at the $3 and $5 price points and provides our customers with extraordinary value in discretionary categories. as of january 28, 2023, we have approximately 2,500 dollar tree plus stores. we plan to accelerate the implementation of the dollar tree plus initiative in fiscal 2023 by adding the concept to an additional 1,800, or more, stores. in addition, beginning in fiscal 2022, we added $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product to 3,500 stores.
◦the rollout of our crafter's square initiative to all of our dollar tree stores was completed during fiscal 2020. the crafter's square assortment carries mark-ups which are higher than our average mark-up.
•family dollar
◦in fiscal 2022, we continued to implement our h2 initiative. our h2 stores have significantly improved merchandise offerings throughout the store, including the addition of dollar tree $1.25 merchandise items and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors. these stores have higher customer traffic and provide a higher average comparable store net sales lift, when compared to non-renovated stores, in the first year following renovation. h2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our family dollar stores have been most challenged in the past. as of january 28, 2023, we have approximately 4,360 h2 stores.
◦building on the success of the h2 format, in march 2021, we announced the development of a new combination store format. combo stores leverage the strengths of the dollar tree and family dollar brands under one roof to serve small towns across the country. we are taking family dollar's great value and assortment and blending in select dollar tree merchandise categories, creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3,000 to 4,000 residents. as of january 28, 2023, we operated approximately 810 combo stores.
◦after a successful pilot program in 2020, we entered into a partnership with instacart in february 2021, which covers more than 7,500 family dollar stores across the united states as of january 28, 2023.
◦we added adult beverage to approximately 570 stores in fiscal 2022. we believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment drives traffic to our stores. as of january 28, 2023, there were more than 3,300 stores selling adult beverage products.
◦on february 11, 2022, the food and drug administration issued form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at our west memphis, arkansas distribution center ("dc 202"), as well as other items that require remediation. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, approximately 400 stores serviced by dc 202 were temporarily closed in connection with a retail-level product recall. we incurred approximately $65.0 million in costs related to the product recall, remediation efforts and asset impairment during fiscal 2022. remediation-related costs included merchandise disposal costs, payroll and legal costs.
•strategic investments building on our current initiatives, we are currently developing plans to make additional multi-year strategic investments across both banners to further position the company for long-term sustained growth. we anticipate that these investments will relate to four key areas of our business: our associates, our distribution center network and supply chain, our product pricing and value proposition, and our technology infrastructure. within these areas, the focus of these investments is expected to be on associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased supply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing at family dollar, and enhancements to our systems infrastructure.
•supply chain
◦inventory: during fiscal 2021, we experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain which impacted our ability to ship products from overseas on a timely basis. during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 these challenges subsided; however, as a result of receiving inventory more timely, our inventory levels exceeded the storage capacity of some of our distribution centers. as a result, we arranged for temporary offsite warehouse storage facilities and incurred detention costs and incremental drayage costs that increased our cost of goods sold.
◦freight costs: we experienced significantly higher international and domestic freight costs as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain during the second half of fiscal 2021 and into the first half of fiscal 2022. domestically, diesel fuel prices were higher in fiscal 2022 than in the prior year and may increase further in fiscal 2023 because of international tensions. we are a large importer of merchandise from asia and rely heavily on domestic freight to transport goods to our distribution centers and stores, which makes us particularly sensitive to freight costs. due to these trends, in fiscal 2022, import and domestic freight costs were higher compared to fiscal 2021; however, we expect freight costs to be lower in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022.
•long-term debt
◦during the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million of 2.65% senior notes due 2031 and $400.0 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty and we accelerated the expensing of $2.7 million of deferred financing and original issue discount costs associated with the 2023 notes;
◦during the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into a credit agreement for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which replaced our then-existing $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.
for additional information regarding the risks related to our business and operations, including risks relating to the implementation of our initiatives, see "item 1a. risk factors."
overview we are a leading operator of more than 16,300 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price of $1.25. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. first is our success at opening new stores. second is the performance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand.
at january 28, 2023, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 28, 2023 and january 29, 2022 is as follows:

the average size of stores opened in 2022 was approximately 8,660 selling square feet (or about 10,710 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 9,160 selling square feet (or about 11,210 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. for 2023, we continue to plan to open stores that are 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for both the dollar tree segment and the family dollar segment. we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits.
fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 each included 52 weeks.

comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
results of operations our results of operations and year-over-year changes are discussed in the following section. note that gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. the selling, general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue.

the increase in net sales from 2021 to 2022 was a result of comparable store net sales increases in the dollar tree and family dollar segments and sales of $758.6 million at new stores.
enterprise comparable store net sales increased 5.9% in 2022, as a result of an 8.9% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in customer traffic. comparable store net sales increased 9.0% in the dollar tree segment and increased 2.4% in the family dollar segment.

the increase in gross profit margin from 2021 to 2022 was a result of the net of the following:
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 255 basis points resulting primarily from higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise on the family dollar segment.
•occupancy costs decreased 30 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•distribution costs decreased 5 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and higher capitalized amounts resulting from increases in inventory levels, partially offset by higher maintenance and compliance costs and higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•shrink costs increased 30 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•markdown costs increased 45 basis points primarily due to higher promotional and clearance markdowns on the family dollar segment and higher clearance markdowns resulting from a move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point on the dollar tree segment.

expense rate the increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate from 2021 to 2022 was the result of the following:
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points primarily due to long-lived asset impairments related to certain family dollar stores and the family dollar west memphis, arkansas distribution center, higher legal fees, including costs related to the reconstitution of the board of directors, unfavorable development of general liability claims and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.
•store facility costs increased 35 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates, higher utility costs and costs associated with the removal of product from certain family dollar stores in connection with the retail-level product recall.
•payroll expenses increased 10 basis points primarily due to minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll and higher stock compensation expenses, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•depreciation and amortization expense was unchanged as a percentage of total revenue, as capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements were offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.

interest expense, net decreased $53.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year, resulting from the refinancing of our debt in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in prepayment penalties of $43.8 million and the acceleration of the expensing of $2.7 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs. higher interest income on investments more than offset interest expense on credit facility borrowings in the current year.

the effective tax rate for 2022 was 23.5% compared to 18.6% for 2021. the 2022 effective rate increased compared to the prior year rate primarily due to a deferred tax benefit in the prior year related to state entity restructuring as well as higher non-deductible executive compensation and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax income in the current year.
segment information we operate more than 16,300 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income. the codm reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. if the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. corporate, support and other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. these costs include operating expenses for our store support center and the results of operations for our summit pointe property in chesapeake, virginia. the family dollar segment "operating income" includes advertising revenue, which is a component of "other revenue" in the accompanying consolidated income statements.

net sales for the dollar tree segment increased $1,483.6 million, or 10.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to an increase in comparable store net sales of 9.0% and $372.8 million of new store sales. average ticket increased 13.4% and customer traffic declined 3.9% in 2022. net sales were positively impacted by our $1.25 price point initiative which increased the selling price of the majority of our $1 merchandise to $1.25. the rollout of this initiative was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. the increase in price point more than offset the decline in the number of units sold during the year.
gross profit margin for the dollar tree segment increased to 37.5% in 2022 from 33.1% in 2021. the increase is due to the net of the following:
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 410 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs.
•occupancy costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•distribution costs decreased 10 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and higher capitalized balances resulting from increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•shrink costs increased 20 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•markdown costs increased 20 basis points resulting primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.
operating income margin for the dollar tree segment increased to 16.5% in 2022 from 11.5% in 2021 as a result of the gross profit margin increase noted above and a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. the selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 21.0% in 2022 compared to 21.5% in 2021 as a result of the net of the following:
•payroll expenses decreased 85 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase, partially offset by minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll.
•depreciation and amortization expense decreased 5 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase, partially offset by capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements.
•store facility costs increased 15 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates and higher utility costs, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25 basis points primarily due to unfavorable development of general liability claims, the benefit in the prior year associated with the realization of certain tax credits and inflationary pressure across several expense categories in the current year.

net sales for the family dollar segment increased $524.8 million, or 4.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to $385.8 million of new store sales and a comparable store net sales increase of 2.4%. average ticket increased 3.4% and customer traffic declined 1.0% in 2022. during the first quarter of 2022, approximately 400 stores serviced by the west memphis, arkansas distribution center were temporarily closed in connection with a retail-level product recall. the family dollar comparable store net sales increased 2.8% when excluding the effect of the store closures. net sales in the prior year were positively impacted by significant government stimulus dollars provided to our customers.
gross profit margin for the family dollar segment decreased to 24.4% in 2022 compared to 25.2% in 2021. the decrease is due to the net of the following:
•markdown costs increased 80 basis points primarily due to higher promotional and clearance markdowns.
•shrink costs increased 45 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•distribution costs were unchanged as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year as higher capitalized balances resulting from increases in inventory levels in the current year were offset by higher maintenance and compliance costs and higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 40 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise and higher freight costs.
operating income margin for the family dollar segment decreased to 1.0% in 2022 from 4.4% in 2021, resulting from the gross profit margin decrease noted above and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. the selling, general and administrative expense rate increased to 23.4% in 2022 from 20.9% in 2021 as a result of the following:
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 95 basis points primarily due to long-lived asset impairments related to certain stores and the west memphis, arkansas distribution center, higher legal fees and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.
•payroll expenses increased 85 basis points primarily due to minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll.
•store facility costs increased 60 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates, higher utility costs and costs associated with the removal of product from certain stores in connection with a voluntary retail-level product recall.
•depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 basis points primarily due to capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements.
liquidity and capital resources we invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, expand our distribution network and operate our existing stores. our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of september and october. historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $183.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of higher current year earnings, net of non-cash items, and smaller decreases in liability balances, partially offset by higher inventory levels and a smaller increase in accounts payable.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $233.9 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher capital expenditures in the current year.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased $149.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the following:
•in 2022, we paid $647.5 million in cash for stock repurchases compared to $950.0 million in the prior year.
•in 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2031 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty. in addition, in connection with the registering of these senior notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit, we paid $15.5 million in deferred financing costs.
at january 28, 2023, our long-term borrowings were $3.45 billion and we had $1.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $4.4 million. for additional detail on our long-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of funding requirements below, as well as note 4 and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
share repurchases we repurchased 4,613,696, 9,156,898 and 3,982,478 shares of common stock on the open market in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, for $647.5 million, $950.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively. at january 28, 2023, we had $1.85 billion remaining under our board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2023 to total approximately $690.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs. our total estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are approximately $2.0 billion, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, store renovations, supply chain and information technology investments, and other property improvements. we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
our material contractual obligations consist of long-term debt and related interest payments and operating lease obligations. additionally, we have commitments related to ocean shipping contracts, software license and support agreements, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores. other commitments include letters of credit for imported merchandise, standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and surety bonds that serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. for additional information regarding these obligations, including amounts outstanding at january 28, 2023, refer to note 4, note 5 and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "merchandise inventories," inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at january 28, 2023 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2022, including the fourth quarter. the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and, historically, these adjustments have not been material.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
self-insurance liabilities the liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers' compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. semiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
management's estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. we have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with the fiscal 2022 annual impairment evaluation, management's qualitative assessment did not indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. however, due to recent executive level management changes and investments being made with respect to the family dollar reporting unit, management elected to perform a quantitative assessment of both the family dollar goodwill and trade name.
we estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and adjusted for a control premium. under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management's judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. critical assumptions that are used as part of a quantitative family dollar goodwill evaluation include:
•the potential future revenue, ebitda and cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. the resulting revenue, ebitda and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. these operating plans include anticipated investments in associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased supply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing, and enhancements to our technology infrastructure. we believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2022 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 9.5% for our fiscal 2022 analysis.
our evaluation of goodwill did not result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount rate used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit.
our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.
for additional information related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets." for additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors" and elsewhere within this "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods. any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.

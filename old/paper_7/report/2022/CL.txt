item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business organization colgate-palmolive company (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," the "company" or "colgate") is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. we seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. we do this by developing and selling products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion ("de&i") strategies across our organization.
we are tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.
operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. we compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. approximately two-thirds of our net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with approximately 45% of our net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe, asia pacific and africa/eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and ecommerce retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and skin health professionals. through hill's pet nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and ecommerce retailers. we also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a gaap and non-gaap basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. in addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. the monitoring of these indicators and our code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. for additional information regarding non-gaap financial measures and the company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see "non-gaap financial measures" and "market share information" below.

covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19 have had and continue to have an impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop. during the covid-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and may in the future experience "stay at home" orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to address the pandemic. while the impact of covid-19 on our business has largely abated at this time, uncertainties continue, particularly in china where we have substantial manufacturing facilities and business, and in the travel retail channel, where we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions particularly in our filorga business. we have also experienced certain disruptions to our global supply chain due to covid-19, which have impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. in addition, we have witnessed changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers, including a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. covid-19 may continue to impact consumers' behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences.
while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above, uncertainty resulting from covid-19 could result in unforeseen additional disruptions to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.
for more information about the anticipated covid-19 impact, see "outlook" below.
the war in ukraine the war in ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in ukraine and russia, though it has not been material to our consolidated financial statements. the safety of our employees and partners in ukraine has been and remains our first priority. while our ability to do business in ukraine has been significantly impacted, we remain committed to rebuilding our business there and to providing access to essential products to people in the region. we have suspended the importation and sales of all products in russia other than essential health and hygiene products for everyday use and ceased all capital investments and media activities in russia. while these actions have impacted our eurasia business, they have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. in 2022, our eurasia business constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 3% of our consolidated operating profit (the majority of which was russia). we also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the war in ukraine. the situation is rapidly evolving and significant uncertainties remain regarding the full impact of the war and the related impact on the global economy and geopolitical relations generally, and on our business in particular. we have seen and expect to continue to see the war's impact on the global economy and our business including, among other things, the cost of raw and packaging materials and commodities (including the price of oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility. for more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to the war in ukraine, refer to part i, item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.

business strategy to achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments; expanding in faster-growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses. we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. we are strengthening and leveraging our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, ecommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. in particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. we continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers. we also continue to broaden our ecommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. we continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.
we are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. the retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.
the investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification.
significant items impacting comparability during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a non-cash charge of $721 pretax ($620 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets related to the filorga skin health business. the impairment was due primarily to the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga business, particularly in china, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels, and the impact of significantly higher interest rates. see note 5, goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
on september 30, 2022, the company acquired a business for a purchase price, as adjusted, of $719, which operates three dry pet food manufacturing plants in the united states, from red collar pet foods holdings, inc. and red collar pet foods holdings, l.p. (collectively, "red collar pet foods") to further support the global growth of the hill's pet nutrition business. see note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in july 2022, one of the company's subsidiaries in asia pacific completed the sale of land and recognized a pretax gain of $47 ($15 aftertax attributable to the company).
on january 27, 2022, the company's board of directors (the "board") approved a targeted productivity program (the "2022 global productivity initiative"). the program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax). annualized pretax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. for more information regarding the 2022 global productivity initiative, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
in the year ended december 31, 2022, we incurred pretax costs of $110 (aftertax costs of $87) resulting from the 2022 global productivity initiative.

in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the filorga skin health business. the impairment was due primarily to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. see note 5, goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
in 1990, our canadian subsidiary ("cp canada"), issued c$145 of canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due october 4, 2030 (the "canada notes"). in the third quarter of 2021, cp canada redeemed the canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in interest (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.
in 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in brazil. as a result of this favorable judgment, the company filed an application with the brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit. in may 2021, the brazilian supreme court issued a clarifying ruling allowing a higher deduction of state value-added tax when determining the taxable base. in light of this ruling, we recorded an additional benefit of $26 pretax ($20 aftertax) in the year ended december 31, 2021.

outlook looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates. during the year ended december 31, 2022, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. we also incurred increased logistics costs due to volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, higher ecommerce demand and the war in ukraine. we expect this difficult cost environment to continue in 2023. we are taking additional pricing to try to offset these increases in raw and packaging materials and logistics costs. this may, in turn, negatively impact consumer demand for our products. additionally, inflation is impacting the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as rising interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation. such inflation and rising interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to "private label" or lower-priced product offerings. although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. in light of this challenging environment, we expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.
given that approximately two-thirds of our net sales originate in markets outside the u.s., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. as discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material and logistics costs. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 global productivity initiative and our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, including additional pricing, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.
while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.
we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. in addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of ecommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. we plan to continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses. the substantial growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.
we continue to closely monitor the impact of the war in ukraine, covid-19 and the challenging market conditions discussed above on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. for more information about factors that could impact our business, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments, expanding in faster growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies. our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.

worldwide gross profit margin decreased to 57.0% in 2022 from 59.6% in 2021. this decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (810 bps), partially offset by higher pricing (360 bps) and cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps).

goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit due primarily to the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic, particularly in china, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit and the impact of significantly higher interest rates triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark, goodwill and long-lived assets which consists primarily of customer relationships. as a result of the interim impairment test, the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark and customer relationships exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded impairment charges of $300 and $89, respectively, reducing their carrying values to $257 and $118, respectively, as of december 31, 2022. after adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer relationship intangible assets, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $332 in the filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to $214 as of december 31, 2022.

(1) the income tax effect on non-gaap items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-gaap adjustment.
(2) the impact of non-gaap items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-gaap adjustment on income before income taxes and provision for income taxes.
the increase in the company's full year effective tax rate before discrete period items is primarily driven by the impact of recently finalized u.s. tax regulations, which place greater restrictions on foreign taxes that are creditable against u.s. taxes on foreign-sourced income.
the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company's global business initiatives.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was enacted, which among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations effective for years beginning after december 31, 2022. based on the company's preliminary analysis, the ira is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. the company will continue to evaluate the impact of this law as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.
additionally, on december 15, 2022, the 27 member states of the european union ("eu") reached an agreement on a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations to pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction in which they operate. this agreement, which is known as the minimum taxation directive, must be transposed into the laws of all eu member states by december 31, 2023. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this directive on the company's consolidated financial statements.
the company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. all u.s. federal income tax returns through december 31, 2013 have been audited by the internal revenue service (the "irs") and there are limited matters which the company plans to appeal for years 2010 through 2013. one such matter relates to the irs assessment of taxes on the company by imputing income on certain activities within one of our international operations. in light of a recent u.s. tax court ruling subsequent to december 31, 2022 in favor of the irs against an unrelated party on a similar
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
matter, the company is in the process of reassessing its position as it relates to this matter. the company is currently under audit by the irs, where the same matter is being discussed, for the years 2014 through 2018. the amount of tax plus interest for the years 2010 through 2018 is estimated to be approximately $145, which is not included in our uncertain tax positions. refer to note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's tax matters.

restructuring and related implementation charges on january 27, 2022, the board approved the 2022 global productivity initiative. the program is intended to reallocate resources towards the company's strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in the company's operations and streamline the company's supply chain to reduce structural costs.
implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax), which is currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. it is estimated that approximately 80% to 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. annualized pre-tax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented.
it is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in north america (5%), latin america (10%), europe (45%), asia pacific (5%), africa/eurasia (10%), hill's pet nutrition (10%) and corporate (15%).

non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k discusses certain financial measures on both a gaap and a non-gaap basis. the company uses the non-gaap financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company's underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.
net sales growth (gaap) and organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-gaap) are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k. management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is provided below.
selling, general and administrative expenses, other (income) expense, net, operating profit, operating profit margin, non-service related postretirement costs, interest (income) expense, net, effective income tax rate, net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company and earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k both on a gaap basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the 2022 global productivity initiative, goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, a gain on the sale of land in asia pacific, acquisition-related costs, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in brazil. these non-gaap financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the company's normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the company's business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-gaap basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends. these non-gaap financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. a reconciliation of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented within the applicable section of results of operations.

market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data (excluding venezuela from all periods).
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. in particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as ecommerce or certain discounters. the company measures year-to-date market shares from january 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. the company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.

liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations decreased to $2,556 in 2022 as compared to $3,325 in 2021, primarily due to changes in working capital and lower net income. the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was 1.0% in 2022 and (2.7)% in 2021. this change in working capital as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher inventory (driven by higher raw and packaging material costs and increased levels to mitigate the risk of supply chain and logistics disruptions), higher accounts receivable, and lower accounts payable and accruals. the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt).
investing activities used $1,601 of cash in 2022 compared to $592 during 2021. investing activities in 2022 included the company's acquisition of businesses from red collar pet foods and nutriamo discussed in note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.

financing activities used $952 of cash during 2022 compared to $2,774 during 2021. the decrease in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the proceeds from debt issuances in 2022 to fund acquisitions as compared to 2021.
long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $8,755 as of december 31, 2022, as compared to $7,206 as of december 31, 2021, and total debt increased to $8,766 as of december 31, 2022 as compared to $7,245 as of december 31, 2021. the company's debt issuances and redemptions support the company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.
during the third quarter of 2022, the company issued $500 of three-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100%, $500 of five-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100% and $500 of ten-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.250%. the debt issuances were under the company's shelf registration statement.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company issued €500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the "sustainability bond"). the debt issuance was under the company's shelf registration statement. an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sustainability bond was allocated to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the company's sustainable financing framework during the period from january 1, 2020 through july 31, 2022.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of €500, originally issued on november 12, 2019. the redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. the redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.
in 1990, the company's canadian subsidiary ("cp canada"), issued c$145 of canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due october 4, 2030 (the "canada notes"). during the third quarter of 2021, cp canada redeemed the canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in interest (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.

long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2023. the company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its u.s. postretirement plans in 2023. in addition, total benefit payments expected to be paid from the company's assets to participants in unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately $86 for the year ending december 31, 2023.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see "results of operations" above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
the company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $4 and $12 at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. at the end of 2022, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $80.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
based on year-end 2022 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2022.
the company has completed its assessment of the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and concluded it to be not material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements. the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $1 and $2 at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. at the end of 2022, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.
recent accounting pronouncements in september 2022, the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2022-04, "liabilities-supplier finance programs (subtopic 405-50): disclosure of supplier finance program obligations." this asu requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. the guidance, which is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2023 (except for the roll-forward, which is effective beginning on january 1, 2024), is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in march 2022, the fasb issued asu no. 2022-02, "financial instruments-credit losses (topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures." this asu eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. the amendments also require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in march 2022, the fasb issued asu no. 2022-01, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): fair value hedging-portfolio layer method." this asu clarifies the accounting and promotes consistency in reporting for hedges where the portfolio layer method is applied. this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2023 and is not expected to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

in november 2021, the fasb issued asu no. 2021-10, "government assistance (topic 832)." this asu requires increased disclosure on an annual basis about transactions with domestic, foreign, local, regional and national governments, including entities related to those governments and intergovernmental organizations, that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. this guidance was effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2022 and did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in october 2021, the fasb issued asu no. 2021-08, "business combinations (topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers." this asu requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asu no. 2016-10, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)." this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in march 2020, the fasb issued asu no. 2020-04, "reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting," which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. in january 2021, the fasb issued asu no. 2021-01, "reference rate reform (topic 848): scope," which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in topic 848 apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. in december 2022, the fasb issued asu no. 2022-06, "reference rate reform (topic 848): deferral of the sunset date of topic 848," which defers the sunset date of topic 848 from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief under topic 848. we have completed our evaluation of significant contracts under this asu. certain of the reviewed contracts have been modified and the remaining reviewed contracts will be modified, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, primarily the secured overnight financing rate (sofr). accordingly the guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.
▪the company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method (20% of inventories). there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2022 or 2021 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method.
▪shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales, the company's gross profit margin would have been lower by 1,040 bps in 2022, by 970 bps in 2021, and 850 bps in 2020, with no impact on reported earnings.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.
▪in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 5.66% and 2.98% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 5.67% and 3.06% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 6.25% as of december 31, 2022 and 5.70% as of december 31, 2021. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were (18)%, 1%, 4%, 4% and 5%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 3% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $13. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and u.s. other retiree benefit plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $2 and $1, respectively. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 6.25% for 2023, declining to 4.50% by 2027 and remaining at 4.50% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $2.
▪the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2022 was $14.71. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 6%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. the company uses a monte-carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. the monte-carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the black-scholes model.
▪goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. in assessing impairment, the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
determining the fair value of the company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. when a quantitative analysis is performed, the company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. in selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the company considers the long-term profitability of the brand and recent market transactions for similar brands and products. in determining an appropriate discount rate, the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. other qualitative factors the company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. the company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. as multiple valuation methodologies are used, the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.
determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold.
in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit due primarily to the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic, particularly in china, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit and the impact of significantly higher interest rates triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark, goodwill and long-lived assets which consists primarily of customer relationships. as a result of the interim impairment test, the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark and customer relationships exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded impairment charges of $300 and $89, respectively, reducing their carrying values to $257 and $118, respectively, as of december 31, 2022. after adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer relationship intangible assets, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $332 in the filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to $214 as of december 31, 2022.
except for the filorga skin health business described above, the estimated fair value of the company's remaining reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value.
as of the date of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value of two of the company's indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets, other than filorga, exceeded their recorded carrying values by less than 10%. the combined carrying value for these trademarks is $465 as of december 31, 2022. either a reduction in the royalty rate of 50 basis points, a reduction in the long term sales growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in discount rate of 50 bps would result in the fair value of each of these indefinite-lived trademarks approximating their respective carrying value.
given the inherent uncertainties of estimating the future impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, interest rates and inflation on macroeconomic conditions, actual results may differ from management's current estimates which could potentially result in additional impairment charges in future periods.

in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit due primarily to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company performed an impairment review and concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. after adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.
▪the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.
▪legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.

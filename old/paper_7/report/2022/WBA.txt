introduction and segments walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries ("walgreens boots alliance" or the "company") is a global leader in retail pharmacy and is positioning itself to become a leading provider of healthcare services. its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:
•u.s. retail pharmacy,
•international, and
•u.s. healthcare.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the company's business activities, structure and strategy. the "united states" segment was renamed to "u.s. retail pharmacy" and the "walgreens health" segment was renamed to "u.s. healthcare". the segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. the information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names. see note 17. segment reporting and note 18. sales, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further information.
factors, trends and uncertainties affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. these factors include: the impact of covid-19 ("covid-19") on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including amerisourcebergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including u.s. tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the u.s. and china, and international relations, including the uk's withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates.
specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the u.s., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. to better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in march 2017, the company and prime therapeutics llc, a pbm, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy, pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. on december 31, 2021, the company purchased prime's portion of the joint venture and now wholly own the joint venture, which was renamed alliancerx walgreens. certain clients of alliancerx walgreens are not obligated to contract through alliancerx walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving alliancerx walgreens. certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through alliancerx walgreens which impacts gross sales. however, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, the company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income.
in january 2022, the company announced a strategic review of its boots business, including the no7 beauty company. in june 2022, the company announced the conclusion of the strategic review and decision to retain existing ownership in these businesses.
wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k on may 5, 2022, the company entered into an agreement with the state of florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the company's pharmacies in the state of florida. the settlement amount of $683 million includes $620 million to be paid in equal installments to the state of florida over 18 years and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys' fees. the company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on june 17, 2022.
these and other factors can affect the company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
covid-19
since the beginning of 2020, covid-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to directly and indirectly impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic and supply chain disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected our industries and our business operations. further, financial and credit markets experienced volatility and could continue to experience volatility due to covid-19 and other factors. as covid-19 and its direct and indirect consequences continue to evolve, covid-19 has impacted, and may again impact our business operations. in response to covid-19 and emerging variants, various domestic and foreign, federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives were implemented that were designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid-19. the company has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the u.s., and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk, and if available, may continue to do so in the future.
the company continues to play a critical role in fighting covid-19. the company has worked with the centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc"), u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs") and the u.s. government to help administer covid-19 vaccinations to the general public and to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. the u.s. retail pharmacy segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access, including same-day and walk-in appointments, mobile clinics, employer partnerships and extended hours. as of august 31, 2022, the company has administered more than 69 million covid-19 vaccinations, including 23 million booster vaccinations, and more than 45 million covid-19 tests in the u.s. in fiscal 2022, the company has administered approximately 35 million covid-19 vaccinations and more than 31 million covid-19 tests in the u.s.
in fiscal 2022, the u.s. retail pharmacy segment comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled increased 1.3%, including a positive impact of 12 basis points from covid-19 vaccinations. comparable retail sales increase was aided by at-home covid-19 test sales.
the company continues to monitor covid-19 and its potential future impacts on the consumer, customer and healthcare utilization patterns, as well as the u.s. and global economies, including supply chains and the labor force. as a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.
the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and in item 1a, risk factors.

the transformational cost management program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company's information technology (it) capabilities, is designed to help the company achieve increased cost efficiencies. to date, the company has taken actions across all aspects of the transformational cost management program which focus on the u.s. retail pharmacy and international reportable segments along with the company's global functions. divisional optimization within the company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores, including plans to close approximately 350 stores in the uk and approximately 450 to 500 stores in the u.s. as of august 31, 2022, the company has closed 235 and 287 stores in the uk and u.s., respectively.

wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k walgreens boots alliance results of operations the following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. for discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2021 form 10-k, as amended by form 10-k/a which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on november 24, 2021.
net earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
fiscal 2022 net earnings attributable to the company were $4.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period. diluted net earnings per share were $5.01 compared to $2.30 for the prior year period. the increases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect a $2.5 billion after-tax gain during the three months ended november 30, 2021 due to the remeasurement of the company's previously held minority equity and debt investments in villagemd and shields to fair value, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, from the company's equity earnings in amerisourcebergen in the prior fiscal year offset by the fiscal 2022 impairment charges related to intangible assets in boots uk, and the charge related to the opioid settlement with the state of florida in fiscal 2022.
other income, net in fiscal 2022 was $3.0 billion compared to $558 million in fiscal 2021. the increase in other income is mainly due to the remeasurement of the company's previously held equity and debt investments in villagemd and shields to fair value, and the partial sale of the company's equity method investments in amerisourcebergen and option care health.
net interest expense was $400 million and $905 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of early debt extinguishments completed during fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates on remaining debt.
the company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 0.8% benefit and 33.4%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pre-tax gains from the consolidation of the company's investments in villagemd and shields, for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax. additionally, the company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. the reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in amerisourcebergen and option care, capital gains recognized from internal restructuring, and based on forecasted capital gains. see note 3. acquisitions and other investments and note 6. equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii, item 8 for further information.
adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021
adjusted net earnings attributable to the company in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $4.4 billion compared with the prior year period. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $5.04 compared with the year-ago period. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.9 percentage points as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2022 primarily reflects improved retail contributions in the u.s. retail pharmacy and a continued rebound in international segment sales and profitability, partly offset by a decrease in u.s. pharmacy operating results, and growth investments in u.s. healthcare. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and related disclosures.

the company does not provide a reconciliation for non-gaap estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking gaap financial measure. for the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. forward-looking non-gaap financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding gaap financial measures.

adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in amerisourcebergen consist of the company's proportionate share of non-gaap adjustments reported by amerisourcebergen consistent with the company's non-gaap measures. the company recognized equity losses in amerisourcebergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended november 30, 2020. these equity losses are primarily due to amerisourcebergen's recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended september 30, 2020.
acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-gaap measure represents the entire amount recorded within the company's gaap financial statements. the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-gaap measures. amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. these charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. the fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. the acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments exclude the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. the stock based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-gaap measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.
transformational cost management program and store optimization program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. these charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. these costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.

certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. in fiscal 2022, the company recorded a $683 million charge related to a settlement agreement with the state of florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the company's pharmacies in the state of florida. the company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the company's operating performance. these charges are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. these costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. these charges are primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. these costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the company's current operating performance.
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets do not relate to the ordinary course of the company's business. the company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the company's operating performance. these charges are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
the company's u.s. retail pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out ("lifo") method. this adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the u.s. retail pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out ("fifo") method. the lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. therefore, the company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items.
store damage and inventory losses as a result of looting in the u.s., net of insurance recoveries.

wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, legal contingencies and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
leases - the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. the lease classification is determined at the commencement date. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. lease commencement is the date the company has the right to control the property. the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is based on the company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the company's economic and strategic initiatives. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.
the company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. these are expensed as incurred. the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.
finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.
wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the company's reporting units. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of covid-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability.
the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
impairment of long lived assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. long-lived assets related to the company's retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. if the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.
the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
cost of sales and inventory -
retail, pharmacy and wholesale cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.
the company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, distribution of products, and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.the company's u.s. retail pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out ("lifo") method. the company's international segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out ("fifo") method.
wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors' products. allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. allowances received for promoting vendors' products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. rebates or refunds received by the company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier's products purchased by the company.
healthcare services for operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization. medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients. cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits. clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.
the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and post-retirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
in determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $213 million to the company's pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company's pension expense by $16 million.
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.
wba fiscal 2022 form 10-k contingencies - the company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. with respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. the company's assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the company to change those estimates and assumptions. therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. management's assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the company which are not presently known. adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management's assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.

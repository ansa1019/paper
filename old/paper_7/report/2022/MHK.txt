during the past two decades, the company has grown significantly. its current geographic breadth and diverse product offering are reflected in three reporting segments: global ceramic, flooring na and flooring row. global ceramic designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone tile and other products including natural stone, porcelain slabs and quartz countertops, which it distributes primarily in north america, europe, brazil and russia through various selling channels, which include company-owned stores, independent distributors and home centers. flooring na designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering products, including broadloom carpet, carpet tile, carpet cushion, rugs, laminate, vinyl products, including luxury vinyl tile ("lvt") and sheet vinyl, and wood flooring, all of which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. the segment's product lines are sold through various channels, including independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, online retailers, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. flooring row designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, vinyl products, including lvt and sheet vinyl, wood flooring, roofing panels, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard ("mdf") and chipboards, which it distributes primarily in europe, russia, australia and new zealand through various channels, including independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, company-owned distributors, home centers, commercial contractors and commercial end users.
mohawk is a significant supplier of every major flooring category with manufacturing operations in 19 nations and sales in approximately 170 countries. based on its annual sales, the company believes it is the world's largest flooring manufacturer. a majority of the company's long-lived assets are located in the united states and europe, which are also the company's primary markets. additionally, the company maintains operations in australia, brazil, malaysia, mexico, new zealand, russia and other parts of the world. the company is a leading provider of flooring for residential and commercial markets and has earned significant recognition for its innovation in design and performance as well as sustainability.
due to its global footprint, mohawk's business is sensitive to macroeconomic events in the united states and abroad, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. while the near-term economic and financial impact of the covid-19 pandemic is unpredictable, the company may continue to see fluctuating demand across a number of its markets. in addition, as a result of russian military actions in ukraine, the company experienced supply chain disruption of raw materials sourced from ukraine (primarily clay), as well as other materials and spare parts needed in the company's operations. the company was also impacted by global increases in the cost of natural gas, oil and oil-based raw materials and chemicals that were among the broader consequences of russia's actions. in addition, the united states, the european union and other governments have imposed and extended sanctions on russia as well as on certain individuals and financial institutions and have proposed the use of broader economic sanctions. russia also imposed reciprocal sanctions against the united states and european union. since first quarter 2022, the company has suspended new investments in russia. the broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further economic sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory actions, including nationalization of foreign-owned businesses; increased tensions between the united states and countries in which the company operates; and the extent of the conflict's effect on the company's business and results of operations, as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.
index to financial statements during the past year, rapid cost escalations in materials, energy, transportation and labor have impacted the company's profitability across all segments. during 2022, inflation, rising interest rates and other macroeconomic factors impacted new single-family home construction and residential remodeling in most of the company's major markets. as consumers faced a higher cost of living, discretionary spending - including flooring purchases - declined; and, as a result, the company's flooring customers reduced inventories, with the greatest impact falling in the fourth quarter. mohawk has, to some extent, offset the impact of inflationary pressures through multiple pricing actions across product categories and geographies; improved mix from sales of higher-value, differentiated products; productivity gains in manufacturing and logistics and cost containment measures. given the volatility of energy prices in some geographies and material prices in some product categories, these external pressures may change significantly and unpredictably, which could have an adverse impact on the company's results. similarly, inflationary pressures around the globe may impact consumer and commercial investments in flooring and other large, deferrable purchases. during 2022, the company took actions to enhance future performance including facility and product rationalizations and workforce reductions. the company anticipates these global actions will deliver annual savings of approximately $55 to $60 million, with an estimated cost of approximately $125 to $130 million.
the company believes it is well positioned with a strong balance sheet and limited debt. based on its current liquidity and available credit, the company is in a position to finance internal investments, acquisitions and/or additional stock purchases. for information on risk that could impact the company's results, please refer to risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
since becoming a publicly traded company in april 1992, mohawk has grown both organically and through strategic and bolt-on acquisitions. mohawk has completed a number of smaller acquisitions in recent years, many of which expanded the company's hard surface flooring distribution in europe. in 2021, the company purchased an irish insulation manufacturer that complemented its existing insulation production and distribution in ireland and the u.k. and a french mdf production plant that added additional capacity and product offerings. during 2022, the company completed five small, bolt-on acquisitions: a wood veneer plant in romania; a sheet vinyl producer in poland; a mezzanine flooring manufacturer in germany; a nonwoven carpet and rug producer in the u.s.; and a commercial flooring trim and accessories business in the u.s.
on june 3, 2022, the company entered into an agreement to purchase the vitromex ceramic tile business from grupo industrial saltillo for approximately $293 million in cash. the vitromex business includes four manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout mexico. the transaction has received regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions.
on november 4, 2022, the company entered into an agreement to purchase elizabeth revestimentos, a brazilian ceramic tile business, for approximately $217 million in cash. the elizabeth business includes four manufacturing facilities strategically located throughout brazil. the transaction closed on february 2, 2023. the company believes that the combination of the eliane and elizabeth businesses should create the leading market position in brazil and yield significant sales and operational synergies.
in 2022, the company invested $580.7 million in capital projects for capacity expansions, cost reduction initiatives and upgrades for recent acquisitions as well as maintenance across the segments. the largest investments during this period were in the company's lvt portfolio to upgrade its product offering and improve profitability; premium water-proof laminate expansion in north america and europe; quartz countertop expansion in north america; and porcelain slab expansion in europe. in 2023, the company plans to invest an additional amount of approximately $560 million to complete existing projects and commence new initiatives. the primary areas of investment are expected to be similar to those in 2022.
net earnings attributable to the company were $25.2 million for 2022 compared to $1,033.2 million for 2021. the change in net earnings was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs; the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charge; lower sales volume; the unfavorable impact of temporary plant shutdowns; higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs; charges related to legal settlements, reserves and fees, net of insurance proceeds; the unfavorable net impact from of foreign exchange rates and higher costs associated with investments in new product development and marketing costs. the unfavorable impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix; productivity gains and lower taxes due to decreased earnings in 2022 compared to the prior year. the company believes that a number of circumstances may impact trends in 2023, including impacts to material availability due to disruptions in the global supply chain and inflation, but the extent and duration of such impact cannot be predicted.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company generated $669.2 million of cash from operating activities. as of december 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $509.6 million, of which $299.3 million was in the united states and $210.4 million was in foreign countries, in addition to $158.0 million in short-term investments.

flooring na-operating income was $231.1 million (5.5% of segment net sales) for 2022 reflecting a decrease of $176.5 million, or 43.3%, compared to operating income of $407.6 million (9.9% of segment net sales) for 2021. the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $449 million; lower sales volume of approximately $110 million; the unfavorable impact of temporary plant shutdowns of approximately $57 million; higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs of approximately $33 million and the indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charge of approximately $1 million, partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $398 million and productivity gains of approximately $81 million.
flooring row-operating income was $340.2 million (10.6% of segment net sales) for 2022 reflecting a decrease of $230.9 million, or 40.4%, compared to operating income of $571.1 million (18.0% of segment net sales) for 2021. the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs of approximately $504 million; the unfavorable impact of temporary plant shutdowns of approximately $61 million; lower sales volume of approximately $60 million; decreased productivity of approximately $33 million; higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs of approximately $30 million; the unfavorable net impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $14 million and the indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charge of approximately $6 million, partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $473 million.
interest expense interest expense was $51.9 million for 2022, reflecting a decrease of $5.4 million compared to interest expense of $57.3 million for 2021. the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the redemption of the $600 million 3.85% senior notes on november 1, 2022, the redemption of the €500.0 million 2.00% senior notes in october 2021 and miscellaneous interest income, partially offset by the increase in commercial paper borrowings and the utilization of the term loan facility in the fourth quarter of 2022.
index to financial statements other expense (income)
other expense was $8.4 million for 2022, reflecting an unfavorable change of $20.6 million compared to other income of $12.2 million for 2021. the change was primarily driven by the resolution of foreign non-income tax contingencies of approximately $6 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, the unfavorable net impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $9 million and the release of an indemnification receivable related to the reversal of uncertain tax positions recorded with the emil acquisition of approximately $7 million, partially offset by other miscellaneous items of approximately $2 million.
income tax expense for 2022, the company recorded income tax expense of $158.1 million on earnings before income taxes of $183.9 million for an effective tax rate of 86.0%, as compared to an income tax expense of $256.4 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,290.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.9% for 2021. in 2022, the lower income before taxes and the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge contributed to the higher tax rate. in 2021, the company also recognized a one-time italian step-up benefit allowing for the realignment of tax asset values and a benefit from a tax rate differential on a u.s. loss carryback.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. the company's capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, commercial paper, bank credit lines, term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers. as of december 31, 2022, the company had a total of $1,101.6 million available under its senior credit facility. the company also maintains local currency revolving lines of credit and other credit facilities to provide liquidity to its businesses around the world.  none of such local facilities are material in amount.
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2022 was $669.2 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1,309.1 million for the year ended 2021. this decrease of $640.0 million was primarily attributable to decreases in accounts payable and net earnings, partially offset by higher accounts receivable.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2022 was $625.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $556.8 million for the year ended 2021. the increase was primarily due to the increase in acquisitions of $85.6 million and a decrease in the redemptions of short-term investments of $78.3 million (net of purchases of short-term investments), partially offset by the decrease of capital expenditures of $95.4 million.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2022 was $194.3 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,232.2 million for the year ended 2021. the change in cash is primarily attributable to proceeds from the term loan facility of $908.0 million, lower share repurchases of $592.8 million and lower payments on the senior notes of $332.3 million, partially offset by the decrease in net borrowings on commercial paper of $394.4 million.
on february 10, 2022, the company's board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, the company purchased $307.6 million of its common stock, exhausting the $36.8 million remaining under the prior share repurchase program authorized on september 16, 2021 (the "2021 share repurchase program"), and utilizing $270.8 million under the 2022 share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2022, there remained $229.2 million authorized under the 2022 share repurchase program.
as of december 31, 2022, the company had cash of $509.6 million, of which $210.4 million was held outside the united states. in addition to its cash on hand, the company also had short-term investments of $158.0 million as of december 31, 2022. the company plans to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the united states. the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet its planned capital expenditures, working capital investments and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.
see note 10, long-term debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion of the company's long-term debt. the company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amount involved may be material.

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. in reaching such decisions, the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
index to financial statements the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.
•acquisition accounting. the fair value of the consideration the company pays for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill.  the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models.  projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. the impact of prior or future acquisitions on the company's financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. see note 2, acquisitions included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.
•goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, which for the company are its tradenames, are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. the company's annual impairment tests of goodwill and tradenames may be completed through qualitative assessments. the company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test, for any reporting unit or tradename, in any period. the company can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit or tradename in any subsequent period.
the company has identified global ceramic, flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill as well as assessing impairments. the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment.
under a qualitative approach, the company's impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. if the company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting units, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test that requires it to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.
the quantitative goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows under the income approach classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and comparable company market valuation classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy approaches. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the company will measure any goodwill impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, wacc, and comparable company market multiples. when developing these key judgments and assumptions, the company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. however, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectations regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.
under a qualitative approach, the company's impairment review for tradenames consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tradename's fair value is less than its carrying value. if the company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment for any tradename, or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a tradename exceeds its fair value, the company performs a quantitative tradename impairment test of the tradename.
index to financial statements the quantitative impairment test for tradenames involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the tradename to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the tradename exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the tradenames. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, discount rates and the amount of expected future cash flows. the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the tradenames. estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.
as a result of a decrease in the company's market capitalization, comparable company market multiples, projected future cash flows and an increase in the wacc due to increases in the risk free rate and applicable risk premiums, the company determined that a triggering event occurred requiring goodwill impairment testing for each of its reporting units as of october 1, 2022. the impairment test indicated a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the global ceramic reporting unit of $688,514 ($679,664 net of tax) which the company recorded during the third quarter of 2022. the company concluded goodwill of its other reporting units was not impaired on october 1, 2022. in addition, the company compared the estimated fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles to their carrying values and determined that there were impairments of $7,257 ($5,939 net of tax) in the flooring row and flooring na reporting units during the third quarter of 2022.
the excess of fair value over carrying value for the flooring row reporting unit was approximately 20% and the excess of fair value over carrying value for the flooring na reporting unit was less than 5% as of october 1, 2022. the company's annual testing date for goodwill and tradenames is the first day of its fourth quarter and due to the fact that there were no significant changes in facts or circumstances in the one calendar day, the company determined there was no additional impairment of goodwill or tradenames. the company conducted a qualitative analysis as of december 31, 2022 and determined there was no indication of an impairment.
a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions, continued increases in the costs of raw materials and energy combined with an inability to pass these costs on to customers, a further decline in the company's market capitalization or comparable company market multiples, a reduction in projected future cash flows, or increases in the wacc, could impact the company's assumptions and require a reassessment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in future periods.
•long-lived assets. the company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. if such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.
•income taxes. the company's effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating the company's tax positions. deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. for further information regarding the company's valuation allowances, see note 15, income taxes, included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
index to financial statements in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 740-10. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. for further information regarding the company's uncertain tax positions, see note 15, income taxes, included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the company's accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our financial statements and disclosures.
impact of inflation inflation affects the company's manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. the company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum-based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company's production processes. although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the company's ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the company's products. there have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. in the past, the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.
seasonality the company is a calendar year-end company. global ceramic and the flooring na typically have higher net sales in the second and third quarters. flooring row typically has higher net sales in the second and fourth quarters. because periods of economic downturn can affect the seasonality of each segment, sales for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full year.

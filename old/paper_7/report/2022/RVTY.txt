overview of fiscal year 2022
during fiscal year 2022, we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology, marketing and people. our overall revenue in fiscal year 2022 decreased by $516.0 million, or 13%, as compared to fiscal year 2021, reflecting a decrease of $913.0 million, or 31%, in our diagnostics segment revenue, partially offset by an increase of $395.2 million, or 44%, in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $366.9 million to our overall revenue during fiscal year 2022. the decrease in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by decreased demand for our covid-19 product offerings, partially offset by an increase in our core product offerings resulting in a decrease of $689.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue and a decrease of $225.8 million in our applied genomics revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $58.1 million to our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022. the increase in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2022 was driven by an increase of $395.2 million in our life sciences market revenue. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $308.7 million to the increase in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2022.
in our diagnostics segment, we experienced a global decline in demand for our covid-19 product offerings due to the cancellation of our service contracts for the state of california and the united kingdom, and lower covid-19 testing volumes compared to fiscal year 2021. we saw strong growth in our core immunodiagnostics business in the americas and europe, partially offset by the impact of extensive shutdowns in china. in our reproductive health business, an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach more than offset the impact of declining birthrates.
in our discovery & analytical solutions segment, the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets across all regions. instruments, reagents and software experienced strong growth and we saw a positive impact from pricing actions we took in early 2022.
our consolidated gross margins decreased 350 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to increased amortization of acquired intangible assets and lower revenue from our covid-19 product offerings, partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix and service productivity. our consolidated operating margin decreased 1,045 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to lower revenue from our covid-19 product offerings, increased costs related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, and investments in new product development and growth initiatives. during fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions and inflation did not materially impact our results of operations as compared to fiscal year 2021 as the effects of our initiatives to reduce transportation costs more than offset the impact of inflation on our raw materials purchases. during fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions and inflation increased our cost of goods sold by less than $10.0 million as compared to fiscal year 2021.
overall, we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations, coupled with our expanded range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth, strong margins and cash flows, and long-term earnings per share growth.
consolidated results of operations fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021
revenue revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $3.3 billion, as compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 13%, which includes an approximate 4% decrease in revenue attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an approximate 9% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions. revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $366.9 million to our overall revenue during fiscal year 2022. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. the decrease in total revenue reflects a decrease in our diagnostics segment revenue of $913.0 million, or 31%, due to decreased demand for our covid-19 product offerings, partially offset by an increase in our core product offerings resulting in a decrease of $689.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue and a decrease of $225.8 million in our applied genomics revenue. our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue increased by $395.2 million, or 44%, due to increase in revenue in our life sciences market, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million and $2.6 million of revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $1.3 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of approximately $71.8 million, or 5%. as a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 40% in fiscal year 2022 from 36% in fiscal year 2021, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 350 basis points to 60% in fiscal year 2022 from 64% in fiscal year 2021. amortization of intangible assets increased to $141.6 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $100.7 million for fiscal year 2021. amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $88.5 million for fiscal year 2022. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $45.3 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $35.2 million for fiscal year 2021. other purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $6.2 million for fiscal year 2022, of which $5.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation and $0.6 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment. the overall decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix, pricing actions and service productivity.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $1,025.5 million, as compared to $975.2 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of approximately $50.3 million, or 5%. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 31% in fiscal year 2022 from 25% in fiscal year 2021. amortization of intangible assets increased to $229.1 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $155.9 million for fiscal year 2021. amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $135.3 million for fiscal year 2022. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses added an incremental expense of $28.9 million for fiscal year 2022, of which $15.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation, as compared to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses increasing expenses by $59.7 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.9 million was acquisition-related stock compensation. purchase accounting adjustments decreased expenses by $1.2 million for fiscal year 2022, resulting from a $1.4 million change in contingent consideration, partially offset by $0.2 million in increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments increasing expenses by $2.9 million for fiscal year 2021, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration. asset impairment costs added an incremental expense of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021. legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements, net of reversals, decreased expenses by $0.6 million for fiscal year 2022. in addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to investments in people, digital capabilities, innovation, and recent acquisitions.
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $221.6 million, as compared to $200.3 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of $21.3 million, or 11%. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses increased to 7% in fiscal year 2022 from 5% in fiscal year 2021. stock compensation related to our acquisitions added an incremental expense of $5.4 million in fiscal year 2022, as compared to $1.4 million for fiscal year 2021. purchase accounting adjustments for depreciation on property, plant and equipment added an incremental expense of $0.2 million in fiscal year 2022, as compared to $0.1 million for fiscal year 2021. excluding the factors above, the net increase in research and development expenses was due to timing of investments in new non-covid-19 product development, partially offset by a decrease in covid-19 related research and development expenses.

the increase of $36.0 million in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was largely due to a change in fair value of financial securities of $15.8 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to $(11.0) million in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $1.8 million in interest expense and $4.5 million in other expense, net in fiscal year 2022 and a lower net pension credit of $33.2 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to $37.4 million in fiscal year 2021. a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 21.3% and 26.1% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under statutory tax rates. a reconciliation of income tax expense at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

the variation in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 is primarily affected by the accrual of $20.5 million related to a change in tax status of a certain foreign subsidiary. during fiscal year 2021, we also recognized $37.1 million in u.s. federal, u.s. state and non-u.s. taxes related to foreign earnings that we no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. during fiscal year 2022, we adjusted these estimates and recognized a net benefit of $4.9 million relative to our position to permanently reinvest those foreign earnings. we also recognized $1.1 million of benefit in fiscal year 2022 derived from the tax holiday in singapore. we recognized $18.2 million in fiscal year 2021 of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore. the effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2022 was $0.01 and $0.01, respectively, and for fiscal year 2021 was $0.16 and $0.16, respectively. the tax holiday in china is renewed every three years. we expect to renew the tax holiday for one of our subsidiaries in china that is set to expire in fiscal year 2023.
fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020
revenue revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $3.8 billion, as compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 44%, which includes an approximate 11% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions, and a 1% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. the total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our diagnostics segment revenue of $865.0 million, or 42%, due to increased demand for our covid-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $748.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue. our diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $58.0 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $59.0 million in our applied genomics revenue. our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue increased by $301.1 million, or 50%, due to an increase in revenue in our life sciences market, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $2.6 million and $1.1 million of revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

discontinued operations in august 2022, we entered into a master purchase and sale agreement (the "purchase agreement") with polaris purchaser, l.p. (the "purchaser"), a delaware limited partnership owned by funds managed by affiliates of new mountain capital l.l.c. (the "sponsor"), under which we agreed to sell to the purchaser certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting our analytical, food and enterprise services businesses (the "business") (as further defined in the purchase agreement), for cash consideration of up to approximately $2.45 billion and the purchaser's assumption of certain liabilities relating to the business (collectively, the "transaction"). approximately $2.30 billion of the purchase price will be payable at closing, subject to certain customary adjustments, which includes $75.0 million in deferred payments tied to the transfer of the perkinelmer brand and related trademarks to the purchaser (which may be completed within 24 months following the date of the closing at our election). the purchase agreement also provides for potential post-closing payments totaling up to $150.0 million, which are contingent on the exit valuation the sponsor and its affiliated funds receive on a sale or other capital events related to the business. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
the business had been recorded in the discovery & analytical solutions segment. the sale of the business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. accordingly, we have classified the assets and liabilities related to the business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. financial information in this report relating to the fiscal years ended january 2, 2022 and january 3, 2021 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this discontinued operation.
the summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations, were as follows:
january 1, 2023                  january 2, 2022                  january 3, 2021

income from discontinued operations before income taxes              $73,604                          $76,304                         $106,292
during fiscal year 2022, we recognized $69.4 million of divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $7.5 million during fiscal year 2021, an increase of $61.9 million. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by decreased amortization expense and acquisition-related costs. during fiscal year 2022, we recognized $8.2 million of amortization expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $19.3 million during fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $11.1 million, as we suspended the amortization of the intangible assets related to the business during fiscal year 2022 when it was reclassified into discontinued operations. during fiscal year 2022, we recognized $6.4 million of incentive award associated with one of the company's acquisitions in discontinued operations, as compared to $14.3 million during fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $7.8 million.
during fiscal year 2021, divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations increased by $7.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2020. in addition, payroll and employee benefits and acquisition-related costs pertaining to an incentive award associated with one of the company's acquisitions increased by $20.4 million and $9.6 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal year 2020.
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets. we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. however, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. the proposed sale of the business classified as discontinued operations is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which we expect will generate approximately $2.2 billion of proceeds to us. we expect to use these proceeds for funding upcoming debt maturities, opportunistic share repurchases and continued strategic and value-creating acquisitions.
we and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:
•changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and
•changes in our working capital requirements.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,
•increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,
•a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,
•increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,
•a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and
•volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

dividends our board of directors (our "board") declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. at january 1, 2023, we had accrued $8.8 million for a dividend declared in october 2022 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that was paid in february 2023. on january 26, 2023, we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 that will be payable in may 2023. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.
capital expenditures during fiscal year 2023, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2022, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.
other potential liquidity considerations at january 1, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $454.4 million, of which $385.4 million was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, and we had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we had no other liquid investments at january 1, 2023.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. we use our non-u.s. cash for needs outside of the united states including foreign operations, capital investments, acquisitions and repayment of debt. in addition, we transfer cash to the united states using nontaxable returns of capital, distributions of previously taxed income, as well as dividends, where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently. we have accrued tax expense on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as required by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act") and where the foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested. in accordance with the tax act, we are making scheduled annual cash payments on our accrued transition tax.
as of january 1, 2023, we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $879.0 million in earnings that we do not consider to be permanently reinvested. we have recorded a provision of approximately $15.8 million for taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. we began repatriating foreign earnings to the united states in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and expect to continue the repatriation in fiscal year 2023. there are no other undistributed foreign earnings and outside basis differences for which we have not provided for any taxes as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested, and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability that would be incurred.
on july 31, 2020, our board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the "repurchase program"). on july 22, 2022, the repurchase program was terminated by our board and the board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $300.0 million under a new stock repurchase program (the "new repurchase program"). no shares remain available for repurchase under the repurchase program due to its termination. the new repurchase program will expire on july 22, 2024 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 240,000 shares of common stock under the repurchase program for an aggregate cost of $43.4 million. during fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 138,025 shares of common stock under the new repurchase program for an aggregate cost of $19.1 million. as of january 1, 2023, $280.9 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the new repurchase program.
in addition, our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. during fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 115,247 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $18.1 million. during fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 71,248 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $10.5 million.
the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. if we continue to repurchase shares, the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
as of january 1, 2023, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $106.2 million. as of january 1, 2023, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $46.6 million, of which $3.6 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $43.0 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is 5.9 years from january 1, 2023, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 1, 2023 was 4.9 years.
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. in difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. with respect to plans outside of the united states, we expect to contribute $6.8 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2023. during fiscal year 2023, we contributed $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2022. during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we contributed $6.6 million, $6.9 million and $7.5 million in the aggregate, respectively, to pension plans outside of the united states. during fiscal year 2021, we contributed $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states. we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.
we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations, and are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 1, 2023 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. however, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. see "business-environmental matters" above and note 16, contingencies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters and proceedings.
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1, nature of operations and accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements. we did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year 2022. we do not believe that any recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
business combinations. business combinations are accounted for at fair value. acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. for intangible assets, we normally utilize the "income method" which incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset, adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, (5) customer attrition rates, and (6) discount rates. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.
value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. we undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings.
for goodwill, the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 3, 2022, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. at january 3, 2022, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit. the range of the long-term terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 2.0% to 5.0% for the fiscal year 2022 impairment analysis. the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 7.0% to 11.5%. keeping all other variables constant, a 10.0% change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill.
in connection with the fiscal year 2023 impairment test performed as of january 2, 2023, the tulip and euroimmun reporting units, which had goodwill balances of $74.4 million and $572.0 million, respectively, at january 1, 2023, had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 20%. these reporting units are at increased risk of an impairment charge given the higher discount rates, competition and, to some extent, the recent impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. despite the increased impairment risk associated with these reporting units, we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of these reporting units that would lead to a material impairment charge.
we consistently employ the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years' cash flows and historical relationships in later years. the income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. the long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our long-term terminal growth rates. we corroborate the income approach with a market approach. while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.
employee compensation and benefits. we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.
we recognized gains of $28.3 million and $30.9 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which include the gains from the immediate recognition of the actuarial gains and losses for the benefit plans, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the loss or income related to the immediate recognition of the actuarial gains and losses on benefit plans were pre-tax gains of $28.9 million and $24.7 million fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. we expect an expense of approximately $13.3 million in fiscal year 2023 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding any actuarial gains and losses. it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict the amount of any actuarial gains and losses in fiscal year 2023 as these gains and losses are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, actuarial losses will impact our operating results. conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, actuarial gains will favorably impact our operating results. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee's approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. we use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.
if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 1, 2023, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:
increase (decrease) at january 1, 2023

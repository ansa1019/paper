business strategy
(all registrants)
ppl operates four fully regulated high-performing utilities. these utilities are located in pennsylvania, kentucky and rhode island, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes.
ppl's strategy, which is supported by the other registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve.
central to ppl's and the other registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual ferc formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. in kentucky, in addition to ferc formula rates, the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in pennsylvania, the ferc transmission formula rate, dsic mechanism, smart meter rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in rhode island, ferc formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (isr) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.
financial and operational developments
(ppl)
acquisition of narragansett electric on may 25, 2022, ppl rhode island holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of narragansett electric from national grid u.s. (the acquisition). the consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately $3.8 billion in cash and approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt assumed through the transaction. the $3.8 billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from ppl's 2021 sale of its u.k. utility business. the acquisition resulted in $1.6 billion of goodwill. the results of rie are reported in ppl's rhode island regulated segment.
the acquisition of narragansett electric was deemed an asset acquisition for federal and state income tax purposes, as a result of ppl and national grid making a tax election under internal revenue code (irc) §338(h)(10). accordingly, the tax bases of substantially all of the assets acquired were increased to fair market value, which equaled net book value, thereby eliminating the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. this election resulted in tax goodwill that will be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years.
see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.
sale of safari holdings on september 29, 2022, ppl signed a definitive agreement to sell all of safari holdings membership interests to aspen power services, llc. on november 1, 2022, ppl completed the sale (the transaction).
a loss on sale of $60 million ($46 million net of tax benefit) was recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2022. as a result of the transaction, $53 million of goodwill previously presented in the corporate and other category for segment reporting purposes was written-off.
see note 9 and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.
pennsylvania state tax reform (ppl and ppl electric)
on july 8, 2022, the governor of pennsylvania signed into law pennsylvania house bill 1342 (h.b. 1342). among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning january 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031.
gaap requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary book-to-tax differences are expected to be realized or settled. in 2022, ppl and ppl electric recorded an increase in regulatory liabilities of $270 million for the remeasurement of regulated accumulated deferred tax balances and a deferred tax benefit of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances. the amounts recorded are estimates that will be updated quarterly to reflect revised forecast, actual activity, and applicable orders from regulatory authorities.
inflation reduction act (all registrants)
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act (ira) was signed into law. among other things, the ira enacted a new 15% corporate "book minimum tax," which is based on adjusted gaap pre-tax income and is only applicable to corporations whose pre-tax income exceeds a certain threshold. ppl continues to assess the impacts of the ira on the financial statements of ppl and the other registrants and will monitor guidance issued by the u.s. treasury in the future. ppl does not anticipate a material cash tax impact in the foreseeable future. in addition, the ira enacted numerous new tax credits, largely associated with renewable energy. ppl continues to assess the applicability of these provisions to ppl and its subsidiaries.
regulatory requirements
(all registrants)
the registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.
environmental considerations for coal-fired generation (ppl, lg&e and ku)
the businesses of lg&e and ku are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to ccrs, ghg, and elgs. see notes 7, 14 and 20 to the financial statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. these and other environmental requirements led ppl, lg&e and ku to retire approximately 1,200 mw of coal-fired generating plants in kentucky since 2010. as part of the long-term generation planning process, lg&e and ku evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets.
as a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, lg&e anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the mill creek plant and ku anticipates retiring one coal-fired unit at each of the e.w. brown and ghent plants. mill creek unit 1, with 300 mw of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. mill creek unit 2, with 297 mw of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027. e.w. brown unit 3, with 412 mw of capacity, and ghent unit 2, with 486 mw of capacity, are expected to be retired in 2028. lg&e and ku anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the rar or other rate mechanisms.
cpcn (ppl, lg&e and ku)
on december 15, 2022, lg&e and ku filed an application with the kpsc for a cpcn for the construction of two 621 mw net summer rating ngcc combustion turbine facilities, one at lg&e's mill creek generating station in jefferson county, kentucky and the other at ku's e.w. brown generating station in mercer county, kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. lg&e and ku also applied for a cpcn to construct a 120 mwac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in mercer county, kentucky, and for a cpcn to acquire a 120 mwac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in marion county, kentucky. lg&e and ku further applied for a cpcn to construct a 125 mw, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at ku's e.w. brown generating station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 dsm programs. the plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce lg&e's and ku's overall need by approximately 100 mw each. finally, lg&e and ku requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 mw does not require kpsc approval and that lg&e and ku may recover the costs of the solar ppas through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar ppa. lg&e and ku plan to accrue afudc on the constructed ngccs, solar facility in mercer county, kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects.
the plan is consistent with ppl's goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. the replacement strategy, if approved, would reduce the carbon intensity of lg&e and ku's generation fleet and result in nearly a 25% reduction in co2 emissions from existing levels.
the kpsc accepted the filing as of january 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by november 6, 2023. lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these matters.
ferc transmission rate filing (ppl, lg&e and ku)
in 2018, lg&e and ku applied to the ferc requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of lg&e's and ku's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of lg&e and ku from the midcontinent independent system operator, inc. (miso), a regional transmission operator and energy market. the application sought termination of lg&e's and ku's commitment to provide certain kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 lg&e and ku merger and 2006 miso withdrawal. the amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of kentucky municipalities for either certain lg&e and ku or miso transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. in 2019, the ferc granted lg&e's and ku's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by lg&e and ku of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the ferc in 2020 and 2021. in 2020, lg&e and ku and other parties filed appeals with the d.c. circuit court of appeals regarding the ferc's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. on august 4, 2022, the d.c. circuit court of appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the ferc. lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings at the ferc on remand. lg&e and ku currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become effective.
rate case proceedings (ku)
on august 31, 2021, ku filed a request with the vscc for an annual increase in virginia base electricity rates of approximately $12 million, based on an authorized 10.4% return on equity. on march 11, 2022, ku, certain intervenors and the vscc staff reached a partial stipulation and recommendation agreement providing ku with an increase in base electricity rates of approximately $7 million based on an authorized 9.4% return on equity. a hearing on open issues occurred on march 17, 2022. on may 25, 2022, the vscc issued an order approving the proposed agreement. new rates became effective june 1, 2022.

earnings from ongoing operations management utilizes "earnings from ongoing operations" as a non-gaap financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with gaap. ppl believes that earnings from ongoing operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of ppl's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. in addition, ppl's management uses earnings from ongoing operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.
earnings from ongoing operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. special items may include items such as:
•    gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
•    impairment charges.
•    significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.
•    acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.
•    significant losses on early extinguishment of debt.
•    other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.

adjusted gross margins management also utilizes the following non-gaap financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.
•"kentucky adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the kentucky regulated segment, as well as the kentucky regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. in calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from operating revenues. in addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "other operation and maintenance", "depreciation" and "taxes, other than income" on the statements of income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. these mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.
•"pennsylvania adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the pennsylvania regulated segment. in calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a plr, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "energy purchases," "other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily act 129, storm damage and universal service program costs), "depreciation" (which is primarily related to the act 129 smart meter program) and "taxes, other than income," (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the statements of income. this measure represents the net revenues from the pennsylvania regulated segment's electricity delivery operations.
•"rhode island adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the rhode island regulated segment, as well as the rhode island regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. in calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms are offset with minimal impact on earnings. costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "energy purchases," "other operation and maintenance" (which are primarily regional network transmission service, energy efficiency and storm cost related) and "taxes, other than income" (which is primarily gross earnings tax) on the statements of income. this measure represents the net revenues from rhode island regulated segment's electricity and gas delivery operations.
these measures are not intended to replace "operating income," which is determined in accordance with gaap, as an indicator of overall operating performance. other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. these performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and ppl's board of directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.

kentucky adjusted gross margins kentucky adjusted gross margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher base rates of $105 million, environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $66 million and higher sales volumes primarily due to weather of $29 million.
the increase in base rates was the result of new rates approved by the kpsc effective july 1, 2021. the environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain ecr and glt expenses into base rates as a result of the 2020 kentucky rate case. this transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the ecr and glt programs being excluded from margins for all twelve months in 2022 compared to six months in 2021.
pennsylvania adjusted gross margins distribution distribution adjusted gross margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher sales volumes of $17 million which included favorable weather of $11 million. late payment charges increased $10 million as a result of not charging late payment fees for much of 2021 due to the covid-19 pandemic. tcja margins increased $11 million due to lower taxable income associated with the mechanism. merchant function charge, which is added to the ptc rates to offset uncollectible expenses, increased by $8 million largely due to the energy price increases.
transmission transmission adjusted gross margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $29 million increase as a result of a higher annual ppl zonal peak load billing factor in 2022 and $38 million of returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability.
rhode island adjusted gross margins rhode island adjusted gross margins increased for 2022 compared with 2021, due to the acquisition of narragansett electric on may 25, 2022.

(ppl)
ppl cash provided by operating activities in 2022 increased $186 million compared with 2021.
•net income increased $696 million between periods and included a decrease in net non-cash charges of $153 million. the decrease in non-cash charges was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the impairment of solar panels in 2021, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits.

(a)the syndicated credit facilities, term loans and ppl capital funding's bilateral facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for ppl capital funding, ppl electric, lg&e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.
the commitments under the credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: ppl - 14%, ppl electric - 18%, lg&e - 19% and ku - 21%.
(b)each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility. borrowings generally bear interest at libor-based rates, or applicable sofr, plus an applicable margin.
(c)commercial paper issued reflects the undiscounted face value of the issuance.
in addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. the registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. at december 31, 2022, the registrants were in compliance with these covenants. at this time, the registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

dividends/distributions
(ppl)
ppl views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts intended to maintain a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. in november 2022, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable january 3, 2023, at 22.50 cents per share (equivalent to $0.90 per annum). on february 17, 2023, ppl announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 24.00 cents per share, payable april 3, 2023, to shareowners of record as of march 10, 2023. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.
subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067. at december 31, 2022, no interest payments were deferred.
(ppl electric, lg&e and ku)
from time to time, as determined by their respective board of directors, the registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. certain of the credit facilities of ppl electric, lg&e and ku include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.
(all registrants)
see note 8 to the financial statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the registrants and their subsidiaries.
purchase or redemption of debt securities the registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. the amounts involved may be material.
rating agency actions moody's and s&p periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the registrants and their subsidiaries. based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the registrants and other sources. the ratings of moody's and s&p are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the registrants or their subsidiaries. such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.
the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. a downgrade in the registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. the registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.
the following table sets forth the registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2022.

the rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the registrants and their subsidiaries.
(ppl)
in june 2022, moody's affirmed its commercial paper rating for ppl capital funding and upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook:
• the long-term issuer rating from baa2 to baa1 for ppl;
• the senior unsecured rating from baa2 to baa1 for ppl capital funding;
• the junior subordinated rating from baa3 to baa2 for ppl capital funding; and
• the senior unsecured bank credit facility rating from baa2 to baa1 for ppl capital funding.
in june 2022, moody's upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook:
• the long-term issuer rating from baa1 to a3 for rie;
• the senior unsecured rating from baa1 to a3 for rie; and
• the preferred stock rating from baa3 to baa2 for rie.
in june 2022, s&p upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook:
• the long-term issuer rating from bbb+ to a- for rie;
• the senior unsecured rating from bbb+ to a- for rie; and
• the preferred stock rating from bbb- to bbb for rie.
(ppl and ppl electric)
in may 2022, s&p upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook for ppl electric:
• the long-term issuer credit rating from a- to a;
• the issue-level senior secured rating from a to a+; and
• the short-term and commercial paper ratings from a-2 to a-1.
ratings triggers (ppl, lg&e and ku)
various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if ppl's, lg&e's or ku's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. see note 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of "credit risk-related contingent features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for ppl and lg&e for derivative contracts in a net liability position at december 31, 2022.
guarantees for subsidiaries (ppl)
ppl guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. at this time, ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. see note 14 to the financial statements for additional information about guarantees.
other contingent obligations (all registrants)
the registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. see note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of these agreements.
risk management market risk
(all registrants)
see notes 1, 17 and 18 to the financial statements for information about the registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.
the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.
interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. a variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under ppl's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. in addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.
the following interest rate hedges were outstanding at december 31:

commodity price risk ppl is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•ppl electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a plr. potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its papuc-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its plr customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.
•lg&e's and ku's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. in addition, lg&e's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. these mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs.
•rie utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its ripuc-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. rie's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. rie's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its ripuc- approved cost recovery mechanisms. rie is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide last resort service (lrs). potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its ripuc-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve lrs customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. rie is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the rhode island renewable energy growth program and long-term clean energy standard. potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its ripuc-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices.
volumetric risk volumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. ppl is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•ppl electric, lg&e and ku are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.
•rie is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. rie's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to rie's delivery rates.
defined benefit plans - equity securities price risk see "application of critical accounting policies - defined benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.
credit risk
(all registrants)
credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.
ppl is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.
in the event a supplier of ppl, ppl electric, lg&e or ku defaults on its contractual obligation, those registrants would need to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. in general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.
ppl and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. these agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. ppl and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.
(all registrants)
related party transactions the registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the registrants. see note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on related party transactions for ppl electric, lg&e and ku.
acquisitions, development and divestitures the registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information on acquisition and divestiture activity. development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.
environmental matters extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the registrants' businesses. the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. in addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the registrants' services. increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. the registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.
see "legal matters" in note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. see note 20 to the financial statements for information related to the impacts of ccrs on aros. see "item 1. business - environmental matters" for additional information.
sustainability increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of "sustainability", which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. these parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. as a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. those efforts remain ongoing. in addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the sec promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the '34 act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 act reports. in march 2022, the sec proposed broad-based climate disclosure requirements for public companies. the proposed rule would require public companies to disclose direct and indirect ghg emissions, strategic insights, and certain financial implications in public disclosures. the proposed rulemaking elicited significant debate and comment. while a final rulemaking is currently expected to be issued in the spring of 2023, ppl cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective.
as has been ppl's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the registrants' financial condition or results of operation, ppl discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and sec regulations. with respect to other sustainability topics that ppl deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and sec regulation, ppl will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this form 10-k by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this form 10-k. in preparing its sustainability report, ppl is guided by the framework established by the global reporting initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. ppl also participates in efforts by the edison electric institute and american gas association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industry. additionally, ppl consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues. ppl also responds to the climate survey of cdp, a not-for-profit organization based in the united kingdom formerly known as the carbon disclosure project, that runs the global disclosure system that enables investors, companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts.
cybersecurity see "cybersecurity management" in "item 1. business" and "item 1a. risk factors" for a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting the registrants and the related strategies for managing these risks.
competition see "competition" under each of ppl's reportable segments in "item 1. business - general - segment information" and "item 1a. risk factors" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the registrants.
new accounting guidance there has been no new accounting guidance adopted in 2022 and there is no new significant accounting guidance pending adoption as of december 31, 2022.
application of critical accounting policies financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. the following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in note 1 to the financial statements). senior management has reviewed with ppl's audit committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.
defined benefits
(all registrants)
certain of the registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. see notes 1, 7 and 12 to the financial statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.
a summary of plan sponsors by registrant and whether a registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (s) or participate in and receives allocations (p) from those plans is shown in the table below.
plan sponsor         ppl         ppl electric         lg&amp;e       ku ppl services         s           p lke                                                   p              p management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. as such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in aoci or, in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. these amounts in aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. the significant assumptions are:
•discount rate - in selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. the plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. the plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.
•expected return on plan assets - the expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.
•rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. in selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.
see note 12 to the financial statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. a variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities.
the following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the registrants' primary defined benefit plans. the inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities. the sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

income taxes (all registrants)
significant management judgment is required in developing the registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. on a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. when evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
see note 6 to the financial statements for income tax disclosures.
regulatory assets and liabilities (all registrants)
ppl electric, lg&e, ku and rie are subject to cost-based rate regulation. as a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under gaap for non-regulated entities. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.
see note 7 to the financial statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at december 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. all regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.
price risk management (ppl)
see "financial condition - risk management" above.
goodwill impairment (ppl, lg&e and ku)
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. the reporting units of ppl include the kentucky regulated reporting unit, the pennsylvania regulated reporting unit, and the rhode island regulated reporting unit. lg&e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments and each are single reporting units. a goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value.
management assigned the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the rie acquisition to the rhode island regulated reporting unit. for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, rie goodwill of $1,586 million was assigned to ppl's reporting units. to determine the amount of the rie goodwill assigned to ppl's reporting units, management calculated the fair value of the kentucky regulated and the pennsylvania regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit to those reporting units. the difference in the fair values of the kentucky regulated and pennsylvania regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit from the acquisition of rie represents goodwill derived from the acquisition and was assigned to the respective reporting units. the remainder of the rie goodwill was assigned to the rhode island regulated reporting unit.
the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.
ppl, for its reporting units, and individually lg&e and ku may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. see "long-lived and intangible assets - asset impairment (excluding investments)" in note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. see note 19 to the financial statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at december 31, 2022.
as of october 1, 2022, ppl, for its reporting units, and individually, lg&e and ku, elected to perform quantitative annual goodwill impairment tests. management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of reporting units. significant assumptions used in these approaches included discount and growth rates, projected outcomes of future rate filings, projected operating and capital cash flows, and select market data. projected operating and capital cash flows are based on the internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain future events.
there were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units as the fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values.
asset retirement obligations (lg&e and ku)
aro liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. an aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated. an equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life.
in determining aros, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the aro was incurred. changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the aro estimate. any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.
see "long-lived and intangible assets - asset retirement obligations" in note 1, note 7 and note 20 to the financial statements for additional information on aros.
at december 31, 2022, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded aros were as follows.
most significant aros total            amount                          % of total               description aro            recorded recorded lg&amp;e           $86                 $65                               76                     ponds, landfills and natural gas mains ku                  82        55                                         67                     ponds and landfills the most significant assumptions surrounding aros are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. at december 31, 2022, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these aro liabilities by $7 million at lg&e and $10 million at ku. a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these aro liabilities by $5 million at lg&e and $1 million at ku and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these aro liabilities by $4 million at lg&e. there would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the aro asset or the annual accretion expense of the aro liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.
revenue recognition - unbilled revenues (all registrants)
for rie, lg&e and ku, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. the unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.
for ppl electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff. in the fourth quarter of 2022, ppl electric estimated deliveries to customers due to a temporary technical system issue. these estimates took into consideration factors similar to those considered by rie, lg&e and ku discussed above. the technical system issue has been resolved and unbilled revenues are expected to resume being calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff in the first quarter of 2023.
other information (all registrants)
ppl's audit committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by sarbanes-oxley and sec rules. the audit and audit-related services include services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings, reviews of offering documents and registration statements, and internal control reviews.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial presentation the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results. you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. see also "cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" immediately prior to part i, item 1 in this annual report.
we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either "passenger ticket" revenue or "onboard and other" revenue. passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering, the size of the ship in operation, the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates. our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises, which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere's summer months; however, our cruise voyages were completely suspended from march 2020 until july 2021 due to the covid-19 pandemic and our resumption of cruise voyages was phased in gradually, with full operation of our fleet resumed in may 2022 as described under "-update regarding covid-19 pandemic" below. passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations, meals in certain restaurants on the ship, certain onboard entertainment, port fees and taxes and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us. onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino, beverage sales, shore excursions, specialty dining, retail sales, spa services and wi-fi services. our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires, from which we receive a share of their revenue.
our cruise operating expense is classified as follows:
●   commissions, transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue. these costs include travel advisor commissions, air and land transportation expenses, related credit card fees, certain port fees and taxes and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price.

●   onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue, including casino, beverage sales and shore excursions.

●   payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items, including food, for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships. the cost of crew repatriation, including charters, housing, testing and other costs related to covid-19 are also included.

●   fuel includes fuel costs, the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs.

●   food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships.

●   other consists of repairs and maintenance (including dry-dock costs), ship insurance and other ship expenses.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments. actual results could differ materially from these estimates. we believe that the following
51
critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. these critical accounting policies, which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, relate to liquidity, ship accounting and asset impairment.
liquidity we make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our liquidity.
significant events affecting travel typically have an impact on demand for cruise vacations, with the full extent of the impact determined by the length of time the event influences travel decisions. the level of occupancy on our ships will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the conditions discussed below under "macroeconomic trends and uncertainties", further resurgences of covid-19 or the emergence of other public health crises and any related governmental regulations and new health and safety protocols, port availability, travel restrictions, bans and advisories, and our ability to staff our ships. in addition, as a result of conditions associated with the covid-19 pandemic and other global events, such as russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to the invasion, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including increases in inflation rates, fuel prices, and interest rates. these conditions have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased expenses and also have impacted travel and consumer discretionary spending. we believe the ongoing effects of the foregoing factors and events on our operations and global bookings have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our financial results and liquidity.
the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. our principal assumptions for future cash flow projections include:
●   expected gradual return to historical occupancy levels;

●   expected increase in revenue per passenger cruise day through a combination of both passenger ticket and onboard revenue as compared to 2019;

●   forecasted cash collections in accordance with the terms of our credit card processing agreements (see note 13 - "commitments and contingencies"); and

●   expected sustained higher fuel prices and the impact of inflation.

our projected liquidity requirements also reflect our principal assumptions surrounding ongoing operating costs, as well as liquidity requirements for financing costs and necessary capital expenditures. we cannot make assurances that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will not change materially due to the dynamic nature of the current economic landscape. accordingly, the full effect of the covid-19 pandemic and other global events impacting macroeconomic conditions and travel and consumer discretionary spending, including russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine, on our financial performance and financial condition cannot be quantified at this time. we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of these events within our financial statements; however, there may be material changes to those estimates in future periods. we have taken actions to improve our liquidity, including completing various capital market and financing transactions and making capital expenditure and operating expense reductions, and we expect to continue to pursue further opportunities to improve our liquidity.
ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets, and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15% reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship. our residual value is established based on our long-term estimates of the expected remaining future benefit at the end of the ships' weighted average useful lives. in the third quarter of 2022, the company took delivery of norwegian's first prima class ship. based on the design, structure and technological advancements made to this new class of ship and the analysis of its major components, which is generally performed upon the introduction of a new class of ship, we have assigned the prima class ships a weighted-average
52
useful life of 35 years with a residual value of 10%. ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship. when we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship's cost basis, we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship's cost basis. repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. we account for dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all dry-dock costs as incurred.
we determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the costs and useful lives of the ships' major component systems on the date of acquisition, such as cabins, main diesels, main electric, superstructure and hull, and their related proportional weighting to the ship as a whole. the useful lives of components of new ships and ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. in addition, to determine the useful lives of the major components of new ships and ship improvements, we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives, planned maintenance programs and anticipated changes in technological conditions. given the large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain. should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher. in 2020, one ship had significant improvements that extended the remaining weighted average useful life of the vessel. accordingly, we updated our estimate of both its useful life and residual value based on the new weighted average useful life of its current components. the impact of the change in estimate was accounted on a prospective basis and was not material.
if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. if we reduced our estimated weighted average ship service life by one year, depreciation expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 would have increased by $18.8 million. in addition, if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $82.8 million. we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied. we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships' usage.
asset impairment we review our long-lived assets, principally ships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. for ship impairment analyses, the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship. we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates, judgments and projections as necessary. our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk.
we evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment on december 31 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. for our evaluation of goodwill, we use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. for trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
53
in order to make this evaluation, we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist:
●   changes in general macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions; limitations on accessing capital; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; or other developments in equity and credit markets;

●   changes in industry and market conditions such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates; an increased competitive environment; a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (in both absolute terms and relative to peers); a change in the market for an entity's products or services; or a regulatory or political development;

●   changes in cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;

●   decline in overall financial performance (for both actual and expected performance);

●   entity and reporting unit specific negative events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; litigation; or a change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets; and

●   decline in share price (in both absolute terms and relative to peers).

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our long-lived assets, principally ships, goodwill, tradenames and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable. nonetheless, if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets, we could be required to record an impairment charge. if a material change occurred or the result of the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, we would conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value to its carrying value.
we have concluded that our business has three reporting units. each brand, oceania cruises, regent seven seas and norwegian, constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment.
for our annual impairment evaluation, we performed a qualitative assessment for the regent seven seas reporting unit and of each brand's trade names. as part of our analysis, we performed an assessment of current factors compared to key assumptions impacting the quantitative tests performed in 2020. as of december 31, 2022, there was $98.1 million of goodwill remaining for the regent seven seas reporting unit. trade names were $500.5 million as of december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, our annual impairment reviews support the carrying values of these assets.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, such as adjusted gross margin, net cruise cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel, adjusted ebitda, adjusted net loss and adjusted eps, to enable us to analyze our performance. see "terms used in this annual report" for the definitions of these and other non-gaap financial measures. we utilize adjusted gross margin to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because it reflects revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. we also utilize net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts our results of operations, we believe changes in adjusted gross margin, net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.
as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the u.s., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly british pound, canadian dollar, euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-gaap measures on a constant
54
currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. we believe that presenting these non-gaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income, as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.
in addition, adjusted net loss and adjusted eps are non-gaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net loss and eps. we use adjusted net loss and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance. we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. these non-gaap financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparison to our historical performance. in addition, management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation during normal operations. the amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of adjusted net loss and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. for example, for the year ended december 31, 2022, we incurred $12.1 million related to restructuring costs or charges. we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net loss since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations; however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this form 10-k.
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-gaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-gaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. in evaluating our non-gaap financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. our non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our presentation of our non-gaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the "results of operations" section.
update regarding covid-19 pandemic safe resumption of operations due to the impact of covid-19, travel restrictions and limited access to ports around the world, in march 2020, we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands. in the third quarter of 2021, we began a phased relaunch of certain cruise voyages with ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels. in early may 2022, we completed the phased relaunch of our entire fleet with all ships now in operation with guests on board. occupancy levels have sequentially increased in recent quarters, most recently averaging 87% in the fourth quarter 2022, with the company expecting to return to historical occupancy levels for the second quarter of 2023.
during 2022, we benefitted from significant improvements in the public health environment which allowed for the removal of most covid-19 related health and safety protocols by year-end, unless required by local jurisdictions. for example, in july 2022, the cdc announced that its voluntary covid-19 program for cruise ships operating in u.s. waters was no longer in effect. we will continue to modify and evolve our health and safety protocols as needed along with the broader public health and regulatory environments. we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our guests, crew and communities we visit and follow applicable travel guidelines and local protocols as required by the ports and destinations we visit.
55
the relaxation of protocols, continued easing of travel restrictions and reopening of most ports around the globe to cruise ships has improved travel experiences, expanded the addressable cruise market, allowed us to expand the variety of our itineraries and provided additional catalysts on the road to recovery.
modified policies we have launched cancellation policies for certain sailings booked during certain time periods to permit certain guests to cancel cruises which were not part of a temporary suspension of voyages up to 15 days prior to embarkation for cruises embarking prior to december 31, 2022 or in the event of a positive covid-19 test and receive a refund in the form of a credit to be applied toward a future cruise. standard payment schedules and cancellation penalties apply for all sailings after december 31, 2022. the future cruise credits that have been issued as face value reimbursement for cancelled bookings due to covid-19 are generally valid for any sailing through june 30, 2023, and we may further extend the length of time these future cruise credits may be redeemed. the use of such credits may prevent us from garnering certain future cash collections as staterooms booked by guests with such credits will not be available for sale, resulting in less cash collected from bookings to new guests. we may incur incremental commission expense for the use of these future cruise credits.
financing transactions in 2022 and 2023, we continued to take actions to bolster our financial condition as part of our long-term post-pandemic financial recovery strategy. in february 2022, we received additional financing through various debt financings, collectively totaling $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, which was used to redeem all of the outstanding 2024 senior secured notes and 2026 senior secured notes and to make scheduled principal payments on debt maturing in 2022, including, in each case, to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in december 2022, we amended the senior secured credit facility to extend approximately $1.4 billion of maturities by one year to january 2025. the amendment also updated certain financial covenants and increased our ability to incur additional debt. each of our export-credit backed facilities were also amended to conform the financial covenants with the senior secured credit facility. in february 2023, a commitment of $82.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the revolving loan facility that was not previously extended was obtained to assign the commitment to a new lender under the same terms as the extending lenders.
in february 2023, nclc issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. the proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our term loan a facility that otherwise would have become due in january 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in july 2022, we amended our $1 billion commitment, which provided additional liquidity to the company through march 31, 2023. in february 2023, the commitment was further extended through february 2024, with an option for nclc to further extend the commitments through february 2025 at its election. simultaneously, the amount of the commitment was reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution of the amended commitment letter, nclc issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028. nclc will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
in february 2023, nclc entered into a backstop agreement with ms, pursuant to which ms has agreed to provide backstop committed financing to refinance and/or repay in whole or in part up to $300 million of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.
refer to note 8 - "long-term debt" for further details about the above transactions.
56
update on bookings the company entered the year with a record cumulative booked position of approximately 62% for full year 2023, in line with previously outlined expectations and within the company's optimal 60% to 65% range, and at higher prices than 2019 at a similar point in time. booking volumes have accelerated in recent months buoyed by strong wave season demand. the company's brands achieved several booking records in recent months including at norwegian cruise line which reached an all-time record booking month in november, boosted by black friday and cyber monday, which was subsequently exceeded in january 2023. as a result, full year 2023 cumulative booked position is ahead of 2019 levels inclusive of the company's approximately 19% increase in capacity, at continued higher pricing. net booking volumes continue to be at the pace needed to reach historical occupancy levels for the second quarter of 2023 and beyond; however, our full fleet may not achieve historical occupancy levels on our expected schedule and as a result, current booking data may not be informative. in addition, because of our cancellation policies, bookings may not be representative of actual cruise revenues.
there are uncertainties about when our full fleet will be back at historical occupancy levels and, accordingly, we cannot estimate the impact on our business, financial condition or near- or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty; however, we will report a net loss for the first quarter of 2023.
macroeconomic trends and uncertainties as a result of conditions associated with global events, including the downstream effects of the covid-19 pandemic and russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to the invasion, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including increases in inflation rates, fuel prices, and interest rates. our costs have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by these increases. we have used, and may continue to use, derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in fuel prices and interest expense. in an attempt to mitigate risks related to inflation, our supply chain department has negotiated contracts with varying terms, with a goal of providing us with the ability to take advantage of cost declines when they occur, and diversified our sourcing options. these strategies may not fully offset the impact of current macroeconomic conditions. furthermore, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for certain portions of ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. see "item 1a-risk factors" for additional information.
climate change we believe the increasing focus on climate change and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations. we expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements, which may include expenses related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction initiatives and the purchase of emissions allowances, among other things. if requirements become more stringent, we may be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, which could adversely impact our operations. we are evaluating the effects of global climate change related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; consequently, the full impact to the company is not yet known. additionally, our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. for example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. see item 1a, "risk factors" for additional information.

year ended december 31, 2022 ("2022") compared to year ended december 31, 2021 ("2021")
revenue total revenue increased 647.5% to $4.8 billion in 2022 compared to $0.6 billion in 2021. in 2022, revenue primarily increased as we returned to service with 12.8 million passenger cruise days compared to 1.8 million in 2021.
61
expense total cruise operating expense increased 165.4% in 2022 compared to 2021. in 2022, the year started with 16 ships operating with guests onboard and ended with the entire 29-ship fleet in service compared to 2021, during which only 16 ships were returned to service in the second half of the year. in 2022, our cruise operating expenses increased as more ships resumed voyages, resulting in higher payroll, fuel, and direct variable costs of fully operating ships. costs for certain items such as food, fuel and logistics also increased related to inflation. gross cruise cost increased 125.9% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily related to the change in costs described above plus an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses primarily related to increased marketing costs as we returned to service. total other operating expense increased 33.7% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses.
interest expense, net was $0.8 billion in 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in 2021. the decrease in 2022 primarily reflects lower losses from extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs, which were $1.4 billion in 2021. excluding these losses, interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher debt balances and higher rates partially offset by lower interest expense in connection with refinancings.
other income (expense), net was income of $76.6 million in 2022 compared to $124.0 million in 2021. other income in 2022 and 2021 was primarily due to gains on fuel swaps not designated as hedges and foreign currency remeasurements.
liquidity and capital resources general as of december 31, 2022, our liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 billion and a $1 billion undrawn commitment, less related fees, available through march 31, 2023. our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. as of december 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $3.2 billion. this deficit included $2.5 billion of advance ticket sales, which represents the total revenue we collected in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities. our business model, along with our liquidity and undrawn export-credit backed facilities, allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
in february 2022, we received additional financing through various debt financings, collectively totaling $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, which was used to redeem all of the outstanding 2024 senior secured notes and 2026 senior secured notes and to make scheduled principal payments on debt maturing in 2022, including, in each case, to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in december 2022, we amended our senior secured credit facility to extend approximately $1.4 billion of maturities by one year to january 2025, subject to, if a one-time minimum liquidity threshold is not satisfied on september 16, 2024, a springing maturity date of september 16, 2024. the amendment also updated certain financial covenants and increased our ability to incur additional debt. each of our export-credit backed facilities were also amended to conform the financial covenants with the senior secured credit facility. in february 2023, a commitment of $82.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the revolving loan facility that was not previously extended was obtained to assign the commitment to a new lender under the same terms as the extending lenders.
in february 2023, nclc issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028. the proceeds from the notes were used to repay the loans outstanding under our term loan a facility that otherwise would have become due in january 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as related premiums, fees and expenses.
in july 2022, we amended our $1 billion commitment, which provided additional liquidity to the company through march 31, 2023. in february 2023, the commitment was further extended through february 2024, with an option for nclc to further extend the commitments through february 2025 at its election. simultaneously, the amount of the commitment was reduced to $650 million, which may be drawn in up to two draws, and in connection with the execution
62
of the amended commitment letter, nclc issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028. nclc will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
in february 2023, nclc entered into a backstop agreement with ms, pursuant to which ms has agreed to provide backstop committed financing to refinance and/or repay in whole or in part up to $300 million of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility at any time between october 4, 2023 and january 2, 2024.
refer to note 8 - "long-term debt" for further details about the above financing transactions.
the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. refer to note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" for further information on liquidity and management's plan. refer to item 1a, "risk factors" for further details regarding uncertainty related to russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and other risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ from our expectations.
there can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the dynamic nature of the current operating environment, including the impacts of the covid-19 global pandemic, russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and current macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, rising fuel prices and rising interest rates. based on the liquidity estimates and our current resources, we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months. nonetheless, we anticipate that we will need additional equity and/or debt financing to fund our operations in the future if a substantial portion of our fleet suspends cruise voyages or operates at reduced occupancy levels for a prolonged period. there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations. beyond 12 months, we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions from time to time in order to reduce interest expense or extend debt maturities. we expect to collaborate with financing institutions regarding these refinancing and optimization transactions as opportunities arise in the short-term to amend long-term arrangements.
we have received amendments to certain financial and other debt covenants, including the modification of our free liquidity requirements. at december 31, 2022, taking into account such amendments, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. if we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants, we would have to seek additional amendments to or waivers of the covenants. however, no assurances can be made that such amendments or waivers would be approved by our lenders. generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default and/or cross acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated, which would have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity.
since march 2020, moody's has downgraded our long-term issuer rating to b2, our senior secured rating to b1 and our senior unsecured rating to caa1. in september 2022, moody's reaffirmed our current ratings. since april 2020, s&p global has downgraded our issuer credit rating to b, lowered our issue-level rating on our $875 million revolving loan facility and $1.5 billion term loan a facility to bb-, our issue-level rating on our other senior secured notes to b+ and our senior unsecured rating to b-. if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted. we also have capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time, subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares. however, there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.
as of december 31, 2022, we had advance ticket sales of $2.7 billion, including the long-term portion, which included approximately $144.0 million of future cruise credits. we also have agreements with our credit card processors that, as of december 31, 2022, governed approximately $2.4 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the company relating to future voyages. these agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances, including the existence of a material adverse change, excessive chargebacks and other triggering events, that the company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral. although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash
63
funds directly to the card processor. any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased. as of december 31, 2022, we had cash collateral reserves of approximately $622.0 million with credit card processors, of which approximately $118.4 million is recognized in accounts receivable, net and approximately $503.6 million in other long-term assets. we may be required to pledge additional collateral and/or post additional cash reserves or take other actions that may reduce our liquidity.
sources and uses of cash in this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended december 31, 2022, references to 2021 refer to the year ended december 31, 2021.
net cash provided by operating activities was $210.0 million in 2022 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2021. the net cash used in operating activities included net losses due to the suspension of global cruise voyages from march 2020 through july 2021, the subsequent resumption of cruise voyages through may 2022 and the timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities. the net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 included net losses of $(2.3) billion, an increase in advance ticket sales of $928.9 million and loss on extinguishment of $188.8 million. the net cash used in operating activities in 2021 included net losses of $(4.5) billion and a decrease of $1.2 billion in cash from accounts receivable, which includes our collateral reserves with credit card processors, offset by an increase in advance ticket sales of $521.9 million and loss on extinguishment of $1.4 billion.
net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2022, primarily related to the delivery of norwegian prima. net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion in 2021, primarily related to newbuild payments and ship improvement projects and net purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to newbuild loans and the proceeds of $2.1 billion from our various note offerings partially offset by debt repayments and related redemption premiums associated with extinguishment of certain senior secured notes. net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to $2.6 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and $2.7 billion in proceeds from issuance of nclh's ordinary shares offset by $2.1 billion of debt principal repayments and $1.4 billion of early redemption premiums.
for the company's cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, see "item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on march 1, 2022.
future capital commitments future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts. anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts are $2.4 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ending december 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. we have export-credit backed financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $1.9 billion, $0.1 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ending december 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures are $0.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023. future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.
for the norwegian brand, we have five prima class ships on order, each ranging from approximately 143,500 to 169,000 gross tons with 3,100 or more berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2023 through 2028. for the regent brand, we have one explorer class ship on order to be delivered in 2023, which will be approximately 55,000 gross tons and 750 berths. for the oceania cruises brand, we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025. each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67,000 gross tons and 1,200 berths.
64
as of december 31, 2022, the combined contract prices of the eight ships on order for delivery was approximately €6.7 billion, or $7.2 billion based on the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate as of december 31, 2022. contract amendments for certain of our ships that are or will become effective subsequent to december 31, 2022 will increase the contract cost by €1.2 billion, of which $0.5 billion is included in the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts discussed above. we have obtained or expect to obtain fixed rate export-credit backed financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship, subject to certain conditions. we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur. however, if any such events were to occur, it could result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

funding sources certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity, as well as limit our net funded debt-to-capital ratio and maintain certain other ratios. approximately $13.7 billion of our assets are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt. we have received amendments to certain financial
65
and other debt covenants, including the modification of our free liquidity requirements. after taking into account such amendments, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2022.
in addition, our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of our subsidiaries, including nclc, to make distributions and/or pay dividends to nclh and nclh's ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh. however, we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations.
we believe our cash on hand, the impact of the undrawn commitment less related fees, the backstop financing available from october 4, 2023 through january 2, 2024, the expected return of a portion of the cash collateral from our credit card processors, expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities, will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12-month period. refer to "-liquidity and capital resources-general" for further information regarding the debt covenant waivers and liquidity requirements.
other certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business. the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions.
as a routine part of our business, depending on market conditions, exchange rates, pricing and our strategy for growth, we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. we may also consider the sale of ships, potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. if any of these transactions were to occur, they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness, through cash flows from operations, or through the issuance of debt, equity or equity-related securities.
we refer you to "-liquidity and capital resources-general" for information regarding collateral provided to our credit card processors.

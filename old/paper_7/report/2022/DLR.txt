revenue base most of our revenue consists of rental income generated by the data centers in our portfolio. our ability to generate and grow revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve occupancy rates. a summary of our data center portfolio and related square feet occupied (excluding space under development or held for development) is shown below. unconsolidated portfolios shown below consist of assets owned by unconsolidated entities in which we have invested. we often provide management services for these entities under management agreements and receive management fees. these are shown as managed unconsolidated portfolio. entities for which we do not provide such services are shown as non-managed unconsolidated portfolio.

index to financial statements leasing activities due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations we support, our lease terms with customers are generally longer than standard commercial leases. as of december 31, 2022, our average remaining lease term was approximately five years.
our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. the subsequent table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended december 31, 2022 (square feet amount in thousands):

(1)   for some of our properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area.

(2)   rental rates represent average annual estimated base cash rent per rentable square foot - calculated for each contract based on total cash base rent divided by the total number of years in the contract (including any tenant concessions). all rates were calculated in the local currency of each contract and then converted to usd based on average exchange rates for the period presented.

(3)   excludes short-term leases.

(4)   commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2022 to 2023.

(5)   includes leases signed for new and re-leased space.

(6)   other includes powered base building shell capacity as well as storage and office space within fully improved data center facilities.

we continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, we expect average aggregate rental rates on renewed data center leases for 2023 expirations to be positive as compared with the rates currently being paid for the same space on a gaap basis and on a cash basis. our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our data centers will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local economic conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.

index to financial statements geographic concentration we depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional or metropolitan areas can impact our future results. the following table shows the geographic concentration of annualized rent from our portfolio, including data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities.

(1)   annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of december 31, 2022 multiplied by 12. includes consolidated portfolio and unconsolidated entities at the entities' 100% ownership level. the aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended december 31, 2022 was approximately $117.3 million.

operating expenses operating expenses primarily consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. our buildings require significant power to support data center operations and the cost of electric power and other utilities is a significant component of operating expenses.
many of our leases contain provisions under which tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. however, in some cases we are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for turn-key flex® facilities. we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.
costs pertaining to our asset management function, legal, accounting, corporate governance, reporting and compliance are categorized as general and administrative costs within operating expenses.
other key components of operating expenses include: depreciation of our fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, and transaction and integration costs.

index to financial statements other income / (expenses)
equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, gain on disposition of properties, interest expense, and income tax expense make up the majority of other income/(expense). equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities represents our share of the income/(loss) of entities in which we invest, but do not consolidate under u.s. gaap. the largest of these investments is currently our investment in ascenty, which is located primarily in latin america. our second-largest equity-method investment is digital core reit, which is publicly traded on the singapore exchange ("sgx") and which owns a portfolio of 11 properties operating in the united states, canada and germany. refer to additional discussion of digital core reit and ascenty in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations as a result of the consistent and significant growth in our business since the first property acquisition in 2002, we evaluate period-to-period results for revenue and property level operating expenses on a stabilized versus non-stabilized portfolio basis.
stabilized: the stabilized portfolio includes properties owned as of the beginning of all periods presented with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development.

total operating revenues increased by approximately $264.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 driven primarily by growth in non-stabilized rental and other services revenue.
stabilized rental and other services revenue decreased by $45.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $131.9 million unfavorable foreign currency translation effect (primarily related to weaking of the euro and british pound sterling versus the u.s. dollar) partially offset by a net increase in tenant reimbursements related to higher utility consumption of $97.5 million.
non-stabilized rental and other services revenue increased $313.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by:
(i)   an increase of $368.3 million due to the completion of global development pipeline and related lease up operating activities, with $94.8 million generated from an apac property, which came online in the second quarter of 2021 and was fully operational by the first quarter of 2022. the markets with the biggest contribution were singapore, portland, paris, dublin, frankfurt and amsterdam;

(ii)   $71.4 million generated as a result of teraco acquisition in august 2022;

(iii)   offset by a $126.7 million decrease from the impact of properties sold in 2021 and 2022.

index to financial statements property level operating expenses include costs to operate and maintain the properties in our portfolio as well as taxes and insurance.
total utilities total stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately $79.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in utility consumption and higher rates at certain properties in the stabilized portfolio of $116.5 million offset by a $37.1 million foreign currency translation effect.
total non-stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately $141.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher utility consumption in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites of $160.7 million offset by a $17.7 million foreign currency translation effect.
total rental property operating and maintenance (excluding utilities)
total stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) decreased $3.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $24.0 million foreign currency translation effect partially offset by an increase in common area maintenance utilities and repairs and maintenance of $20.9 million.
total non-stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased $38.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher lease and common area maintenance expense in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites of approximately $51.6 million offset by a foreign currency translation effect primarily due to the euro versus the u.s. dollar of approximately $12.5 million.
the cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that the u.s. congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the u.s. epa has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the eu, apac or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our customers. these matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
total property taxes and insurance total stabilized property taxes and insurance decreased $12.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to $13.5 million of a reduction in property tax liabilities and property tax refunds spread across the portfolio, offset by a $1.6 million foreign currency translation effect.

equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $75.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to i) a $64 million gain recorded as a component of our share of earnings in the pgim joint venture which was associated with the joint venture's sale of a portfolio of 10 data centers in august 2021 and ii) the foreign exchange remeasurement of debt associated with our unconsolidated ascenty entity.
gain on disposition of properties gain on disposition of properties, decreased $1,204.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. the decrease was due primarily to i) gain of approximately $1 billion on the disposition of 10 operating properties to the sreit in december 2021, ii) gain of approximately $332.0 million in march 2021 associated with the sale of a portfolio of 11 data centers in europe (four in the united kingdom, three in the netherlands, three in france and one in switzerland) to ascendas reit, a capitaland sponsored reit, for total purchase consideration of approximately $680.0 million, offset by iii) the disposition of a property in the dallas market in august 2022 resulting in a net gain on sale of $174 million.
loss from early extinguishment of debt loss from early extinguishment of debt increased approximately $32.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. the increase is primarily due to the redemption of the 4.750% notes due 2025 in february 2022, which resulted in a $51.1 million loss, compared to the redemption 2.750% notes due 2023 in february 2021, which resulted in a $18.3 million loss.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased by $41.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. the decrease was driven primarily by i) the release of the valuation allowances against net operating losses in the netherlands and the inclusion of a teraco tax benefit in 2022 and ii) an increase in the corporate tax rate that increased deferred tax expense in the united kingdom from 19% to 25% during the quarter ended june 30, 2021.

index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources the sections "analysis of liquidity and capital resources - parent" and "analysis of liquidity and capital resources - operating partnership" should be read in conjunction with one another to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. the term "parent" refers to digital realty trust, inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our operating partnership. the term "operating partnership" or "op" refers to digital realty trust, l.p. on a consolidated basis.
analysis of liquidity and capital resources - parent our parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the operating partnership, issuing public equity from time to time, incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company (which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership) and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. if our operating partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger parent guarantee obligations, then our parent will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. our parent's only material asset is its investment in our operating partnership.
our parent's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. our parent's principal source of funding is the distributions it receives from our operating partnership.
as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, our parent has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership's day-to-day management and control. our parent causes our operating partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our parent may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our operating partnership's partnership agreement.
as circumstances warrant, our parent may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. any proceeds from such equity issuances would generally be contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our operating partnership. our operating partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.
our parent and our operating partnership are parties to an at-the-market (atm) equity offering sales agreement dated april 1, 2022 (the "sales agreement"). pursuant to the sales agreement, digital realty trust, inc. can issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.5 billion through various named agents from time to time. the sales of common stock made under the sales agreement will be made in "at the market" offerings as defined in rule 415 of the securities act. as of december 31, 2022, $1.5 billion remained available for future sales under the program. our parent intends to use the net proceeds from the program to temporarily repay borrowings under our operating partnership's global revolving credit facilities, to acquire additional properties or businesses, to fund development opportunities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potentially for the repayment of other debt or the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt securities.
on september 13, 2021, digital realty trust, inc. completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of its common stock, all of which were offered in connection with forward sale agreements it entered into with certain financial institutions acting as forward purchasers. the forward purchasers borrowed and sold an aggregate of 6,250,000 shares of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock in the public offering. digital realty trust, inc. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the forward purchasers in the public offering. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we fully settled the forward sale agreements by issuing 6.25 million shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $939.0 million. upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements, the operating partnership issued general partner common partnership units to digital realty trust, inc. in exchange for contribution of the net proceeds.
65
index to financial statements we believe our operating partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our parent and, in turn, for our parent to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. however, we cannot assure you that our operating partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our parent. the lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our operating partnership's ability to pay its distributions to our parent, which would in turn, adversely affect our parent's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.
future uses of cash - parent our parent may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our operating partnership or its subsidiaries through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
dividends and distributions - parent our parent is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis to continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our parent intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our operating partnership's operating activities. while historically our parent has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. all such distributions are at the discretion of our parent's board of directors. our parent considers market factors and our operating partnership's performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels. our parent has distributed at least 100% of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal and state income taxes. amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our parent's status as a reit.
as a result of this distribution requirement, our operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can. our parent may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our operating partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. in addition, our parent may be required to use borrowings under the operating partnership's global revolving credit facility (which is guaranteed by our parent), if necessary, to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our parent's reit status.
distributions out of our parent's current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income whereas distributions in excess of our parent's current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent's stock, are generally classified as a return of capital. distributions in excess of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent's stock are generally characterized as capital gain. cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis. however, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund distributions.
the expected tax treatment of distributions on our parent's common stock and preferred stock paid in 2022 is as follows: approximately 59% ordinary income, 16% as capital gain distribution, and 25% as nondividend distribution. the tax treatment of distributions on our parent's common stock and preferred stock paid in 2021 was as follows: approximately 9% ordinary income and 91% capital gain distribution. the tax treatment of distributions on our parent's common stock paid in 2020 was as follows: approximately 72% ordinary income and 28% capital gain distribution.

index to financial statements for additional information regarding dividends declared and paid by our parent on its common and preferred stock for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see item 8, note 14. "equity and capital" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein.
analysis of liquidity and capital resources - operating partnership as of december 31, 2022, we had $141.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $8.9 million of restricted cash. restricted cash primarily relates to future contractual capital expenditures plus other deposits. our liquidity requirements primarily consist of:
●   operating expenses,

●   development costs and other capital expenditures associated with our properties,

●   distributions to our parent to enable it to make dividend payments,

●   distributions to unitholders of common limited partnership interests in digital realty trust, l.p.,

●   debt service, and,

●   potentially, acquisitions.

on november 18, 2021, we refinanced our global revolving credit facility and yen revolving credit facility. on april 5, 2022, the operating partnership entered into an amendment of the global revolving credit facility which, among other things, increased the size of the global revolving credit facility from $3.0 billion to $3.75 billion. the global revolving credit facilities provide for borrowings of up to $4.05 billion (including approximately $0.3 billion available to be drawn on the yen revolving credit facility). the global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies and can be increased by an additional $750 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. both facilities mature on january 24, 2026, with two six-month extension options available.
these facilities also feature a sustainability-linked pricing component, with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our continued leadership and commitment to sustainable business practices.
the global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies, and includes the ability to add additional currencies in the future. we have used and intend to use available borrowings under the global revolving credit facilities to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities. for additional information regarding our global revolving credit facilities, see item 8, note 11. "debt of the operating partnership" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
future uses of cash our properties require periodic investments of capital for customer-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. depending upon customer demand, we expect to incur significant improvement costs to build out and develop additional capacity. at december 31, 2022, we had open commitments, related to construction contracts of approximately $2.6 billion, including amounts reimbursable of approximately $41.5 million.
we currently expect to incur approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of capital expenditures for our development programs during the year ending december 31, 2023. this amount could go up or down, potentially materially, based on numerous factors, including changes in demand, leasing results and availability of debt or equity capital.

(1)   we estimate the total net rentable square feet available for lease based on a number of factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common areas. excludes square footage of properties held in unconsolidated entities. square footage is based on current estimates and project plans, and may change upon completion of the project due to remeasurement.

(2)   represents balances incurred through december 31, 2022.

(3)   represents estimated cost to complete specific scope of work pursuant to contract, budget or approved capital plan.

(4)   represents balances incurred through december 31, 2021.

(5)   represents approximately 842 acres as of december 31, 2022 and approximately 849 acres as of december 31, 2021.

(6)   excludes space held for development through unconsolidated entities.

(7)   includes $402.8 million related to fair value adjustments on teraco locations that were partially constructed as of august 1, 2022.

land inventory and space held for development reflect cumulative cost spent pending future development. base building construction consists of ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future data center fit-out. data center construction includes 8.7 million square feet of turn key flex® and powered base building® product. generally, we expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules. equipment pool and other inventory represent the value of long-lead equipment and materials required for timely deployment and delivery of data center construction fit-out. campus, tenant improvements and other costs include the value of development work which benefits space recently converted to our operating portfolio and is composed primarily of shared infrastructure projects and first-generation tenant improvements.
capital expenditures (cash basis)
the table below summarizes our capital expenditure activity for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

index to financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2022, total capital expenditures increased $93.4 million to approximately $2,489.5 million from $2,396.1 million for the same period in 2021. capital expenditures on our development projects plus our enhancement and improvements projects for the year ended december 31, 2022 were approximately $2,223.1 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 2% from the same period in 2021. our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital.
indirect costs, including interest, capitalized in the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were $156.9 million and $124.7 million, respectively. capitalized interest comprised approximately $70.8 million and $53.5 million of the total indirect costs capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. capitalized interest in the year ended december 31, 2022 increased, compared to the same period in 2021, due to an increase in interest rates and qualifying activities. excluding capitalized interest, indirect costs in the year ended december 31, 2022 increased compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to increasing compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction activities.
consistent with our growth strategy, we actively pursue potential acquisition opportunities, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. the dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending december 31, 2023 will depend upon numerous factors, including customer demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities. further, the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower, as such private investors may often have lower return expectations than us. as a result, we anticipate near-term single asset acquisitions activity to comprise a smaller percentage of our growth while this market dynamic persists.
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our parent through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our parent in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
sources of cash we expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of scheduled debt maturities and funding of acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our parent. we also may fund future short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, using our global revolving credit facilities pending permanent financing. as of february 21, 2023, we had approximately $1.8 billion of borrowings available under our global revolving credit facilities.
our global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $3.75 billion. we have the ability from time to time to increase the size of the global revolving credit facility by up to $750 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. the global revolving credit facility matures on january 24, 2026, with two six-month extension options available. we have used and intend to use available borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity requirements from time to time. for additional information regarding our global revolving credit facility, see note 11. "debt of the operating partnership" to consolidated financial statements contained herein.

our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 35% (based on the closing price of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock on december 31, 2022 of $100.27). for this purpose, our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust, inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), plus the liquidation value of digital realty trust, inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of our operating partnership's units not held by digital realty trust, inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, class c units and class d units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.
the variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various one-month sofr, euribor, sora, bbr, hibor, tibor, base cd rate and cdor rates, depending on the respective agreement governing the debt, including our global revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loans. as of december 31, 2022 our debt had a weighted average term to initial maturity of approximately 5.2 years (or approximately 5.3 years assuming exercise of extension options).

(iii)   an increase in cash used for repayment of unsecured notes (in 2022, we redeemed the 4.750% notes due 2025 ($450 million); in 2021, we redeemed 2.750% notes due 2023 ($300 million) and paid down the remaining balance of our unsecured term loan ($537 million));

(iv)   an increase in dividend and distribution payments due to an increased dividend amount per share of common stock and common unit; and

(v)   an increase due to the settlement of forward sale agreements in july and december 2022, offset with the proceeds from the atm program in 2021.

noncontrolling interests in operating partnership noncontrolling interests relate to the common units in our operating partnership that are not owned by digital realty trust, inc., which, as of december 31, 2022, amounted to 2.1% of our operating partnership common units. historically, our operating partnership has issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties.
limited partners have the right to require our operating partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock at the time of the redemption. alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 0.2 million common units of the operating partnership that were issued to certain former unitholders of dupont fabros technology, l.p. in connection with the company's acquisition of dupont fabros technology, inc. were outstanding, which are subject to certain restrictions and, accordingly, are not presented as permanent capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
inflation many of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. in addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. a period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our global revolving credit facilities, borrowings under our unsecured term loans and issuances of unsecured senior notes.
in addition, refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion about risks that inflation directly or indirectly may pose to our business.

index to financial statements critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that involves management's use of judgement regarding expected outcomes of uncertain events in order to make estimates and assumptions that are material to an entity's financial condition and results of operations. though we base our estimates and assumptions regarding these matters on historical and current conditions as well as future expectations, these estimates and assumptions are subjective in nature. changes to the estimates and assumptions we make regarding these matters could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in the evaluation of our performance. of the significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the subsequent items have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies. refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.
fair value measurements. fair value is intended to reflect the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). we use fair value measurements to enable us to determine the fair value of a variety of items. fair value measurements are most significant to our financial statements in the following areas: 1) evaluation of recoverability of real estate and intangible assets (which involves comparison of fair value of the assets to net book value to quantify any potential impairments), 2) accounting for assets held for sale (which involves recording assets qualifying for held for sale treatment at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell), and 3) determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations or asset acquisitions as well as certain equity interests in unconsolidated entities.
we estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methods we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. given the significant amount of judgement and subjectivity involved in the determination of fair value, estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be realized on disposition. refer to note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
recoverability of real estate assets. we assess the carrying value of our properties whenever events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable ("triggering events"). triggering events typically relate to a change in the expected holding period of a property, an adverse change in expected future cash flows of the property, or a trend of past cash flow losses that is expected to continue in the future. if our assessment of triggering events indicates the carrying value of a property or asset group might not be recoverable, we estimate the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and compare that amount to the book value of the assets. if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates we are unable to recover the carrying value of a property or asset group, we record an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the property or asset group exceeds fair value. refer to note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
consolidation. we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned as well as all partially-owned entities that we control. in addition, we consolidate any variable interest entities ("vies") for which we are the primary beneficiary. we evaluate whether or not an entity is a vie (and we are the primary beneficiary) through consideration of substantive terms in the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses/receive benefits from the entity.
74
index to financial statements for entities that do not meet the definition of vies, we first consider if we are the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in investments not structured as partnerships). we consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners do not have rights that would preclude control. for entities in which we are the general partner, but the limited partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights that prohibit our ability to control the entity, we apply the equity method of accounting since, as the general partner, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entities. for entities in which we are a limited partner, or that are not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. when factors indicate we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, we consolidate the entity. refer to note 8. "investments in unconsolidated entities" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
revenue recognition. we generate the majority of our revenue by leasing our properties to customers under operating lease agreements, which are accounted for under accounting standards codification 842, leases ("asc 842"). we recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term if we determine it is probable that substantially all of the lease payments will be collected over the lease term.
we estimate the probability of collection of lease payments based on customer creditworthiness, outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical bad debts - as well as current economic trends. if collection of substantially all lease payments over the lease term is not probable, rental revenue is recognized when payment is received, and we record a full valuation allowance on the balance of any rent receivable, less the balance of any security deposits or letters of credit. if collection is subsequently determined to be probable, we: 1) resume recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis, 2) record incremental revenue such that the cumulative amount recognized is equal to the amount that would have been recorded on a straight-line basis since inception of the lease, and 3) reverse the allowance for bad debt recorded on outstanding receivables. refer to note 5. "receivables" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" of the consolidated financial statements.
funds from operations we calculate funds from operations, or ffo, in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts (nareit) in the nareit funds from operations white paper - 2018 restatement. ffo represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, a gain from a pre-existing relationship, impairment charges and real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. we also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits, ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits. however, because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited. other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and, accordingly, our ffo may not be comparable to other reits' ffo. ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries.
we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.
we have two reporting segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services (dms), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment is typically a lower-margin but high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, computing and storage, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale and printing industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment is typically a higher-margin business and includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
26
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
see note 13  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
in september 2017, our operations in cayey, puerto rico received significant hurricane damage. while we are still assessing the impact to our operations, we anticipate asset impairments and costs associated with business interruptions during the first half of fiscal year 2018. we also expect that the majority of these costs will ultimately be offset by insurance coverage.
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2017 increased approximately 3.9% to $19.1 billion compared to $18.4 billion for fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, and new business from existing customers in our healthcare and mobility businesses.

(1)   the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.

(2)   during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity.

(3)   during the three months ended february 28, 2017, days in inventory increased as compared to the prior sequential quarter: (i) as a result of lower production in the dms segment due to reduced consumer demand in the mobility business and (ii) to support expected revenue levels in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.

(4)                     during the three months ended august 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended may 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended august 31, 2016, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases and higher materials purchases during the quarter.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these
28
estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer. we recognize manufacturing services revenue when such tangible components are shipped to or the goods are received by the customer, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. upfront payments from customers are recorded upon receipt as deferred income and are recognized as revenue as the related manufacturing services are provided.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances after considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates.
29
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $27.5 million related to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. the companys assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including, among other recent evidence, historical cumulative operating income, projected future taxable income and recent utilization of non-u.s. tax credit carryforwards.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report (rar) on may 27, 2015, which was updated on june 22, 2016. the irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and issued an rar on april 19, 2017. the proposed adjustments in the rar from both examination periods relate primarily to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payments due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and fiscal years 2012 through 2014 would be approximately $28.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2014. also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties that are significantly higher than the amounts accrued for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. however, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements.

the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016
net revenue. net revenue increased 3.9% to $19.1 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the dms segment revenues increased 9% as a result of a 4% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies business, a 3% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our healthcare business and a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our mobility business. ems segment revenues remained relatively consistent due to a mix of increases and decreases spread across various industries within the ems segment, with no one change being significant individually.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary and other conditions, such as the less than anticipated product demand that we have experienced in our mobility business; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2017               2016                2015
ems              58   %              60   %              60   %

total           100   %             100   %             100   %
foreign source revenue represented 91.4% and 90.7%, respectively, of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent on an absolute basis and as a percent of revenue at $1.5 billion (8.1% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $907.7 million (4.8% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease resulted primarily from a $21.0 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2017 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary and salary-related expenses and other costs.
research and development. research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $29.7 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles decreased to $35.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the decrease is due to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during fiscal year 2016.

charges(1)
(1)          includes $51.3 million and $10.7 million recorded in the ems segment, $82.4 million and $0.8 million recorded in the dms segment and $26.7 million and $(0.1) million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.

(2)   includes employee severance and benefit costs of $52.2 million and $4.6 million, lease costs of $4.0 million and $0.0 million, asset write-off costs of $94.2 million and $0.1 million and other related costs of $3.8
million and $1.5 million for the 2017 restructuring plan and the 2013 restructuring plan, respectively, which are discussed in greater detail below.

(3)   costs relate to the restructuring plan approved by the board of directors in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013 restructuring plan) which was intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses.

2017 restructuring plan on september 15, 2016, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. this action includes headcount reductions across our selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 restructuring plan).
upon completion of the 2017 restructuring plan, we expect to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and related charges. we incurred $154.2 million of costs during fiscal year 2017 and anticipate incurring the remaining costs during fiscal year 2018 for employee severance and benefits costs, asset write-off costs and other related costs.
the 2017 restructuring plan, once complete, is expected to yield annualized cost savings beginning in fiscal year 2019 in the range of $70.0 million to $90.0 million. during fiscal year 2017, we realized costs savings of $25.0 million. the annual cost savings is expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense.   2013 restructuring plan as of august 31, 2017, the 2013 restructuring plan was substantially complete.
see note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restructuring and related charges for the 2017 and 2013 restructuring plans.
other expense. other expense increased to $28.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 compared to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the increase is primarily due to an other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of $11.5 million, an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs and a loss associated with a cost method investment.
interest income. interest income increased to $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 due to increased investments.
interest expense. interest expense remained relatively consistent at $138.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 50.4% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, compared to an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to decreased income in jurisdictions with low tax rates and increased losses in jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances, which was partially due to an increase in restructuring expense, and increased income in jurisdictions with high tax rates. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by an income tax benefit of $27.5 million for the reversal of valuation allowances related to non-u.s. jurisdictions.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2015
net revenue. net revenue increased 2.5% to $18.4 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. specifically, the dms segment revenues increased 3% due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand during the first half of fiscal year 2016. ems segment revenues increased 2% due to a 3% increase in revenues from new business with existing customers within our telecommunications business, partially offset by a 1% revenue decline spread across the remaining industries within the ems segment.
foreign source revenue represented 90.7% and 88.0%, respectively, of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015.
gross profit. gross profit remained relatively consistent at $1.5 billion (8.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $924.4 million (5.0% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2016 compared to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent with the same period of the prior fiscal year. selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in salary and salary-related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business.
33
research and development. research and development expenses increased to $32.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, primarily as the result of new projects in targeted growth sectors.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles increased to $37.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 as compared to $24.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase is due to the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the plasticos acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisitions of shemer, inala and hanson that occurred during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016, respectively.
restructuring and related charges.
2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $11.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $34.6 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2016 and 2015 include cash costs of $8.8 million and $24.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.0 million and $2.8 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1.9 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $1.2 million and $5.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to note 15  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements.
other expense. other expense increased to $8.4 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 compared to $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs as a result of an increase in receivables sold.
interest income. interest income remained relatively consistent at $9.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $10.0 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015.
interest expense. interest expense increased to $136.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to $128.1 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the increase was due to interest expense associated with the term loan facility entered into on july 6, 2015, (see note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements).
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 34.1% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016, compared to an effective tax rate of 31.8% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions and the increase in losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2016. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by tax benefits from favorable tax audit resolutions and statute of limitation expirations in non-u.s. jurisdictions during fiscal year 2016.
non-u.s. gaap (core) financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s. gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, other than temporary impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.
34
we determine the tax effect of the items excluded from core earnings and core basic and diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. in certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a 0% tax rate is applied.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-u.s. gaap financial measures.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 and three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2016. acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition.
seasonality production levels for a portion of the dms segment are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter which ends on november 30, due to higher demand for consumer-related products during the holiday selling season.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, share repurchases, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $841.1 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
during fiscal year 2017, we repatriated $225.9 million of current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations, which did not result in tax expense due to a current year operating loss and valuation allowance in the u.s. as of august 31, 2017, we intend to repatriate pre-acquisition undistributed earnings of $188.5 million related to nypro and a portion of our remaining current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations from cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. in connection with this future repatriation of earnings, we have a deferred tax liability of approximately $86.2 million at august 31, 2017. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries outside the u.s.

(1)   we believe that our cash on hand and available borrowing under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund the payment of the 8.250% senior notes. however, we anticipate that we will enter into a new borrowing agreement to repay our 8.250% senior notes prior to maturity.

(2)           on july 6, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement. the credit agreement provides for: (i) the revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.5 billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, be increased to $2.0 billion and (ii) a $500.0 million five-year delayed draw term loan facility, (collectively the credit facility). both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility expire on july 6, 2020. the revolving credit facility is subject to two whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion.

as of august 31, 2017, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the interest rate on the term loan facility was 2.6%. interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either 0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to 1.000% above the base rate or 1.125% to 2.000% above the eurocurrency rate. the base rate represents the greatest of: (i) citibank, n.a.s base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0% above one-month libor, but not less than zero. the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero.
as of august 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries have various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. the foreign subsidiary credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 1.2% to 3.5%.
as of august 31, 2017, we had $1.9 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common stock.
(3)   in addition to the term loan facility described above, as of august 31, 2017, we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs. these additional loans are approximately $2.1 million and have interest rates ranging from 0.0% to 10.0%.

39
currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. the current shelf registration statement expires in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we expect to file a new registration statement prior to its expiration.
our senior notes and our credit facility contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our senior notes and credit facility. refer to note 9  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
asset-backed securitization and trade accounts receivable sale programs asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to: (i) conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions and (ii) an unaffiliated financial institution. any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected.
following is a summary of our asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:

(1)   maximum amount available at any one time.

(2)   on october 18, 2017, the program was extended to november 17, 2017.

in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, as of august 31, 2017, we sold $1.2 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $590.9 million and recorded a deferred purchase price receivable of $568.7 million. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $11.1 million in available liquidity under our asset-backed securitization programs.
our asset-backed securitization programs contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under our asset-backed securitization programs. refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.

(3)   any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.

during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, we sold $3.0 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $3.0 billion. as of august 31, 2017, we had up to $613.7 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.
capital expenditures we currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our net capital expenditures, which do not include any amounts spent on acquisitions, will be approximately $700.0 million, principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments.

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 resulted primarily from net income, an increase in non-cash expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business, advance deposits from customers and the timing of purchases and cash payments. the increase in inventories supports expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and also is due to increased demand. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of sales and cash collections activity as well as higher sales levels.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017 consisted primarily of: (i) capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments and (ii) cash paid for the acquisition of lewis engineering, including certain intangible assets, net of cash received, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock and (iii) dividend payments. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors (the board) each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, our board authorized the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common stock during the twelve-month period following the authorization (the 2015 share repurchase program). during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for approximately $54.5 million, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding under the 2015 share repurchase program.
in june 2016, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our common stock (the 2016 share repurchase program). as of august 31, 2017, $400.0 million of shares had been repurchased under the 2016 share repurchase program, which utilized the total amount authorized by the board.
in july 2017, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of our common stock (the 2017 share repurchase program). the 2017 share repurchase program expires on august 31, 2018. as of october 10, 2017, $32.9 million of shares had been repurchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of august 31, 2017 are summarized below. as disclosed below, while we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks, at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

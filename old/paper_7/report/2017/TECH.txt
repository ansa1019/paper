in fiscal 2017, biotechnology segment net sales increased 15% compared to fiscal 2016. organic growth for the segment was 4% for the fiscal year, with acquisitions contributing 13% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. antibody and assay product categories drove growth. the growth in antibodies was led by double-digit growth in the novus brand. the growth in assays was by luminex-based products the company makes and sells and royalties received from luminex assay suppliers who use the company's content in the production of their assays.
in fiscal 2017, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2016. organic growth for the segment was 19% with acquisitions contributing 1% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. growth was broad-based and led by additional market demand for simple western (wes) instruments and consumables, and the simple plex (ella) and biologics (maurice) product lines.
in fiscal 2017, diagnostics segment net sales increased 3% compared to fiscal 2016. all results for fiscal 2017 are organic. timing of oem orders had a negative impact on fiscal 2017 results. mid-single digit sales growth in blood and glucose-based controls was partially offset by the timing of oem shipments from the diagnostic assay and reagent product lines.
in fiscal 2016, biotechnology segment net sales increased 3% compared to fiscal 2015. organic growth for the segment was 6% for the fiscal year, with foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 3%. we grew in all major geographies, most notably in china and from biopharma customers in the u.s. and europe. japan was the only notable exception, where demand was weak due to delayed funding from japanese government agencies.

in fiscal 2016, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 17% compared to fiscal 2015. organic growth for the segment was 14% with acquisitions contributing 5% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. additional market demand for simple western instruments and consumables, a new instrument product launch in the biologics (maurice) product line, and simple plex (ella) instrument and consumable sales, the elisa-multiplexing solution that was the key technology acquired as part of the cyvek acquisition in fiscal 2015, all drove growth in this segment. there was no revenue from the zephyrus acquisition in fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2016, diagnostics segment net sales increased 34% compared to fiscal 2015. included in fiscal 2016 diagnostics segment net sales was $26.6 million generated by the acquisition of cliniqa in july 2015, contributing essentially all of the growth. solid organic growth in the hematology controls product line was offset by customer delayed projects in the glucose controls product line due to reimbursement pricing pressures in that particular market segment.
gross margins consolidated gross margins were 67%, 67% and 68% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 71%, 71% and 72% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:
year ended june 30,

2017              2016              2015
consolidated gross margin percentage                      66.5   %          67.5   %          67.9   %
identified adjustments:
costs recognized upon sale of acquired inventory           0.6   %           1.1   %           1.5   %
amortization of intangibles                                4.1   %           2.2   %           2.2   %
adjusted gross margin percentage                          71.2   %          70.8   %          71.6   %
fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. in fiscal 2017, the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2016, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of acd. in fiscal 2016, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2015, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of cliniqa. in fiscal 2015, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2014, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisitions of novus, proteinsimple, and cyvek. we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company's three business segments. since these results are used for this purpose, they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap. segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,

2017              2016              2015

protein platforms                                      67.6   %          67.8   %          66.9   %
diagnostics                                            42.3   %          44.8   %          42.7   %
consolidated adjusted gross margin percentage          71.2   %          70.8   %          71.6   %
the biotechnology segment and the protein platforms segment gross margin percentage improvements for fiscal 2017 and 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to higher volume leverage and operational productivity.
the diagnostics segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by lower volume leverage and margin mix of product sales. increased operational productivity in fiscal 2016 increased margins compared to fiscal 2015

selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased $59.6 million (42%) and $21.5 million (18%) in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the increase in fiscal 2017 was driven by additional expenses associated with the space, acd and zephyrus acquisitions including $21.1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses, a $3.2 million increase in acquisition intangible amortization, a $18.4 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration and a $4.3 million increase in other acquisition related costs. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to additional investments in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, including increased stock compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefit increases.
the increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily from $5.4 million added as a result of the cliniqa acquisition, including $3.4 million of increased costs associated with stock based compensation. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 included investments made in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, stock compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefits increases.

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and non-gaap tax rate applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments for the year ended june 30, 2017 is primarily a result of the revaluation of contingent consideration. the company recorded acquisition related expense of $18.4 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration, which is not tax deductible.
liquidity and capital resources cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2017 were $157.7 million compared to $95.8 million at june 30, 2016. included in available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016 was the fair value of the company's investment in ccxi of $59.6 million and $28.6 million, respectively.
at june 30, 2017, approximately 42% of the company's cash and equivalent account balances of $91.6 million were located in the u.s., with the remainder located in canada, china, the u.k. and other european countries.
at june 30, 2017, approximately 93% of the company's available-for-sale investment account balances of $66.1 million were located in the u.s., with the remaining 7% in china.
the company has either paid u.s. taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings or intends to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings in the foreign operations or expects the earnings will be remitted in a tax neutral transaction. management of the company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available funds, including funds available through our line-of-credit and cash generated from operations.
during fiscal 2017, the company acquired space and acd for approximately $9.0 million and $258.0 million, respectively. the acquisitions were financed through a combination of cash on hand and our revolving line of credit facility that the company obtained prior to the closing of the acd acquisition. the acd acquisition also included certain future contingent payments of up to $75.0 million due upon the achievement of certain revenue milestones. additionally, the company made a $40.0 million equity investment in astute medical, inc.
during fiscal 2016, the company acquired cliniqa and zephyrus for approximately $82.9 million and $8.0 million, respectively. these acquisitions were financed with a combination of cash on hand and our revolving line of credit facility. the zephyrus acquisition consisted of a net cash payment of $8.0 million and certain future contingent payments of up to $7.0 million, with a current fair value of $3.3 million.
25
during fiscal 2015, the company acquired novus biologicals, proteinsimple, and cyvek for approximately $60.1 million, $300.0 million and $94.9 million, respectively. the novus acquisition was financed through cash on hand. the purchases of proteinsimple and cyvek were financed through cash on hand and our revolving line of credit facility.
our $400 million line-of-credit facility was modified in july 2016 in connection with the acquisition of acd. the senior unsecured revolving credit facility has a term of five years with an adjustable interest rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime commercial rate, (ii) the per annum federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (iii) libor + 1.00% - 1.75% depending on the existing total leverage ratio of debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility). the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of ebit to cash interest expense, of 3.0x and a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.5x. the annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is variable based upon the company's leverage ratio at each pricing date.
future acquisition strategies may or may not require additional borrowings under the line-of-credit facility or other outside sources of funding.
cash flows from operating activities the company generated cash from operations of $143.8 million, $143.9 million, and $139.8 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 were mainly the result of an increase in net earnings after adjusting for non-cash expenses related to depreciation, amortization, costs recognized on sale of acquired inventory, and stock based compensation expense.
cash flows from investing activities we continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures. cash paid for acquisitions was incrementally higher in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, with net cash paid of $253.8 million for the acd and space acquisitions compared to $91.4 million for the cliniqa and zephyrus acquisitions during fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2015, the company paid net cash of $420.1 million for the cyvek, proteinsimple and novus acquisitions.
in addition to the acd and space acquisitions in fiscal 2017, the company also invested $40.0 million in astute medical, inc. during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
the company's net proceeds from the purchase, sale and maturity of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3.0 million, $0.8 million, and $13.5 million, respectively. the company's investment policy is to place excess cash in municipal and corporate bonds with the objective of obtaining the highest possible return while minimizing risk and keeping the funds accessible.
capital additions in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $15.2 million, $16.9 million, and $19.9 million. capital additions planned for fiscal 2018 are approximately $23.8 million and are expected to be financed through currently available cash and cash generated from operations.
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, the company paid cash dividends of $47.3 million $47.6 million, and $47.1 million, respectively. the board of directors periodically considers the payment of cash dividends.
the company received $5.3 million, $5.4 million, and $9.7 million, for the exercise of options for 63,000, 69,000, and 241,000, shares of common stock in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company recognized excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $0.5 million $0.6 million, $0.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

during fiscal 2017, the company drew $368.5 million under its revolving line-of-credit facility to partially fund its acquisition of acd and investment in astute. the company made payments on the line-of-credit and other debt of $116.5 million.
during fiscal 2016, the company drew $77.0 million under its revolving line-of-credit facility to partially fund its acquisitions of cliniqa. the company made payments on the line-of-credit and other debt of $58.5 million.
during fiscal 2015, the company drew $163.0 million under its revolving line-of-credit facility to partially fund its acquisitions of proteinsimple and cyvek. the company made payments on the line-of-credit and other debt of $95.0 million.
during fiscal 2017, the company determined that certain sales and revenue thresholds were met for zephyrus and acd. cash payments totaling $28.5 million ($3.5 million for zephyrus and $25 million for acd) were made during the third quarter. of the $28.5 million of total payments, $16.7 million is classified as financing. the financing component represents the portion of the total liability that was recognized at the acquisition date. the remaining $11.8 million is recorded as operating as it represents the consideration liability that exceed the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date during fiscal 2017, the company made payments of $3.6 million to settle outstanding consideration payables related to the primegene acquisition.
in april 2009, the board of directors authorized a plan for the repurchase and retirement of $60.0 million of its common stock. in october 2012, the board of directors increased the amount authorized under the plan by $100.0 million. the plan does not have an expiration date. in fiscal 2013, the company purchased and retired 28,000 and shares of common stock at market values of $1.8 million. there were no stock repurchases in fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 or 2014. at june 30, 2017, approximately $125.0 million remained available for purchase under the above authorizations.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or obligations that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the company's financial condition, changes in the financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

critical accounting policies management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. the calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company's business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. we may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.
the fair value of acquired technology is estimated, at times, using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. the fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquirees. the fair value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings. we generally estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. this valuation model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as a brand name or fixed assets, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. the resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the customer list asset, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. the fair value of acquired customer relationships may also be estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. assumptions used in these calculations include same-customer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees' historical information.
we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. assumptions used in these calculations include discount rates, projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.
28
the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. for example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. as goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill goodwill was $579.0 million as of june 30, 2017, which represented 37% of total assets. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.
to analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.
2017 goodwill impairment analysis in completing our 2017 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units. a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit, which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. in accordance with asu 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. in determining the fair values of our reporting units, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit's financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. the discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we were required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. because our 2017 quantitative analysis included all of our reporting units, the summation of our reporting units' fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value, as indicated by our market capitalization, to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations.
the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30, 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom. this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows, as well as our selected discount rate. changes in the reporting unit's results, forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units.
29
2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment analysis the company used a qualitative test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 with one exception. the company elected to utilize a quantitative test for the protein platforms reporting unit for fiscal year 2016 using the previously described income approach given that this was a newer reporting unit created primarily through acquisitions. the qualitative analyses for our other reporting units completed during 2016 and 2015 evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. in completing these assessments, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. based on the testing performed for the protein platforms reporting unit, fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial amount and no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary.
there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1, 2002.
amortizable intangible assets we periodically review our amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $452.0 million and $310.5 million as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
new accounting pronouncements information regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2017 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption "note 1: description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appear in item 8 of this report.
subsequent events in july 2017, management determined that cyvek achieved the required revenue threshold for the additional consideration payment discussed in note 4 resulting in a payment of $34.0 million to the former owners.
on september 5, 2017, bio-techne acquired trevigen inc for approximately $11.0 million. the purchase accounting for this acquisition is in progress.
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k, including "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). these non-gaap measures include:
●   adjusted gross margin

●   adjusted net earnings

●   adjusted net earnings growth

●   adjusted effective tax rate

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
30
our non-gaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin and adjusted net earnings exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related expenses. the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses, from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity.
the company's non-gaap adjusted net earnings also excludes stock based compensation expense and certain adjustments to income tax expense. stock based compensation is excluded from non-gaap adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. the company independently calculates a non-gaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. in addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. we believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.
the company periodically reassesses the components of our non-gaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.

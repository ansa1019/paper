item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in item 1a. risk factors. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. see "special note regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors.
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as "towers" or "sites." our principal operations are in the united states and its territories. in addition, we own and operate towers in south america, central america, and canada. our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.7% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2017. in our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. as of december 31, 2017, we owned 27,909 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. we also managed or leased approximately 9,000 actual or potential towers, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31, 2017. our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.
site leasing services our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the united states, canada, central america, and south america. as of december 31, 2017, (1) no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and (2) no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017. in addition, as of december 31, 2017, approximately 30.1% of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 3% of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets (each country is considered a market). we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including at&t, t-mobile, verizon wireless, sprint, oi s.a., telefonica, claro, and tim. wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site. in the united states and canada, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods. in central america, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index. site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent.
in our central american markets and ecuador, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in u.s. dollars. specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are due and paid in u.s. dollars. in our central american markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. in brazil, canada, chile, and colombia, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. in argentina and peru, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and u.s. dollars.
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:
•rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;
•straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests;
•property taxes;
27
•site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);
•utilities;
•property insurance; and
•deferred lease origination cost amortization.
ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, or in our south american markets, adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 70% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. for any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. as such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.
as indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. for information regarding our operating segments, see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology. we believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. during 2018, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2017 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum and spectrum acquired during auctions completed in 2017. we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology (e.g. iden, metropcs, clearwire, and cricket).
site development services our site development business, which is conducted in the united states only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. the market offices are responsible for all site development operations.

capital allocation strategy our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value. a primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our adjusted funds from operations per share. to achieve this, we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases, subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements, available funds and market conditions, while maintaining our target leverage levels. key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:
portfolio growth. we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers.
stock repurchase program. we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below intrinsic value. we believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, with no need for management's judgment in their application. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017, included herein. our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.  revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five to ten years. receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered. for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis, site development billing (and revenue recognition) is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis. upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis, we recognize the revenue related to that phase. site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete. amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets.
revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management's estimated total cost for each contract. this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. these amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. the asset "costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts" represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. the liability "billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts," included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.
29
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable.
asset impairment we evaluate individual long-lived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed. we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists. we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present. we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment.
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired, such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible. if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible, we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value. we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value. estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, historical operating results, geographic location, lease-up potential, and expected timing of lease-up. in addition, we make certain assumptions in determining an asset's fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge.
acquisitions in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business. asu 2017-01 provides revised guidance to determine when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or when the acquisition should be accounted for as an asset acquisition. we adopted this standard effective january 1, 2017 and all changes will be accounted for prospectively. the adoption of asu 2017-01 did not have a material impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
under the new standard, our acquisitions will generally qualify for asset acquisition treatment under asc 360, property, plant, and equipment, rather than business combination treatment under asc 805 business combinations. for acquisitions which qualify as asset acquisitions, the aggregate purchase price is allocated on a relative fair value basis to towers and related intangible assets. for asset acquisitions, external, direct transaction costs will be capitalized as a component of the cost of the asset acquired. we will continue to expense internal acquisition costs as incurred.
we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those from the dates of the respective acquisitions. we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date.
the fair values of net assets acquired are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management at the time. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods.
the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date ("current contract intangibles") and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the towers ("network location intangibles") and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows. the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets, which is typically 15 years.
in connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to pay contingent consideration (or earnouts) in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired. contingent consideration in connection with asset acquisitions will be recognized at the time when the contingency is resolved or becomes payable and will increase the cost basis of the assets acquired. we accrue for contingent
30
consideration in connection with business combinations at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable in cash are recorded through consolidated statements of operations.

results of operations this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.  year ended 2017 compared to year ended 2016

revenues domestic site leasing revenues increased $34.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, due largely to (i) revenues from 438 towers acquired and 97 towers built since january 1, 2016 and (ii) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments for additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators, partially offset by lease non-renewals primarily by metropcs, clearwire, and cricket.
international site leasing revenues increased $50.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing revenues increased $33.2 million. these changes were primarily due to (i) revenues from 1,518 towers acquired and 739 towers built since january 1, 2016, (ii) organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual escalators, and (iii) an increase in reimbursable pass-through expenses. site leasing revenue in brazil represented 13.4% of total site leasing revenue for the period.  no other individual international market represented more than 3% of our total site leasing revenue.
site development revenues increased $9.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to prior year, as a result of increased carrier activity.
operating profit domestic site leasing segment operating profit increased $34.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional profit generated by (i) towers acquired and built since january 1, 2016 and organic site

interest income increased $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, interest income decreased $0.3 million. these changes were primarily due to a lower average interest rate offset by a higher amount of interest bearing deposits held in brazil as compared to the prior year.
interest expense decreased $5.4 million, on an actual and constant currency basis, for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, due to the lower weighted average interest rate on debt, partially offset by a higher average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding as compared to the prior year. the decrease primarily resulted from the repayment of the 2010-2c tower securities in july 2016, the 5.75% senior notes in august 2016, the 5.625% senior notes in october 2016, and

non-cash interest expense increased $0.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the amortization of the discount related to the 2016 senior notes (defined below) issued in august 2016.
amortization of deferred financing fees increased $0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the issuance of the 2017-1c tower securities in april 2017, the 2016-1c tower securities in july 2016, the 2016 senior notes in august 2016, and the 2017 senior notes in october 2017, partially offset by the repayment of the 2010-2c tower securities in july 2016, the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017, the 5.75% senior notes in august 2016, and the 5.625% senior notes in october 2016.
loss from extinguishment of debt was $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the write-off of unamortized financing costs associated with the repayment of the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017.  loss from the extinguishment of debt was $52.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 due to the payment of a $25.8 million call premium and the write-off of $7.7 million in deferred financing fees on the redemption of the 5.75% senior notes, the payment of a $14.1 million call premium and the write-off of $4.1 million in deferred financing fees on the redemption of the 5.625% senior notes, and the write-off of $1.0 million in deferred financing fees related to redemption of the 2010-2c tower securities.    other income (expense), net includes an $8.8 million loss on the remeasurement of a u.s. dollar denominated intercompany loan with a brazilian subsidiary for the year ended december 31, 2017, while the prior year included a $90.0 million gain.    provision for income taxes:

revenues domestic site leasing revenues increased $37.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year, due largely to (i) revenues from 951 towers acquired and 183 towers built since january 1, 2015 and (ii) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments for additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators, partially offset by non-lease renewals in 2015 primarily related to carrier consolidation, including sprint's iden network, which impacted our year-over-year growth rates during 2016.
international site leasing revenues increased $20.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing revenues increased $30.6 million. these changes were due largely to (i) revenues from 473 towers acquired and 640 towers built since january 1, 2015, (ii) organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators, and (iii) an increase in reimbursable pass-through expenses. site leasing revenue in brazil represented 11.6% of total site leasing revenue for the period. no other individual international market represented more than 3% of our total site leasing revenue.
site development revenues decreased $62.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year, as a result of a decrease in the volume of work performed, particularly as it related to sprint.
operating profit domestic site leasing segment operating profit increased $28.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional profit generated by (i) towers acquired and built since january 1, 2015 and organic site leasing growth as noted above, (ii) improving control of our site leasing cost of revenue, and (iii) the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.
international site leasing segment operating profit increased $11.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing segment operating profit increased $17.9 million. these changes were primarily due to towers acquired and built since january 1, 2015 and organic site leasing growth as noted above, partially offset by increases in cost of revenues.

non-gaap financial measures this report contains information regarding a non-gaap measure, adjusted ebitda. we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda, a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016. we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. in addition, we believe that excluding the oi reserve, which represents a $16.5 million one-time provision for doubtful accounts recorded in the prior year, provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a non-recurring event.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2014 senior notes, 2016 senior notes, and 2017 senior notes. adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance.

46
not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. the senior credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of sba senior finance ii and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. the senior credit agreement is also subject to customary events of default. pursuant to the second amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement, amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility, the term loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by sba senior finance ii or the subsidiary guarantors (as defined in the senior credit agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the membership interests of sba telecommunications, llc, sba senior finance, llc and sba senior finance ii and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of sba senior finance ii and the subsidiary guarantors.
the senior credit agreement, as amended, permits sba senior finance ii, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide sba senior finance ii with increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in revolving credit facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda would not exceed 6.5 times. sba senior finance ii's ability to request such increases in the revolving credit facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the senior credit agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the senior credit agreement. upon sba senior finance ii's request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide sba senior finance ii with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms.

secured tower revenue securities tower revenue securities terms the mortgage loan underlying the 2012-1c tower securities, 2013 tower securities, 2014 tower securities, 2015-1c tower securities, 2016-1c tower securities, and 2017-1c tower securities (together the "tower securities") will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 10,442 tower sites owned by the borrowers. the sole asset of the trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of those entities that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the "borrowers"). the mortgage loan is secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (ii) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the borrowers' personal property and fixtures, (iii) the borrowers' rights under certain tenant leases, and (iv) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. for each calendar month, sba network management, inc., an indirect subsidiary ("network management"), is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the borrowers' operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.
the borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (i) within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2012-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1d, secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2016-1c and secured tower revenue securities 2017-1c) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (ii) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the borrowers or (iii) during an amortization period. in all other circumstances, the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. the prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the tower securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2012-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2013-1d, secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2016-1c, and tower revenue securities 2017-1c) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue
48
securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.
to the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (i) 5% and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.
pursuant to the terms of the tower securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. the monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as short-term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets (see note 4). however, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as "excess cash flow," will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an "amortization period" will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. in addition, if any of the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the tower securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the tower securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to network management, fourth to repay principal of the tower securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. furthermore, the advance rents reserve requirement states that the borrowers are required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant debt service coverage ratio is equal to or less than 2:1 and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1. the mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. among other things, the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets.
as of december 31, 2017, the borrowers met the debt service coverage ratio required by the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants as set forth in the agreement.

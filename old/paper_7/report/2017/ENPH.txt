item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties. in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "intend," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. for example, statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance, expense levels and liquidity sources are forward-looking statements. our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.
overview we deliver simple, innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy. we were founded in march 2006 and are a market leader in the microinverter category of the u.s inverter market. our technology was designed to increase energy production, simplify design and installation, improve system uptime and reliability, reduce fire risk, and provide a platform for intelligent energy management. since inception, we have shipped more than 16 million microinverters, representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic (pv) generating capacity, and more than 739,000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 110 countries.
we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and strategic partners. historically, revenues generated from the u.s. market have represented 70%-80% of our total revenue.
our first commercial shipment occurred in mid-2008. our net revenues were $286.2 million, $322.6 million and $357.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we incurred net losses of $45.2 million, $67.5 million and $22.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we had $29.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $38.7 million.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $29.1 million in cash, as compared to $17.8 million as of december 31, 2016. in february 2018 we raised an additional $20.0 million through a private placement of common stock and also reached an agreement with our lender to defer approximately 50% of the principal payments due in 2018 under our term loans. the amount deferred in 2018 will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan. see notes 10. "debt" and 19. "subsequent events" to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
management has considered the above factors and has concluded that substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists at the time of filing of this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017.
components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems and related accessories, which include microinverter units, ac battery storage systems, an envoy communications gateway, and our enlighten cloud-based monitoring service.
our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
34
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. we contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states, europe and asia.
gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost, product mix, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, recruiting costs, sales commissions, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation.
research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses such as salaries, commissions, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and travel. it also includes trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states, canada, mexico and certain central american markets, the united kingdom, france, the benelux region, certain other european markets, australia, new zealand, india and certain other asian markets. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services, which consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
restructuring charges are the net of charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017 to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expense and gain on divestiture of our services business. costs included in restructuring primarily consist of severance for workforce reduction actions, non-cash charges related to the disposition of assets and impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves. see note 9, "restructuring and other charges" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
35
other expense, net other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility, term loans, and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs. other expense, net also includes interest income and gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into u.s. dollars.
provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states, we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. due to the history of losses we have generated in the united states since inception, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that all of our u.s. and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31, 2017.

2017 compared to 2016. net revenues decreased by 11 % to $286.2 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. the number of microinverter units sold decreased by 6% to approximately 2.9 million units in 2017 in part due to our
36
efforts to improve gross margins, which included foregoing low-margin sales. net revenues decreased year-over-year primarily due to the lower volume combined with a decline in the average system selling price of approximately 5% in 2017 compared to 2016. the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by the recognition of $2.2 million of deferred revenue resulting from a change in estimate of the service period related to sales of our envoy product. we expect the average selling price per watt of microinverters to continue to decline.
2016 compared to 2015. net revenues decreased by 10% to $322.6 million in 2016, as compared to 2015. the number of microinverter units sold increased slightly in 2016 and was approximately 3.1 million units in both 2016 and 2015. net revenues decreased year-over-year primarily due to a decline in the average system selling price of approximately 13% in 2016 compared to 2015.

2017 compared to 2016. cost of revenues decreased by 13% in 2017, as compared to 2016, and was primarily attributable to the transition in 2017 to our next generation iq microinverters, which have a lower cost profile than the previous generation, as well as the decline in sales volume. gross margin increased by 1.6 percentage points to 19.6% in 2017, as compared to 18.0% in 2016. the primary drivers of the gross margin increase were lower warranty expense and logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the components of warranty expense.
2016 compared to 2015. cost of revenues increased by 6% in 2016, as compared to 2015, which was primarily attributable to a shift in product mix that resulted in increased sales of higher-priced accessories, including our ac battery storage system. gross margin decreased by 12.3 percentage points to 18.0% in 2016, as compared to 30.3% in 2015. while we experienced an overall reduction in our product costs, our adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin. in 2016, our gross margin also included the impact of higher warranty expense, as compared to 2015. the higher warranty expense in 2016 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates, which reduced gross margin by 1.2 percentage points. see note 7, "warranty obligations" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

2017 compared to 2016. research and development expenses decreased by $17.5 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated non-core projects resulting in an $11.5 million reduction in research and development personnel related expenses and a $5.9 million reduction in lab parts, product prototypes and professional fees. the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity. we do not expect it to see the same magnitude of reduction in expense in the future as most of the benefits of our operating expense reduction initiatives were realized in 2017.
37
2016 compared to 2015. research and development expenses decreased by $0.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily due to decreased compensation costs and depreciation expense as a result of the restructuring actions taken in september 2016. the decrease was partially offset by higher outside professional fees utilized to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products.

2017 compared to 2016. sales and marketing expenses decreased by $15.7 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative resulting in an $8.5 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a $1.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. bad debt expense was reduced by $2.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, and advertising and professional fees were reduced by $2.8 million. we do not expect to see the same magnitude of cost savings in sales and marketing expenses in the future as we realized most of the benefits by the end of 2017 of the cost savings initiatives we implemented.
2016 compared to 2015. sales and marketing expenses decreased by $7.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily due to an $8.4 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a $1.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. these decreases were partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in bad debt expense in 2016 and a $1.8 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisition-related contingent consideration liability that was recorded in 2015.

2017 compared to 2016. general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.2 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. the decrease is primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated non-core projects resulting in a $4.9 million reduction in general and administrative personnel related expenses, a $0.8 million reduction in facilities related expenses and a $1.0 million reduction in depreciation expense as a result of a lower fixed asset base. these decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounting and legal fees. we do not expect to see the same magnitude of cost savings in general and administrative expenses in the future as we realized most of the benefits by the end of 2017 of the cost savings initiatives we implemented.
2016 compared to 2015. general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of a $1.7 million reduction in compensation costs due to lower headcount, a $0.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and a $1.8 million reduction in professional services, which was primarily attributable to lower legal and other professional fees. this decrease was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in corporate expenses including rent, utilities and depreciation.

2017 compared to 2016. we implemented a restructuring plan in 2016 to lower operating expenses and cost of revenues that included reductions in our global workforce and the elimination of certain non-core projects. in 2017 we engaged a management consulting firm to assist us in making organizational and structural changes to improve operational efficiencies and reduce expenses. restructuring charges in 2017 include $12.1 million of consulting services, $2.8 million in cash-based severance and related benefits and $2.0 million in charges for asset impairments and lease loss reserves. although we will continue to make business and process improvements, our formal restructuring efforts were largely completed in 2017, and we do not expect to incur substantial additional restructuring charges in the near future.
2016 compared to 2015. in 2016 restructuring and other charges included $1.3 million of severance and other costs related to reduction in workforce, $2.6 million in asset impairments, $0.6 million lease loss reserves and contract termination costs and a gain of $0.6 million related to the disposition of our services business.

2017 compared to 2016. other expense increased by $2.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to a $5.2 million increase in net interest expense, which was partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in other income related to foreign exchange rates.
2016 compared to 2015. other expense increased $1.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher interest paid due to higher average outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2016 and interest paid on an additional $25 million of term debt that funded in july 2016.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2017, we had $29.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $38.7 million. cash and cash equivalents held in the united states was $20.8 million and consisted primarily of non-interest bearing checking deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. we consider amounts held outside the u.s. to be accessible and have provided for the estimated u.s. income tax liability associated with the potential repatriation our foreign earnings.
actions we have taken to improve our liquidity include restructuring our operations raising additional funds. the restructuring actions we have taken resulted in a $38.4 million reduction in ongoing operating expenses (excluding restructuring charges of $16.9 million and $3.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. in 2016, we completed a public
40
offering of 13,000,000 shares of our common stock. including the subsequent over-allotment, we sold approximately 15 million shares and realized net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million.
in december of 2016, we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement (atm) under which we sold shares of our common stock up to a gross aggregate offering price of $17.0 million. we realized the full $17.0 million of gross proceeds available under the atm in the first quarter of 2017.
in january 2017, we completed a private placement of common stock that resulted in gross proceeds of $10.0 million. in january 2018, we completed another private placement of common stock that resulted in additional gross proceeds of $20.0 million.
in july 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the "term loan agreement" or "original term loan agreement") with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners, llc ("tcp"), which has subsequently been amended and modified as discussed below and in notes 10, "debt" and 18, "subsequent events" to the consolidated financial statements. under the agreement, the lenders committed to advance a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million with a maturity date of july 1, 2020. we drew down the $25.0 million term loan commitment at closing.
payments under the original agreement were interest only through june 30, 2017, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on july 1, 2017 and continuing through the maturity date. in addition, we paid a commitment fee of 3.3% of the loan amount upon closing and a closing fee of 10.0% of the loan amount is payable in four equal installments at each anniversary of the closing date. we may elect to prepay the loan by incurring a prepayment fee between 1% and 3% of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing and circumstances of prepayment.
the term loan agreement is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on creation of liens, dispositions of assets, dividends, mergers, or changing the nature of its business, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions. in addition, the term loan agreement contains certain customary events of default including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest, principal and fees or other amounts when due, material breach of any representation or warranty, covenant defaults, cross defaults to other material indebtedness, events of bankruptcy and the occurrence of a material adverse change (as defined in the agreement) to our business. the term loan agreement offers tcp typical rights and remedies in any event of default, including the ability to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable. we do not expect the lender to declare default under any event, including the material adverse change clause.
in february 2017, we amended our loan and security agreement with tcp to provide an additional $25 million in principal (together with the term loan agreement the "combined term loans"). we simultaneously terminated our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank, n.a. (the "revolver"), and the combined principal and interest balance of $10.3 million was fully repaid.
the combined term loans have the same july 1, 2020 maturity date as the original tcp loan. monthly payments under the combined term loans are interest only through february 28, 2018, followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on march 1, 2018 and continuing through the maturity date. interest on the combined term loans is the greater of (a) 10.3125%, and (b) a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the three-month libor rate (rounded up to the nearest 1/16th of one percent) plus 9.25%.
in february 2018 the tcp loan was modified again to provide for the deferral of 50% of the scheduled principal payments in 2018. see notes 10, "debt" and 18, "subsequent events" to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the term loans under our amended loan and security agreement with tcp are secured by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our assets; provided, however, that the security interest in our intellectual property may be released when we satisfy certain requirements.

cash flows from operating activities for 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $28.4 million, primarily resulting from a net loss of $45.2 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $6.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $9.0 million, asset impairment and non-cash restructuring charges of $1.1 million, and a provision for doubtful accounts of $0.5 million. changes in net operating assets and liabilities used cash of $1.4 million.
the primary uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2017 were a $6.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $4.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $1.6 million decrease in warranty obligations. offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in inventory of $6.0 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $5.3 million.
for 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $33.0 million, primarily resulting from a net loss of $67.5 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $10.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.6 million, asset impairment and restructuring charges of $3.2 million, and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of $3.1 million. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $7.2 million.
the primary sources of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2016 were an $11.3 million increase in deferred revenue related to our enlighten service and deferred product revenue, an $8.8 million decrease in inventory, and a $8.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. offsetting these sources of cash was an increase in accounts receivable of $18.0 million and an increase in other assets of $4.8 million. the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and the increase in other assets was primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables.
for 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $21.2 million, primarily resulting from a net loss of $22.1 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $12.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.5 million, and net adjustments of $1.0 million for other non-cash items. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling $23.3 million.
the primary use of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2015 was attributable to a $19.2 million increase in inventory. the increase in inventory was attributed to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. other uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities included a $5.3 million increase in other assets primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables and the corresponding deferred costs of revenues, $3.4 million decrease in warranty obligations, $2.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued other liabilities due to timing of payments and a decrease in incentive compensation accrual and $2.5 million increase in accounts receivable. offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in deferred revenue of $9.7 million related to our enlighten service as well as deferred product revenue corresponding with the increase in customer financing receivables.
cash flows from investing activities for 2017, net cash used in investing activities of $4.1 million primarily resulted from purchases of test and assembly equipment, license fees for certain technology related to asic development and capitalized costs related to internal-use software.
for 2016, net cash used in investing activities of $11.8 million primarily resulted from purchases of test and assembly equipment, capitalized costs related to internal-use software and license fees for certain technology

related to asic development, and was partially offset by $1.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our services business.
for 2015, net cash used in investing activities of $12.5 million included $10.2 million for purchases of test and assembly equipment and $2.3 million of capitalized internal-use software costs.
cash flows from financing activities for 2017, net cash provided by financing activities of $43.3 million primarily consisted of $24.2 million additional net proceeds from amending our term loan with tcp and $27.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $2.8 million in proceeds from the sale of certain financing receivables offset by the $10.1 million repayment associated with the termination of our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank.
for 2016, net cash provided by financing activities of $34.4 million primarily consisted of $24.2 million net proceeds from our term loan and $17.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by $6.9 million net reduction in borrowings under our revolver and $0.7 million in debt issuance and equity offering costs.
for 2015, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $17.0 million from net borrowings made under our revolver to fund our working capital needs, $4.0 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans, $0.2 million in financing costs associated with the amended and restated revolving credit facility.

(1)   purchase obligations include amounts related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturer procures on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
(2)   on february 28, 2018 the term loan was amended to defer approximately 50% of the principal payments due in 2018. see note 10. "debt" to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2017, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, including associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.1 million. since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty, liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 10, "debt" and note 14, "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway, our cloud-based enlighten monitoring service, and ac battery storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. enlighten service revenue represented less than 2% of the total revenues for all periods presented.
revenue from sales of our products is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer; (iii) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. provisions for rebates, sales incentives, and discounts to customers are generally accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded. for some programs the provision is made at the later of when the related revenue is recognized or when the offer is made.
sales of an envoy communications gateway include the enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including, internal costs, gross margin and historical pricing practices. after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price, revenue from the sale of envoy hardware devices is recognized upon shipment, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. through september 30, 2017 the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices was used to determine the period over which revenue from the cloud-based monitoring service was recognized as adequate historical user data was not available. during the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined historical user data was available to adequately assess the period over which the service obligation was met. as a result, we shortened the estimated service period of the enlighten effective october 1, 20107 from 10 years to 6.5 years. the impact of the change in estimate was an increase to revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $2.6 million and a reduction of net loss per share of approximately $0.03.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). in cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market. the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were insignificant.

warranty obligations microinverters sold through december 31, 2013
our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product's warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters). on a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability. this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e. failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e. claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e. replacement cost).
estimated failure rates-our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf (mean time between failure) estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters, third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a microinverter fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure via enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
estimated claim rates-warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
estimated replacement costs-three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time (between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
in addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences. we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. if actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.
fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1, 2014
45
our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. under accounting standards codification ("asc") 825-financial instruments, ("fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. see note 8, ("fair value measurements") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory," which requires most entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value ("nrv"). this simplifies the evaluation from the current method of lower of cost or market, where market is based on one of three measures (i.e. replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less a normal profit margin). asu 2015-11 does not apply to inventories measured under the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method, and defines nrv as the "estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation." this standard, which was adopted in the first quarter of 2017, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting," which will simplify the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statements of consolidated cash flows. this standard, which was adopted in the first quarter of 2017, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment." this asu simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the fasb eliminated step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. under the amendments in this asu, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. the fasb also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. an entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. a public business entity that is an sec filer should adopt the amendments in this update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1, 2017. we adopted asu 2017-04 for the year beginning january 1, 2017. we have a single reporting unit, and adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers: topic 606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in august 2015, march 2016, april 2016, may 2016 and
46
december 2016, (collectively "topic 606"). topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap. the standard is effective for and was adopted by us on january 1, 2018.
the updated standard's core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts, estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied. in addition, the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.
the guidance permits two methods of adoption, the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. upon adoption we will use the modified retrospective method with a cumulative catch up adjustment to accumulated deficit and will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous gaap in our 2018 consolidated financial statements.
the most significant impacts upon adoption of the standard will be how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives will be recognized. under asc 605 our monitoring hardware and service are considered two units of accounting with a portion of the consideration related to the hardware recognized upfront and the remaining deferred over the estimated service period. under asc 606 the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred over the estimated service period. this treatment will result in an increase in deferred revenue of approximately $77 million, an increase in deferred costs of approximately $43 million and an increase in accumulated deficit of approximately $34 million upon adoption of asc 606.
under asc 605 we recorded certain contra revenue promotions at the later of the date revenue was recognized or the date at which the promotional offer was extended. under asc 606 all such contra revenue programs will be treated as variable consideration and recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded. this change in timing will result in an increase in accrued liabilities of approximately $6 million and an increase to accumulated deficit in the same amount upon adoption of asc 606. the change in accounting treatment affects the timing of the recognition of certain contra revenue programs, but the overall income statement impact of this new accounting method is expected to be immaterial.
under asc 605, we expensed commission costs as incurred. the new standard requires upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. under the new guidance, we will utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less, which typically results in expensing commissions paid. commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service will be capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue, which is 6.5 years. this treatment will result in an increase in deferred costs of approximately $0.8 million and an increase in accumulated deficit by the same amount upon adoption of asc 606. the amortization of these deferred costs is immaterial to our income statement.
we do not expect the adoption of asc 606 to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognition related to specific customer contracts.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, "recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities," which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. changes to the current guidance include the accounting for equity investments, the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments, and the assessment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities. in addition, asu 2016-01 establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. asu 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first
47
reporting period in which the guidance is effective. early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards codification ("asc") 842 ("asc 842"), "leases" which replaces the existing guidance in asc 840, leases.  asc 842 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2018. asc 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (rou) asset and a corresponding lease liability. for finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the rou asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-18 (asu 2016-18), "statement of cash flows," which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. asu 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-09 (asu 2017-09), "compensation - stock compensation."  asu 2017-09 was issued to provide clarity and reduce both 1) diversity in practice and 2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in topic 718 to a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.  asu 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under topic 718. asu 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

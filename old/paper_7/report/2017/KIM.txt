item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10-k.  historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification ("asc"). the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments and other investments, realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments.
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. in addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.
the company makes estimates of the collectability/recoverability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues. the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.
real estate the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the company elected to early adopt asu 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business at the beginning of its fiscal year ended december 31, 2017, including its interim periods within the year, and appropriately applied the guidance to its asset acquisitions of operating properties, which included the capitalization of acquisition costs.
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements (in years)                                                 15 to 50

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)   terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter
20
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and unleveraged) of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. if, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, are based upon an allocation of the investment's net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.
the company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in open-air shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. these joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the company's exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and, due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt, which may be guaranteed by the joint venture. the company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments.
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment.
the company's estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums. capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions the company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain non-u.s. investments. the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted.
a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on the evidence available, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the valuation allowance, which requires significant judgement from management, should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's judgement in determining a valuation allowance.
the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions, which requires significant judgment from management. although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company's income tax expense in the period in which a change is made, which could have a material impact on operating results (see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).

22
capital activity (for additional details see liquidity and capital resources below):
●   during the years ended december 31, 2017, the company repaid the following notes (dollars in millions):

type              date paid         amount repaid     interest rate    maturity date

medium term notes   aug-17 &amp; nov-17            $300.0   4.30%             feb-18
term loan           jan-17                         $250.0   libor + 0.95%     jan-17
●   in february 2017, the company closed on a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") with a group of banks, which is scheduled to expire in march 2021, which accrues interest at a rate of libor plus 87.5 basis points (2.28% as of december 31, 2017) with two additional six-month options to extend the maturity date, at the company's discretion, to march 2022.

●   also during 2017, the company (i) assumed/consolidated $257.5 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt (including a fair market value adjustment of $8.5 million) related to two operating properties, (ii) paid off $692.9 million of mortgage debt (including fair market value adjustments of $5.8 million) that encumbered 27 operating properties and (iii) obtained a $206.0 million non-recourse mortgage relating to one operating property.

●   as a result of the above activity, the company extended its debt maturity profile, including extension options, as follows:

●   as of december 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate was 3.84% and the weighted average maturity profile was 10.7 years.

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. the convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to have an impact on the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. to mitigate the effect of e-commerce on its business, the company's strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, national or regional discount department stores or drugstores, which offer day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items. in addition, the company's strategy includes investing capital into high quality assets, which are concentrated in major metro markets, allowing our tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume while also disposing of lesser quality assets in more undesirable locations.  for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see item 1a. "risk factors."
23
as the company moves forward, it intends to take steps to strengthen its portfolio in the rapidly changing retail environment. the company intends to continue to dispose of assets outside its core markets, which will allow it to concentrate its presence in target coastal markets by completing development projects underway and continuing to invest in redevelopment, ultimately producing a stronger portfolio for sustained long-term growth.

the following describes the activity of certain line items from the company's consolidated statements of income, which it believes represent items that significantly changed during the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016:
revenue from rental properties - the increase in revenues from rental properties of $31.4 million is primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition and consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, providing incremental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 of $57.5 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, and (ii) the completion of certain redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, providing incremental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 of $5.2 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of $31.3 million from properties sold during 2017 and 2016.
real estate taxes - real estate taxes increased $10.6 million primarily due to (i) an increase of $8.4 million related to the acquisition and consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, and (ii) an overall net increase of $5.0 million primarily due to refunds received during 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease of $2.8 million resulting from properties sold during 2017 and 2016.
24
impairment charges - during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $67.3 million and $93.3 million, respectively, for which the company's estimated fair values were primarily based upon (i) signed contracts or letters of intent from third party offers or (ii) discounted cash flow models. these adjustments to property carrying values were recognized in connection with the company's efforts to market certain properties and management's assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions. also, the company has re-evaluated its long-term plan for a property due to unfavorable local market conditions. certain of the calculations to determine fair value utilized unobservable inputs and as such are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. for additional disclosure, see footnote 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
depreciation and amortization - the increase in depreciation and amortization of $5.5 million is primarily due to (i) an increase of $21.8 million related to the acquisition/consolidation of operating properties during 2017 and 2016, and (ii) an increase of $15.2 million related to write-offs relating to the company's redevelopment projects in 2017 and 2016, partially offset by (iii) a decrease of $31.5 million resulting from property dispositions and tenant vacates in 2017 and 2016.
other (expense)/income, net - the change in other (expense)/income, net of $4.2 million is primarily due to (i) the recognition of a gain on forgiveness of debt of $3.1 million resulting from the foreclosure of an encumbered property during 2016, and (ii) lower equity in income from retail store lease investments of $2.8 million resulting from a lease termination during 2016, partially offset by (iii) an increase in gains on land sales of $1.5 million.

debt maturities for 2018 consist of: $73.0 million of consolidated debt; $203.7 million of unconsolidated joint venture debt; and $6.1 million of debt on properties included in the company's preferred equity program, assuming the utilization of extension options where available.  the 2018 consolidated debt maturities are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, borrowings from the company's credit facility and debt refinancing where applicable.  in addition, the company has $12.4 million of consolidated debt related to one non-recourse mortgage that is currently in default for which the company is working with the special servicers on a resolution.  the 2018 debt maturities on properties in the company's unconsolidated joint ventures and preferred equity program are anticipated to be repaid through operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate.
the company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintain its investment-grade senior, unsecured debt ratings.   the company may, from time-to-time, seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives.

dividends in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as the board of directors monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate. cash dividends paid were $506.2 million in 2017, $474.0 million in 2016, and $455.8 million in 2015.
although the company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. on october 24, 2017, the company's board of directors declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share, an annualized increase of 3.7%, payable to shareholders of record on january 2, 2018, which was paid on january 16, 2018. additionally, on january 30, 2018, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share payable to shareholders of record on april 3, 2018, which is scheduled to be paid on april 16, 2018.

hurricane impact the impact of hurricanes harvey, which struck texas on august 25, 2017, and irma, which struck florida on september 10, 2017, resulted in minimal damage to the company's properties located in texas and florida, with the majority of the impact related to debris removal.
on september 20, 2017, hurricane maria struck puerto rico as a category 4 hurricane which resulted in widespread damage, flooding, and power outages. the company has interests in seven operating properties located throughout puerto rico, aggregating 2.2 million square feet of gla, which were variously impacted by the hurricane. the company maintains a comprehensive property insurance policy on these properties with total coverage of up to $62.0 million, as well as business interruption insurance with coverage up to $39.3 million in the aggregate, subject to a collective deductible of $1.2 million.
as of december 31, 2017, the company's assessment of the damages sustained to its properties from hurricane maria resulted in a write-off to depreciation expense of $16.0 million, representing the estimated net book value of damaged assets. the company also recorded a corresponding receivable and credit to depreciation expense of $16.0 million for estimated property insurance recoveries related to the write-off. as such, there was no impact to net income during 2017 resulting from these adjustments. the company expects to collect property insurance proceeds (net of deductible) equal to the replacement cost of its damaged property, currently estimated to be approximately $26.0 million. as of december 31, 2017, the company received property insurance proceeds of $4.0 million and has a remaining receivable balance of $12.0 million which is included in other assets on the company's consolidated balance sheets. the company expects that the final replacement cost claim will exceed the amount written off due to property damage and that this excess amount will be recorded, net of the deductible, as income by the company upon full settlement and collection of the casualty insurance claim.
the company's business interruption insurance covers lost revenues as a result of the hurricane for a period of up to one year. after the expiration of one year following the loss, the policy has 365 days of extended period of indemnity which provides business interruption coverage in the event the properties have not fully recovered from the storm. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company had a reduction in revenues from rental properties of $3.4 million related to lost tenant revenue and rent abatements resulting from the impact of hurricane maria. during december 2017, the company received $1.6 million from its insurance provider for business interruption claims. the company is still in the process of assessing current and future business interruption insurance losses and will submit insurance claims for its estimated losses under its business interruption insurance policy.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law, making significant changes to taxation of corporations and individuals. effective for tax years beginning on january 1, 2018, this tax reform law reduces the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% for corporations and changed other certain tax provisions and deductions. asc 740, income taxes, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. as a result, the company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a tax provision of $1.1 million during 2017.
the company is subject to taxes on its activities in canada, puerto rico and mexico.  in general, under local country law applicable to the structures the company has in place and applicable treaties, the repatriation of cash to the company from its subsidiaries and joint ventures in canada, puerto rico and mexico generally are not subject to withholding tax. the company is subject to and also includes in its tax provision non-u.s. income taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the u.s. these investments are held by the company at the reit level and not in the company's taxable reit subsidiary. accordingly, the company does not expect a u.s. income tax impact associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company's foreign subsidiaries.

the company has $73.0 million of secured debt scheduled to mature in 2018. the company anticipates satisfying the remaining maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its credit facility, exercise of extension options, where available, and new debt issuances. in addition, the company has $12.4 million of consolidated debt related to one non-recourse mortgage that is currently in default for which the company is working with the special servicers on a resolution.
the company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for loans encumbering certain of the company's development and redevelopment projects and guarantee of payment related to the company's insurance program. as of december 31, 2017, these letters of credit aggregated $40.4 million.
in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2017, the company had $20.0 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
the company has accrued $4.0 million of non-current uncertain tax positions and related interest under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for income taxes, which are included in other liabilities on the company's consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2017. these amounts are not included in the table above because a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with the relevant tax authorities, if any, cannot be made.

off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties. such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors and individuals. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. as of december 31, 2017, the company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k). as of december 31, 2017, these investments include the following joint ventures:

the company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. as of december 31, 2017, these other unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $287.6 million. the aggregate debt as of december 31, 2017, of all of the company's unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is $1.7 billion. as of december 31, 2017, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from one month to nine years and bore interest at rates ranging from 2.91% to 7.25%. approximately $203.7 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2018. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with, operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other real estate investments the company previously provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties through its preferred equity program. as of december 31, 2017, the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $201.9 million relating to 357 properties, including 344 net leased properties. as of december 31, 2017, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $361.0 million. these loans have scheduled maturities ranging from eight months to seven years and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to 10.47%. due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis.
the company presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo available to the company's common shareholders when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
the company also presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo available to the company's common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company's operating real estate portfolio.

ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity.  our method of calculating ffo available to the company's common shareholders and ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
the company's reconciliation of net income available to the company's common shareholders to ffo available to the company's common shareholders and ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

same property net operating income ("same property noi")
same property noi is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity. the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. it excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for bad debt, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company's proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. the company's method of calculating same property noi available to the company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

same property noi increased by $2.7 million or 1.2% for the three months ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. this increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase of $3.0 million related to lease-up and rent commencements in the portfolio and (ii) an increase in other property income of $0.9 million, partially offset by (iii) an increase of $1.2 million of credit losses. the percentage increase in same property noi for the three months ended december 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the impact of hurricane maria on the company's puerto rico properties.
same property noi increased by $14.9 million or 1.7% for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. this increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase of $11.7 million related to lease-up and rent commencements in the portfolio, (ii) an increase in other property income of $1.8 million and (iii) a decrease of $1.4 million of credit losses. the percentage increase in same property noi for the year ended december 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to the impact of hurricane maria on the company's puerto rico properties.
effects of inflation many of the company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. most of the company's leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

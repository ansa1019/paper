item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of franklin resources, inc. ("franklin") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" section set forth in part i and the "risk factors" section set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k and in any more recent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.
overview we are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through products that include investment funds and institutional, high net-worth and separately-managed accounts (collectively, our "sponsored investment products" or "sips"). in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, marketing, shareholder servicing, and other services. our sips and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to investors globally under nine distinct brand names: franklin®, templeton®, franklin mutual series®, franklin bissett®, fiduciary trusttm, darby®, balanced equity management®, k2® and libertyshares®. we offer a broad range of sips under equity, multi-asset/balanced, fixed income and cash management funds and accounts, including alternative investment products, that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. we also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management ("aum"). as noted in the "risk factors" section set forth above in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k, the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. the level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales, the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts and the fee rates charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our sips or our clients. these arrangements could change in the future.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 ("fiscal year 2017"), the global equity financial markets provided positive returns, reflecting, among other things, generally positive global economic data tempered by political uncertainty, as the s&p 500 index and the msci world index increased 18.6% and 18.8%. the global bond markets were negatively impacted by rising interest rates and concerns of higher inflation but showed signs of stabilization over the second half of the fiscal year, and the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index decreased 1.3% for the fiscal year.
our total aum was $753.2 billion at september 30, 2017, 3% higher than at september 30, 2016 due to $58.5 billion of net market change and other, partially offset by $38.6 billion of net outflows. simple monthly average aum ("average aum") decreased 2% during fiscal year 2017. the decline in average aum negatively affected our fee revenues and operating income for the fiscal year.
the business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations and registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business and add complexity to our global compliance operations.
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our sips and on providing high quality customer service to our clients. we continuously perform reviews of our business model. while we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. we will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the "risk factors" section in part i of this annual report.

1    defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues.
operating income decreased $101.4 million in fiscal year 2017 as a 3% decrease in operating revenues was partially offset by a 3% decrease in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. decreased $30.0 million as the decrease in operating income was significantly offset by a $152.3 million increase in investment and other income, net, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests.
operating income decreased $661.9 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 ("fiscal year 2016") as a 17% decrease in operating revenues was partially offset by a 14% decrease in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. decreased $308.6 million primarily due to the decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $143.6 million increase in investment and other income, net.
diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2017 despite the decrease in net income and decreased in fiscal year 2016 consistent with net income, and were impacted by 4% and 5% decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding, primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock.

aum increased $19.9 billion or 3% during fiscal year 2017 due to $58.5 billion of net market change and other, partially offset by $38.6 billion of net outflows. net market change and other primarily consists of $78.0 billion of market appreciation and a $2.9 billion increase from foreign exchange revaluation, net of $23.0 billion of long-term distributions. the market appreciation occurred primarily in equity, global/international fixed income and multi-asset/balanced products, and reflected positive returns in global markets, as evidenced by increases of 18.8% and 18.6% in the msci world index and s&p 500 index, and strong performance of our global/international fixed income products despite a 1.3% decrease in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index. the foreign exchange revaluation resulted from aum in products that are not u.s. dollar denominated, which represented approximately 14% of total aum as of september 30, 2017. the net outflows, which occurred in all long-term investment objectives and most significantly in equity and multi-asset/balanced products, included $8.1 billion from two global/international fixed income funds with global macro strategies that had underperformed against their peer groups during fiscal year 2016, $3.9 billion from three institutional separate accounts, $3.0 billion from two sub-advised variable annuity clients due to shifts in their investment strategies and $2.6 billion from two global/international equity funds. the outflows also included $1.2 billion from a multi-asset/balanced fund and $1.0 billion from a u.s. equity fund, both of which had underperformed against their peer groups during most of fiscal year 2016, and were partially offset by inflows of $4.0 billion in a global/international fixed income fund that outperformed its peer group during fiscal year 2017. long-term sales increased 10% to $112.3 billion from the prior year due to higher sales in all long-term investment objectives with the exception of tax-free fixed income. long-term redemptions decreased 9% to $169.7 billion primarily due to lower redemptions of global/international fixed income products.
aum decreased $37.6 billion or 5% during fiscal year 2016 due to $62.4 billion of net outflows partially offset by $24.8 billion of net market change and other. the net outflows, which occurred primarily in global/international products, included $28.1 billion from four global/international fixed income funds with global macro strategies that had underperformed against their peer groups during fiscal year 2016, $4.7 billion redeemed by a sub-advised variable annuity client, $4.2 billion from three institutional products, and $3.6 billion from two global/international equity funds. the outflows also included $4.3 billion from a multi-asset/balanced fund and $1.1 billion from a u.s. equity fund, both of which had underperformed against their peer groups during most of fiscal year 2016, and were partially offset by a $5.5 billion inflow for an institutional global macro mandate. long-term sales decreased 37% to $101.7 billion from the prior year, and long-term redemptions decreased 11% to $186.9 billion. both declines occurred in all long-term investment objectives, primarily in global/international products, with the exception of tax-free fixed income sales. net market change and other primarily consists of $50.9 billion of market appreciation and a $2.4 billion increase from foreign exchange revaluation, net of $27.8 billion of long-term distributions. the market appreciation occurred in all investment objectives and reflected positive returns in global markets, as evidenced by increases in the msci world index of 12.0%, the s&p 500 index of 15.4% and the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index of 8.8%. the foreign exchange revaluation resulted from aum in products that are not u.s. dollar denominated, which represented approximately 14% of total aum as of september 30, 2016.

investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our sips. a standard measure of the performance of these investment products is the percentage of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians. our global/international fixed income products generated notable long-term results with at least 82% of aum exceeding the benchmarks and peer group medians for the one-, five- and ten-year periods ended september 30, 2017. strong performance for these products during fiscal year 2017 resulted in significant improvements from september 30, 2016 to the benchmark and peer group median comparisons for the one- and three-year periods. the performance of our multi-asset/balanced products significantly exceeded the benchmarks and peer group medians for the one-year period and the peer group medians for the ten-year period, but has lagged in the other comparisons, reflecting the performance of a fund that represents approximately 70% of this category. the performance of our tax-free and u.s. taxable fixed income, as well as of our equity products, has mostly lagged the benchmarks and peer group medians during the periods presented.

investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sips and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of the market value of aum. annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. rates for products sold outside of the u.s. are generally higher than for u.s. products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs.
investment management fees decreased $112.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in average aum and the impact of a lower effective fee rate, partially offset by higher performance fees. investment management fees decreased $856.1 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a 14% decrease in average aum and the impact of a lower effective fee rate. the decrease in average aum in fiscal year 2017 occurred primarily in the global/international fixed income investment objective, and across all sales regions except asia-pacific. the decrease in average aum in fiscal year 2016 occurred in all sales regions and primarily in the global/international and multi-asset/balanced investment objectives.
our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average aum) was 59.2, 59.7 and 61.3 basis points for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to higher weightings of aum in lower fee products in the global/international fixed income investment objective in the europe, middle east and africa and asia-pacific sales regions, partially offset by higher performance fees. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to higher weightings of aum in u.s. products and in lower fee products in global/international investment objectives in the europe, middle east and africa and asia-pacific sales regions, partially offset by higher performance fees.
performance-based investment management fees were $35.5 million, $26.5 million and $19.8 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. the increases in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to performance fees earned from separately-managed accounts.
u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were as follows:

________________
1   u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper, a thomson reuters company, as of september 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and include all u.s.-registered open-end funds that reported expense data to lipper as of the funds' most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. as defined by lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included.
2   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect higher weightings of two large low fee funds.
3   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect higher weightings of a large low fee fund and lower weightings of two large higher fee funds.
our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the u.s. industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international aum, both of which generate higher fees. our effective investment management fee rates in the u.s. decreased during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, but to a lesser extent than the average industry rates.

our product offerings and global operations are diverse. as such, the impact of future changes in the market value of aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.
sales and distribution fees we earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sips on which investors pay a commission at the time of purchase ("commissionable sales"). sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. therefore, sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors.
globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. specifically, the majority of u.s.-registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under rule 12b-1 (the "rule 12b-1 plans") promulgated under the investment company act of 1940. the rule 12b-1 plans permit the mutual funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the rule 12b-1 plans' limitations on amounts based on average daily net aum. similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non-u.s. funds.
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sips to investors on our behalf. see the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.
sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below.

asset-based distribution fees decreased $65.5 million and $288.3 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily due to decreases of $55.2 million and $273.1 million from 4% and 14% decreases in the related average aum. the decrease in fiscal year 2016 also includes $11.3 million from the implementation of lower rule 12b-1 plan fee rates for certain funds effective august 1, 2015.
sales-based fees decreased $35.6 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $18.8 million from lower effective fee rates and $18.5 million from a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. the lower effective fee rates primarily resulted from a higher mix of non-u.s. product fixed income sales and tiered pricing on larger trades. non-u.s. products typically generate lower sales fees than u.s. products, and fixed income products typically generate lower sales fees than equity products. total commissionable sales increased 4%, however the increase resulted from significantly higher sales of non-u.s. products that were largely offset by lower sales of u.s. products; the lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales resulted in a net decrease in sales-based fees.
sales-based fees decreased $156.4 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a $158.5 million decrease from a 29% decrease in total commissionable sales.
commissionable sales represented 11% of total sales for fiscal year 2017, 12% for fiscal year 2016, and 10% for fiscal year 2015. u.s. product commissionable sales were 72%, 92% and 88% of total commissionable sales for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. these charges are levied only on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares.

shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. in some instances, we charge sips these fees based on the level of aum. in the u.s., transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. accordingly, the level of fees varies with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. approximately 0.6 million and 1.2 million accounts closed in the u.s. during calendar years 2016 and 2015.
we also provide other services to individual and trust clients, including trust services, for which fees are based on the level of aum, and estate planning and tax planning and preparation, for which fees are primarily account based.
shareholder servicing fees decreased $17.9 million and $19.2 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily due to decreases of $14.8 million and $9.4 million from sips in the u.s. resulting from decreases in active accounts, and $3.6 million and $9.5 million from sips in europe resulting from lower levels of related aum and decreases in active accounts.
other other revenue increased $5.4 million in fiscal year 2017 and decreased $9.4 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to changes in interest and dividend income from consolidated sips.

sales, distribution and marketing sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily consist of payments to financial advisers, broker-dealers and other third parties for providing services to investors in our sips, including marketing support services. sales expenses are determined as percentages of sales and are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues. distribution expenses are determined as percentages of aum and are incurred from assets that generate either distribution fees or higher levels of investment management fees. marketing support expenses are based on aum, sales or a combination thereof. also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to up-front commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. the deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

asset-based expenses decreased $56.9 million and $368.3 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily due to decreases of $62.4 million and $352.4 million from 3% and 14% decreases in the related average aum. distribution expenses, which are typically higher for non-u.s. products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees.
sales-based expenses decreased $18.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million from lower average commission rates and $9.0 million from a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. the lower average commission rates primarily resulted from a higher mix of non-u.s. product fixed income sales and tiered pricing on larger trades. non-u.s. products typically generate lower sales commissions than u.s. products, and fixed income products typically generate lower sales commissions than equity products. total commissionable sales increased 4%, however the increase resulted from significantly higher sales of non-u.s. products that were largely offset by lower sales of u.s. products; the lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales resulted in a net decrease in sales-based expenses.
sales-based expenses decreased $146.5 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to $133.7 million from a 29% decrease in commissionable sales. the decrease also included $6.7 million in india primarily related to lower sales and regulatory-driven changes in fee structure, and $6.6 million from lower marketing support expense primarily resulting from the change in fee structure for certain service providers and lower related sales.
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $3.2 million and $37.6 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily due to $18.5 million and $25.8 million related to lower sales of u.s. shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. the decrease in fiscal year 2017 was substantially offset by $12.7 million of adjustments recognized in fiscal year 2016 related to prior-year amortization expense and $4.3 million from higher sales of non-u.s. shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors.
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses decreased $27.2 million in fiscal year 2017 due to a $55.7 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, partially offset by a $28.5 million increase in variable compensation. the decrease in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to decreases of $51.4 million in termination benefits and $19.9 million from a higher weighting of employees in lower cost regions outside the u.s., partially offset by an $18.3 million increase for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2016 and 2015. the increase in variable compensation was primarily due to increases of $13.1 million from higher market valuations of mutual fund awards, $13.1 million in bonus expense based on our overall performance and $6.5 million from higher sales-related commissions, partially offset by an $8.3 million decrease in amortization of stock and stock unit awards.
compensation and benefit expenses decreased $92.4 million in fiscal year 2016 due to a $108.4 million decrease in variable compensation, partially offset by a $16.0 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits. the variable compensation decrease was primarily due to $81.2 million related to our lower performance, as well as $8.9 million related to private equity and other product performance fees. the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to increases of $55.7 million in termination benefits and $18.0 million for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2015 and 2014, largely offset by decreases of $35.0 million from lower staffing levels and $16.2 million from favorable currency impacts. the increase in termination benefits was primarily due to special benefits related to the voluntary separation of approximately 300 employees.
variable compensation as a percentage of compensation and benefits was 36%, 33% and 38% for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. at september 30, 2017, our global workforce had increased to approximately 9,400 employees from approximately 9,100 at september 30, 2016.
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. as such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sips or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. however, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.

information systems and technology information systems and technology expenses increased $12.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to higher external data service and software costs, and decreased $17.0 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower technology consulting costs.

occupancy we conduct our worldwide operations using a combination of leased and owned facilities. occupancy expenses include rent and other facilities-related costs including depreciation and utilities.
occupancy expenses decreased $12.8 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower rent expense. occupancy expenses increased $1.4 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher rent expense, substantially offset by lower building maintenance costs and depreciation.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of fund-related service fees payable to external parties, advertising and promotion, professional fees, travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses.
general, administrative and other operating expenses decreased $17.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower expenses related to intangible assets and contingent consideration, partially offset by higher consolidated sips, advertising and promotion, and travel and entertainment expenses. definite-lived intangible asset impairment decreased $18.6 million and amortization expense decreased $6.5 million, both primarily resulting from a prior-year impairment related to the k2 advisors holdings, llc ("k2") acquisition. contingent consideration expense decreased $12.8 million due to revised estimates of k2's future revenues and profits and a decline in other acquisition-related aum. the decreases were partially offset by increases of $9.8 million in consolidated sips expenses, $6.7 million in advertising and promotion expenses and $4.5 million in travel and entertainment expenses.
general, administrative and other operating expenses decreased $8.4 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower levels of travel and entertainment, contingent consideration expense, and advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher levels of net intangible asset expenses, consolidated sips expenses, professional fees and third-party servicing fees. corporate cost reduction initiatives resulted in decreases of $14.7 million in travel and entertainment expenses and $10.6 million in advertising and promotion expenses. contingent consideration expense decreased $14.5 million primarily due to revised estimates of k2's future revenues and profits. net expenses from definite-lived intangible assets, primarily related to the k2 acquisition, increased $10.3 million as $20.0 million of increased impairment due to higher investor redemptions, lower estimates of future sales and renegotiations of certain investment management fees was offset by a related $9.7 million decrease in amortization. consolidated sips expenses increased $9.0 million, professional fees increased $6.2 million related to various corporate activities, and third-party service fees increased $5.5 million primarily due to higher sub-advisory expenses.
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. as a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenses may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues.

other income, net increased $150.7 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to gains on investments held by consolidated sips and higher income from equity method investees and interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on trading investment securities and net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities. investments held by consolidated sips generated net gains of $118.2 million, as compared to net losses of $13.5 million in the prior year. the gains were primarily from higher market valuations of holdings by various global/international private equity funds and from a net increase of 20 consolidated sips due to adoption of new accounting guidance on october 1, 2016. income from equity method investees increased $51.2 million primarily due to gains on investments held by a global macro hedge fund sip and a global equity fund. interest income increased $38.4 million primarily due to higher levels of interest rates and debt securities. the increases were partially offset by a $37.9 million decrease in net gains on trading investment securities primarily due to lower gains from fixed income sips held for investment purposes, partially offset by gains on corporate debt securities, as compared to losses in the prior year, and a $24.9 million decrease in net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities. the investments in sips that were classified as trading securities and available-for-sale securities in the prior year were significantly reduced on october 1, 2016 as a substantial amount of the investments were in sips that were consolidated as a result of the new accounting guidance.
other income, net increased $133.3 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher market valuations, which resulted in net investment income and gains, and higher interest income, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange and investments of consolidated sips. equity method investees generated income of $56.7 million as compared to losses of $63.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to gains on investments held by two global equity funds and lower losses on investments held by a global macro hedge fund sip. trading investment securities generated net gains of $50.1 million as compared to net losses of $22.3 million in the prior year, primarily related to gains from fixed income sips held for investment purposes. interest income increased $25.7 million primarily due to higher levels of debt securities and cash equivalents. these increases were partially offset by $2.9 million of foreign currency exchange net losses as compared to net gains of $57.0 million in the prior year primarily from the impact of strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in u.s. dollars held in europe, and $13.5 million of net losses on investments of consolidated sips as compared to net gains of $18.0 million in the prior year.
significant portions of the net gains (losses) of consolidated sips are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.
our investments in sips include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. the market conditions that impact our aum similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sips investments.

______________
1   see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k for information on investment accounting classifications.
2   other consists of $112.7 million of available-for-sale investments and $12.8 million of investments in life settlement contracts, both of which are measured at fair value, and $60.1 million of investments carried at cost.
the percentages of direct cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our u.s. and non-u.s. operations were 20% and 80% at september 30, 2017.
investments of consolidated sips are generally assigned a classification in the table above based on the investment objective of the sip holding the securities.
taxes on income as a multi-national corporation, we provide many of our services from locations outside the u.s. some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the u.s. additionally, in certain countries our income is subject to reduced tax rates due to tax rulings. the mix of pre-tax income subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the u.s., produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing u.s. federal and state income tax rates.
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 29.8% as compared to 29.7% in fiscal year 2016 and 30.5% in fiscal year 2015. the rate increase in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to foreign earnings subject to u.s. taxes and the prior-year recognition of tax benefits in u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions as a result of various adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits including the expiration of statutes of limitations, substantially offset by higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the rate decrease in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a higher mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions partially offset by lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
45
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non-u.s. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in u.s. taxable income. changes in tax rates in these jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a larger net increase in trading securities of consolidated sips. net cash provided by investing activities decreased mainly due to net purchases of the company's investments, as compared to net liquidations in the prior year, and the adoption of new accounting guidance. net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to net subscriptions in consolidated sips by noncontrolling interests, as compared to net distributions in the prior year, and lower repurchases of common stock, partially offset by payments on the company's debt, higher payments on debt by consolidated sips and prior-year proceeds from a loan.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net income and losses from investments in equity method investees as compared to income in the prior year. net cash provided by investing activities decreased mainly due to lower liquidations, net of purchases, of the company's investments and investments of consolidated sips, and higher net additions of property and equipment, partially offset by higher net liquidations of other investments by consolidated sips. net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock, prior-year proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, and net distributions from consolidated sips by noncontrolling interests as compared to net subscriptions in the prior year, partially offset by lower dividends paid on common stock.
the assets and liabilities of our consolidated sips attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. we have no right to the sips' assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management fees earned from them. the debt holders of the consolidated sips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the sips' liabilities. accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our consolidated sips, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.
our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:

46
liquidity liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the purchase date, money market funds, time deposits with maturities of three months or less, and deposits with financial institutions. liquid investments consist of trading and available-for-sale securities, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund sips, direct investments in redeemable consolidated sips, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.
cash and cash equivalents at september 30, 2017 increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating and investing activities, partially offset by net cash used in financing activities.
we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions relating to our sips. certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents. as a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. also, as a multi-national corporation, we operate in various locations outside of the u.s. certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements. such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the u.s. should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated domestically, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases, or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non-u.s. jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance. certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings. at september 30, 2017, our u.s. and non-u.s. entities held $861.8 million and $2,620.1 million of liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to our sips, as compared to $874.6 million and $2,220.8 million held at september 30, 2016. included in these amounts were u.s. and non-u.s. liquid assets that were restricted from transfer to franklin and other subsidiaries of $4.1 million and $163.3 million at september 30, 2017 and $4.7 million and $345.7 million at september 30, 2016.
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted private placement program.
in prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. we repaid $300.0 million of these notes upon maturity in september 2017. at september 30, 2017, $1,049.0 million of the notes were outstanding with an aggregate face value of $1,050.0 million. the notes were issued at fixed interest rates and consist of $350.0 million at 4.625% per annum which mature in 2020, $300.0 million at 2.800% per annum which mature in 2022, and $400.0 million at 2.850% per annum which mature in 2025.
interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. the notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. the indentures governing the notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. the indentures also include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity.
in march 2016, we borrowed 6.3 billion indian rupees ($93.4 million) at a fixed interest rate of 9.89% with a one-year term to purchase certain securities from sips domiciled in india. the loan was secured by a standby letter of credit for 6.5 billion indian rupees ($96.6 million) collateralized by a $116.0 million time deposit. the loan agreement was amended in february 2017 with a revised maturity of march 2018, and the loan was fully paid in september 2017.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2017.
at september 30, 2017, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012.

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, acquire shares of our common stock, invest in our sips, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt.
we declare dividends on a quarterly basis. we declared regular cash dividends of $0.80 per share ($0.20 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2017 and $0.72 per share ($0.18 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2016. we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 19.1 million and 36.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $771.5 million and $1,324.3 million. at september 30, 2017, 31.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program, which is not subject to an expiration date.
we invested $4.2 million, net of redemptions, in our sips during fiscal year 2017, and redeemed $514.2 million, net of investments, from our sips during fiscal year 2016.
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. while we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. we did not provide financial or other support to our sips during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we purchased $182.7 million of certain debt securities from six sips domiciled in india in order to provide additional liquidity to the sips.

__________________
1   debt principal represents maturity amount.
2   purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees.
3   committed capital contributions relate to discretionary commitments to invest in sips and other investment products. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown as they are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment periods.
4   contingent consideration liability relates to the company's commitment to acquire the remaining interests in k2.
the debt holders of consolidated sips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments, therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities' liabilities and have not included them in the table above. see note 9 - consolidated sponsored investment products in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
at september 30, 2017, our consolidated balance sheet included liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $81.1 million and related accrued interest of $10.4 million (see note 11 - taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k). because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of future cash outflows, unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest have not been included in the table above.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. these estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions. described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. for additional information about our accounting policies, see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and sips in which we have a controlling financial interest. we have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity ("voe") or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie").
49
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity's legal organization and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. our vies are all investment entities and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and certain investment management fees earned from these entities.
we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. investment management fees earned from vies are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. the key estimates and assumptions used in the analyses include the amount of aum and the life of the investment product. these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. for example, aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, contributions, withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily. in addition, third-party purchases and redemptions, which are outside of our control, can impact our evaluation. there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. as of september 30, 2017, we were the primary beneficiary of 37 sip vies.
fair value measurements we use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below. our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
level 1   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, which may include published net asset values ("nav") for fund products.
level 2   observable inputs other than level 1 quoted prices, such as non-binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data. level 2 quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third-party brokers or dealers, including prices derived from model-based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data. quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third-party vendors.
level 3   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
quoted market prices may be adjusted if events occur, such as significant price changes in u.s.-traded market proxies after the close of corresponding foreign markets, trade halts or suspensions, or unscheduled market closures. the market proxies consist of correlated country-specific exchange-traded securities, such as futures, american depositary receipts indices or exchange-traded funds. the price adjustments are primarily determined based on third-party factors derived from model-based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market.
50
the fair values for level 3 assets and liabilities are determined using various methodologies in accordance with our global valuation and pricing policy which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type. we may employ a market-based method, using purchase multiples observed for comparable third-party transactions, valuations of comparable entities, projected operating results of the investee entity or subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entity. if the inputs for a market-based method are not available, we utilize an income-based method, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment. a discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment. we review and approve the market-based and income-based methods on a periodic basis for changes that would impact the unobservable inputs incorporated into the valuation process. the fair value measurements from these methods are further validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing and market comparable sales.
we record a substantial amount of our investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. investments in fund products for which fair value is estimated using nav as a practical expedient (when the nav is available to us as an investor but is not publicly available) are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value.
as of september 30, 2017, level 3 assets represented 13% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to consolidated sips' investments in equity and debt securities and our direct investments in debt securities that are not traded in active markets. there was one level 3 liability, a contingent consideration liability which represented 85% of total liabilities measured at fair value. there were insignificant transfers out of level 3 and no transfers into level 3 during fiscal year 2017.
following are descriptions of the significant assets and liability measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies.
investment securities, trading consist of corporate debt securities, nonconsolidated sips and other debt and equity securities. the fair value of the corporate debt securities is determined using market pricing. the fair values of all sips and certain other equity securities are determined based on their published nav. the fair values of certain other debt and equity securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes. the fair value of certain other debt securities is determined based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs.
investment securities, available-for-sale consist primarily of nonconsolidated sips and to a lesser extent, debt and other equity securities. the fair value of the sips is determined based on their published nav. the fair value of the debt securities is primarily determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes. the fair value of other equity securities is determined using quoted market prices.
investment securities, available-for-sale are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer.
investments of consolidated sips consist of trading securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. the fair value of the trading securities is determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available.
the investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of debt and equity securities of entities in emerging markets and fund products. the fair values of the debt and equity securities are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach. the fair value of the fund products is determined using nav as a practical expedient.
contingent consideration liability consists of the expected future payments related to our commitment to acquire the remaining interests in k2 and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. the liability is determined using an income-based method which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows based on estimated future revenue and profits and timing of payments.
51
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. other intangible assets consist of investment management contracts resulting from business acquisitions. we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to 15 years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period.
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an ongoing basis.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. we have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned.
we may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. a quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the related reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in the second step, impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill.
the quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, impairment is recognized in the amount of the difference in values.
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted. our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate, effective tax rate, and discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and the discount rate.
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of august 1, 2017. we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of the valuation of goodwill and 88% of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit and the specific intangible assets exceed their carrying values. we performed a quantitative test for the remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets and did not recognize any impairment because our estimated fair values of the assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 20%.
we subsequently monitor market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. we considered, among other things, changes in our aum and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of august 1, 2017. we also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. subsequent to august 1, 2017, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired.
while we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment.
52
revenues investment management, distribution and shareholder servicing fees are recognized as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance-based investment management fees, which are recognized when earned. sales commissions related to the sale of shares of sips are recognized on trade date. investment management fees, other than performance-based fees, and distribution fees are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using average daily aum. performance-based investment management fees are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts. shareholder servicing fees are generally calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced.
aum is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by sips and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. the fair values of the underlying securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type.
pricing of the securities held by sips is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. as of september 30, 2017, our total aum by fair value hierarchy level was 54% level 1, 45% level 2 and 1% level 3.
as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses.
as a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the u.s. and generate earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of all our non-u.s. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the u.s. or subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements. as a result, we have not recognized a provision for u.s. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $9.0 billion of cumulative undistributed non-u.s. earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30, 2017. changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non-u.s. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. in management's opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of september 30, 2017 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. see also note 12 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.

2017 transaction overview master transactions and cooperation agreement with brookdale on november 1, 2017, hcp and brookdale entered into a master transactions and cooperation agreement (the "mtca") to provide us with the ability to significantly reduce our concentration of assets leased to and/or managed by brookdale (the "brookdale transaction"). through a series of dispositions and transitions of assets currently leased to and/or managed by brookdale, as contemplated by the mtca, our exposure to brookdale is expected to be significantly reduced.
in connection with the overall transaction pursuant to the mtca, hcp (through certain of its subsidiaries), and brookdale (through certain of its subsidiaries) (the "lessee") entered into an amended and restated master lease and security agreement (the "amended master lease"), which amended and restated the then-existing triple-net leases between the parties for 78 assets (before giving effect to the contemplated sale or transition of 34 assets discussed below), which account for primarily all of the assets subject to triple-net leases between hcp and the lessee. under the amended master lease, we have the benefit of a guaranty from brookdale of the lessee's obligations and, upon a change in control, will have various additional protections under the mtca and the amended master lease.
the amended master lease preserves the renewal terms and, with certain exceptions, the rents under the previously existing triple-net leases. in addition, hcp and brookdale agreed to the following:
•   we have the right to sell, or transition to other operators, 32 triple-net assets. if such sale or transition does not occur within one year, the triple-net lease with respect to such assets will convert to a cash flow lease (under which we will bear the risks and rewards of operating the assets) with a term of two years, provided that we have the right to terminate the cash flow lease at any time during the term without penalty;
•   we have provided an aggregate $5 million annual reduction in rent on three assets, effective january 1, 2018; and
•   we will sell two triple-net assets to brookdale or its affiliates for $35 million, which we anticipate completing during the first half of 2018.
36
also pursuant to the mtca, hcp and brookdale agreed to the following:
•   hcp, which owned 90% of the interests in its ridea i and ridea iii joint ventures with brookdale at the time the mtca was executed, agreed to purchase brookdale's 10% noncontrolling interest in each joint venture for an aggregate purchase price of $95 million. these joint ventures collectively own and operate 58 independent living, assisted living, memory care and/or skilled nursing facilities (the "ridea facilities"). we completed our acquisition of the ridea iii noncontrolling interest in december 2017 and anticipate completing our acquisition of the ridea i noncontrolling interest during the first half of 2018;
•   we have the right to sell, or transition to other managers, 36 of the ridea facilities and terminate related management agreements with an affiliate of brookdale without penalty. if the related management agreements are not terminated within one year, the base management fee (5% of gross revenues) increases by 1% of gross revenues per year over the following two years to a maximum of 7% of gross revenues;
•   we will sell four of the ridea facilities to brookdale or its affiliates for $239 million, one of which was sold in january 2018 for $27 million. we anticipate completing the sale of the remaining three ridea facilities during the first half of 2018;
•   a brookdale affiliate continues to manage the remaining 18 ridea facilities pursuant to amended and restated management agreements, which provide for extended terms on select assets, modified performance hurdles for extensions and incentive fees, and modified termination rights (including stricter performance-based termination rights, a staggered right to terminate seven agreements over a 10 year period beginning in 2021, and a right to terminate at will upon payment of a termination fee, in lieu of sale-related termination rights), and two other existing facilities managed in separate ridea structures; and
•   we have the right to sell, to certain permitted transferees, our 49% ownership interest in joint ventures that own and operate a portfolio of continuing care retirement communities and in which brookdale owns the other 51% interest (the "ccrc jv"), subject to certain conditions and a right of first offer in favor of brookdale. brookdale will have a corresponding right to sell its 51% interest in the ccrc jv to certain permitted transferees, subject to certain conditions, a right of first offer and a right to terminate management agreements following such sale of brookdale's interest, each in favor of hcp. following a change in control of brookdale, we will have the right to initiate a sale of the ccrc portfolio, subject to certain rights of first offer and first refusal in favor of brookdale.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
ridea ii sale transaction in january 2017, we completed the contribution of our ownership interest in ridea ii to an unconsolidated jv owned by hcp and an investor group led by columbia pacific advisors, llc ("cpa") ("hcp/cpa propco" and "hcp/cpa opco," together, the "hcp/cpa jv"). in addition, ridea ii was recapitalized with $602 million of debt, of which $360 million was provided by a third-party and $242 million was provided by hcp. in return for both transaction elements, we received combined proceeds of $480 million from the hcp/cpa jv and $242 million in loan receivables and retained an approximately 40% ownership interest in ridea ii (the note receivable and 40% ownership interest are herein referred to as the "ridea ii investments"). this transaction resulted in us deconsolidating the net assets of ridea ii and recognizing a net gain on sale of $99 million. the ridea ii investments are currently recognized and accounted for as equity method investments.
on november 1, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with an investor group led by cpa to sell our remaining 40% ownership interest in ridea ii. we expect the transaction to close in 2018. cpa has also agreed to refinance our $242 million loan receivables from ridea ii within one year following the closing of the transaction.
investment transactions during the second quarter of 2017, we acquired a 124,000 square foot campus in the sorrento mesa submarket of san diego, california for $26 million. upon acquisition, we commenced repositioning one of the buildings into class-a lab space following an office-to-lab conversion strategy.
during the third quarter of 2017, we acquired a portfolio of three medical office buildings in texas for $49 million and a life science facility in south san francisco, california for $64 million.
37
during the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the following investments:

dividends quarterly cash dividends paid during 2017 aggregated to $1.48 per share. on february 1, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per common share. the dividend will be paid on march 2, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 15, 2018.
results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) senior housing triple-net, (ii) senior housing operating portfolio (shop), (iii) life science and (iv) medical office. under the medical office and life science segments, we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs and life science facilities, which generally require a greater level of property management. our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triple-net leases and ridea structures. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of our u.k. care homes, debt investments, unconsolidated joint ventures and hospitals. we evaluate performance based upon: (i) property net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") and (ii) adjusted noi (cash noi) in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as rental and related revenues, including tenant recoveries,
39
resident fees and services, and income from dfls, less property level operating expenses; noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. the adjustments to noi and resulting adjusted noi for shop have been recast for prior periods presented to conform to the current period presentation which excludes the impact of deferred community fee income and expense, resulting in recognition as cash is received and expenses are paid. adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." during the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of a change in how operating results are reported to our chief operating decision makers for the purpose of evaluating performance and allocating resources, we began excluding unconsolidated joint ventures from the evaluation of our segments' operating results. unconsolidated joint ventures are now reflected in other non-reportable segments, and as a result, excluded from noi and adjusted noi. prior period noi and adjusted noi have also been recast to conform to current period presentation which excludes unconsolidated joint ventures. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same property portfolio ("spp"), as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi. noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items. further, our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
same property portfolio spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties. spp noi excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis. spp noi for properties that undergo a change in ownership is reported based on the current ownership percentage.
properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure, such as a transition from a triple-net lease to a ridea reporting structure, are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations or changes its reporting structure (such as triple-net to shop).
for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro-rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate
40
economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro-rata presentations of reconciling items included in ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro-rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro-rata financial information as a supplement.
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
in addition, we present ffo before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets, severance and related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs, casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains) and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties, and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of deferred compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (v) non-cash interest and depreciation related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents) and (vi) deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, fad: (i) is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and (ii) includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc non-refundable entrance fees. certain prior period amounts in the "non-gaap financial measures reconciliation" below for fad have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. more specifically, we have combined wholly-owned and our share from unconsolidated joint ventures recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("fad capital expenditures") into a single line item. in addition, we have combined cash ccrc jv entrance fees with ccrc jv entrance fee amortization into a single line item, separately disclosed deferred income taxes (previously reported in "other") and collapsed immaterial line items into 'other'. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of fad for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our fad to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual
41
ownership percentage for the applicable periods (see ffo above for further disclosure regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations). other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad, and accordingly, our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits, management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. we believe fad is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, (iv) severance-related expenses and (v) actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable (in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude non-cash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases). furthermore, fad is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. fad is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to fad and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

_______________________________________
(1)   for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" section below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares ("eps") decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in net income from discontinued operations due to the spin-off of qcp on october 31, 2016;
•   a loss on debt extinguishment in july 2017, representing a premium for early payment on the repurchase of our senior notes;
•   a reduction in rental and related revenues primarily as a result of assets sold during 2017, including the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets in the first quarter of 2017;
•   a reduction in noi primarily related to the net impact of the brookdale transaction during the fourth quarter of 2017;
•   a reduction in earnings due to the partial sale and deconsolidation of ridea ii during the first quarter of 2017;
•   impairments related to: (i) our mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care (the "tandem mezzanine loan") and (ii) 11 underperforming senior housing triple-net facilities in the third quarter of 2017;
•   increased litigation-related costs, including costs from securities class action litigation, and a legal settlement in 2017;
•   casualty-related charges due to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017; and
42
•   a reduction in interest income due to (i) the payoffs of our hc-one facility in june 2017 and a participating development loan during the third quarter of 2016 and (ii) decreased interest received from our tandem mezzanine loan during the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by additional interest income in 2017 from our $131 million loan to maria mallaband in november 2016.
the decrease in eps was partially offset by:
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017;
•   a reduction in severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former president and chief executive officer ("ceo") in 2016 compared to severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former executive vice president and chief accounting officer ("cao") in 2017;
•   a larger net gain on sales of real estate during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily related to the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets and the partial sale of ridea ii during 2017;
•   an increase in income tax benefit primarily from real estate dispositions during 2017, partially offset by an income tax expense related to the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017; and
•   an increase in other income, net primarily related to the gain on sale of our four seasons investments during 2017.
ffo decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting eps, except for gain on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate, which are excluded from ffo.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in net income from discontinued operations due to the spin-off of qcp on october 31, 2016;
•   a reduction in rental and related revenues primarily as a result of assets sold during 2017, including the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets;
•   a reduction in earnings due to the partial sale and deconsolidation of ridea ii during the first quarter of 2017; and
•   a reduction in interest income due to (i) the payoffs of our hc-one facility in june 2017 and a participating development loan during the third quarter of 2016 and (ii) decreased interest received from our tandem mezzanine loan during the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by additional interest income in 2017 from our $131 million loan to maria mallaband in november 2016.
the decrease in ffo as adjusted was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017.
fad decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, (i) increased leasing costs and tenant capital improvements and (ii) decreased installment payments received from brookdale for 2014 lease terminations that were paid over a period of three years and concluded in 2017.

eps increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   impairment charges during 2015, not repeated in 2016;
43
•   increased noi from: (i) our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent escalations and (iii) developments placed in service;
•   increased gain on sales of real estate due to a higher volume of disposition activity during 2016;
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments during 2015 and 2016; and
•   a net termination fee expense recognized in 2015, not repeated in 2016.
the increase in eps was partially offset by following:
•   a reduction in income from our hcr manor care, inc. ("hcrmc") investments as a result of: (i) the hcrmc lease amendment effective april 1, 2015, (ii) the sale of non-strategic assets during the second half of 2015 and 2016, and (iii) a change in income recognition to a cash basis method beginning in january 2016;
•   the impact from the spin-off of qcp resulting in: (i) increased transaction costs and (ii) loss on debt extinguishment, representing penalties on the prepayment of debt using proceeds from the spin-off;
•   increased income tax expense related to our estimated exposure to state built-in gain tax;
•   a reduction in interest income from placing our four seasons notes on cost recovery status in the third quarter of 2015 and loan repayments during 2015 and 2016;
•   increased severance-related charges during 2016 primarily related to the departure of our former ceo in july 2016;
•   increased depreciation and amortization from our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions; and
•   a reduction of foreign currency remeasurement gains recognized as a result of effective hedges designated in september 2015.
ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting eps, except for depreciation and amortization and gain on sales of real estate, which are excluded from ffo.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in income from our hcrmc investments as a result of: (i) the hcrmc lease amendment effective april 1, 2015, (ii) the sale of non-strategic assets during the second half of 2015 and 2016 and (iii) a change in income recognition to a cash basis method beginning in january 2016;
•   decreased income from the qcp assets included in the spin-off; and
•   a reduction in interest income from placing our four seasons notes on cost recovery status in the third quarter of 2015 and loan repayments during 2015 and 2016.
the decrease in ffo as adjusted was partially offset by the following:
•   increased noi from: (i) our 2015 and 2016 consolidated acquisitions, (ii) annual rent escalations and (iii) developments placed in service; and
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments during 2015 and 2016.

the decrease in fad was partially offset by the following:
•   increased noi from: (i) our 2015 and 2016 consolidated acquisitions, (ii) annual rent escalations and (iii) developments placed in service; and
•   increased incremental interest income from the payoff of participating development loans.

(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed four senior housing triple-net properties that were sold, 25 senior housing triple-net properties that were transitioned to our shop segment and two senior housing triple-net properties that were classified as held for sale. our 2016 total portfolio property count has been adjusted to include 64 properties classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2016.
(3)   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the 12-month period and a quarter in arrears from the periods presented.
spp noi decreased primarily as a result of the net impact of triple-net lease terminations from the brookdale transaction during the fourth quarter of 2017.
spp adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   annual rent escalations; and
•   higher cash rent received from our portfolio of assets leased to sunrise senior living.
additionally, total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following non-spp impacts:
•   senior housing triple-net facilities sold during 2016 and 2017; and
•   the transfer of 42 senior housing triple-net facilities to our shop segment.
the decrease to total portfolio noi and adjusted noi is partially offset by (i) increased non-spp income from five senior housing triple-net facilities acquired in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) the aforementioned increases to spp adjusted noi.

•   decreased non-spp income from our partial sale of ridea ii; partially offset by
•   non-spp income for 42 senior housing triple-net assets transferred to shop during the fourth quarter of 2016 and year-to-date 2017.

_______________________________________
(1)   from our 2015 presentation of spp, we removed two shop properties that were sold and a shop property that was classified as held for sale. our 2016 and 2015 total portfolio property count has been adjusted to include a property classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.
(2)   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the 12-month period and a quarter in arrears from the periods presented.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of increased occupancy and rates for resident fees and services.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to spp along with 2015 acquisitions, primarily our ridea iii acquisition. the increase in total portfolio noi was partially offset by a termination fee related to our ridea iii acquisition, which was not repeated in 2016.

(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed one life science facility that was sold and four life science facilities that were classified as held for sale. our 2016 total portfolio property count has been adjusted to include eight properties in development and four properties classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2016.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   mark-to-market lease renewals;
•   new leasing activity; and
•   specific to adjusted noi, annual rent escalations.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following impacts to non-spp:
•   decreased income from the sale of life science facilities in 2016 and 2017; partially offset by
•   increased income from (i) increased occupancy in portions of developments placed in operations in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) life science acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.
the decrease in total portfolio noi and adjusted noi was also partially offset by the aforementioned increases to spp.

(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed four mobs that were sold and two mobs that were placed into redevelopment. our 2016 total portfolio property count has been adjusted to include four properties in development as of december 31, 2016.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of mark-to-market lease renewals and new leasing activity. additionally, spp adjusted noi increased as a result of annual rent escalations.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to spp and the following impacts to non-spp:
•   increased income from our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions; and
•   increased occupancy in former redevelopment and development properties that have been placed into operations; partially offset by
•   decreased income from the sale of seven mobs during 2016 and 2017 and the placement of a mob into redevelopment.

interest income. the decrease in interest income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of: (i) the payoff of our hc-one facility in june 2017, (ii) incremental interest income received during the second quarter of 2016 due to the payoff of three participating development loans, and (iii) decreased interest received from our tandem mezzanine loan during the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by additional interest income in 2017 from our $131 million loan to maria mallaband in november 2016.
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of: (i) placing our four seasons notes on cost recovery status in the third quarter of 2015 and (ii) paydowns in our loan portfolio. the decrease in interest income was partially offset by additional interest income from: (i) the four seasons senior secured term loan purchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 and (ii) additional fundings in our loan portfolio, including our £105 million ($131 million) loan to maria mallaband in november 2016.
interest expense. the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt repayments, which occurred primarily in the second half of 2016 and throughout 2017.
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of: (i) mortgage debt repayments during 2015 and 2016, primarily from mortgage debt secured by properties in our senior housing triple-net, life science and medical office segments, (ii) senior unsecured notes payoffs during 2015 and 2016 and higher capitalized interest. the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by: (i) senior unsecured notes issued during 2015 and (ii) increased borrowings under our facility.
approximately 84%, 83% and 96% of our total debt, inclusive of $44 million, $46 million and $71 million of variable rate debt swapped to fixed through interest rate swaps, was fixed rate debt as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. at december 31, 2017, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.19% and 2.56%, respectively. at december 31, 2016, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.26% and 2.23%, respectively. at december 31, 2015, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.68% and 1.72%, respectively. for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 3 below.
depreciation and amortization. the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily as a result of the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets and the deconsolidation of ridea ii during the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of assets acquired and placed in service during 2016 and 2017.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of the impact of acquisitions primarily in our shop and medical office segments.
53
general and administrative expenses. the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily as a result of severance and related charges primarily resulting from the departure of our former president and ceo in the third quarter of 2016 which exceeded severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former cao in the third quarter of 2017.
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of: (i) higher severance-related charges primarily resulting from the departure of our former president and ceo in the third quarter of 2016 and (ii) higher professional fees in 2016, partially offset by lower compensation related expenses.
we expect to record severance and related charges of approximately $9 million in the first quarter of 2018 related to the previously announced departure of our executive chairman, effective march 1, 2018.
transaction costs. the decrease in transaction costs for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily a result of lower levels of transactional activity in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
impairments (recoveries), net.  during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized (i) $144 million of impairments on our tandem mezzanine loan due to a variety of factors including recent operating results of the underlying collateral and events of default under the loan agreement (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information) and (ii) $23 million of impairments on 11 underperforming senior housing triple-net facilities.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, there were no impairments recognized.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized the following impairment charges: (i) $112 million related to our investment in four seasons notes and (ii) $3 million related to a mob. the impairment charges were partially offset by a $6 million impairment recovery related to the repayment of a loan.
gain (loss) on sales of real estate, net.  during the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold 68 senior housing triple-net assets for $1.152 billion, five life science facilities for $81 million, five shop facilities for $43 million, four mobs for $15 million and a 40% interest in ridea ii and recognized total net gain on sales of real estate of $357 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we sold a portfolio of five facilities in one of our non-reportable segments and two senior housing triple-net facilities for $130 million, five life science facilities for $386 million, seven senior housing triple-net facilities for $88 million, three mobs for $20 million and three shop facilities for $41 million, recognizing total gain on sales of $165 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we sold the following assets: (i) nine senior housing triple-net facilities for $60 million, resulting from brookdale's exercise of its purchase option, and (ii) a mob for $0.4 million, recognizing total gain on sales of $6 million.
loss on debt extinguishments. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we repurchased $500 million of our 5.375% senior notes due 2021 and recognized a $54 million loss on debt extinguishment, primarily related to a premium for early payment.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, using proceeds from the spin-off, we repaid $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes that were due to mature in january 2017 and january 2018 and repaid $108 million of mortgage debt, incurring aggregate loss on debt extinguishments of $46 million, primarily related to prepayment penalties.
other income (expense), net. the increase in other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily as a result of the £42 million ($51 million) gain on sale of our four seasons notes, partially offset by $12 million of casualty-related charges due to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017 and $13 million of increased litigation-related expenses, including costs from securities class action litigation, and a legal settlement in 2017.
the decrease in other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of a reduction of foreign currency remeasurement gains from remeasuring assets and liabilities denominated in gbp to u.s. dollars ("usd") as a result of effective hedges designated in september 2015.
income tax benefit (expense). the increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of: (i) a $6 million income tax benefit from the partial sale of ridea ii in 2017, (ii) a $5 million income tax benefit related to our share of operating losses from our ridea joint ventures, (iii) a $1 million deferred tax benefit from casualty-related charges recognized in the second half of 2017 and (iv) a $11 million income tax expense recognized in 2016 associated with federal income tax and state built-in gain tax for the disposition of certain real estate assets. the total tax benefit was partially offset by a $17 million income tax expense related to the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017.
54
the increase in income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of recognizing tax liabilities representing state built-in gain tax for the disposition of certain real estate assets.
equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures. the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of income from our share of gains on sales of real estate in 2016, partially offset by income from our investment in ridea ii, which was deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2017.
the increase in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of increased income from our share of gains on sales of real estate.
total discontinued operations. discontinued operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 resulted in income of $266 million and loss of $699 million, respectively. income and loss from discontinued operations primarily relates to the operations of qcp. income from discontinued operations increased during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of impairment charges during 2015 not repeated in 2016. the increase in discontinued operations was partially offset by the following: (i) a reduction in income from our hcrmc investments as a result of the hcrmc lease amendment effective april 1, 2015, the sale of non-strategic assets during the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, and a change in income recognition to a cash basis method beginning in january 2016, (ii) transaction costs of $87 million related to the spin-off and (iii) increased income tax expense related to our estimated exposure to state built-in gain tax. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized impairments of $1.3 billion related to our hcrmc portfolio. there were no discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2017.
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements, including principal payments and maturities; and (iii) satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members.
our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•   fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; and
•   fund future acquisition, transactional and development activities.
we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following:
•   issuance of common or preferred stock;
•   issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt;
•   draws on our credit facilities; and/or
•   sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.
access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. for example, our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of january 31, 2018, we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch, baa2 from moody's and bbb from s&p global on our senior unsecured debt securities.
cash flow summary during the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2016-18, restricted cash and asu no. 2016-15, classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments using the full retrospective approach. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.

operating cash flow decreased $367 million between the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 primarily as the result of: (i) decreased adjusted noi related to the qcp spin-off and dispositions in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) decreased interest received as a result of loan repayments during 2016 and 2017; partially offset by (i) 2016 and 2017 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) and decreased interest paid as a result of lower balances on our senior unsecured notes and term loans. our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors.
operating cash flow decreased $8 million between the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily as the result of: (i) decreased adjusted noi related to the qcp spin-off and dispositions in 2015 and 2016 and (ii) decreased interest received as a result of loan repayments during 2016; partially offset by (i) 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) and decreased interest paid as a result of lower balances on our senior unsecured notes and term loans.

debt see note 10 in the consolidated financial statements for information about our outstanding debt.
see "2017 transaction overview" for further information regarding our significant financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2017.
equity at december 31, 2017, we had 469 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled $5.6 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $12.4 billion.
at december 31, 2017, non-managing members held an aggregate of 4 million units in five limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).
at-the-market program. in june 2015, we established an at-the-market program, in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement. under this program, we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals. there was no activity during the year ended december 31, 2017 and, as of december 31, 2017, shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of $676 million were available for sale under the at-the-market program. actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under our program.
shelf registration we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s-3asr, using a shelf registration process. our current shelf registration statement expires in june 2018. we expect to file a new shelf registration statement on or before such time. under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. the securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. in addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under "contractual obligations".
inflation our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the consumer price index or other measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. substantially all of our senior housing, life science, and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. we consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("vies") when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie. a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie.
we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether: (i) the equity investors as a group, do not have a controlling financial interest, (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (iii) substantially all of the entity's activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights. we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. when we perform a re-analysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie. we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides. if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, it may adversely impact the quality and/or timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting.
revenue recognition at the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) is equal to 90% or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset. if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl. if the assumptions utilized in the above classifications assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. if the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. when we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased
61
asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment. if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and, to a certain extent, is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. for straight-line rent receivable amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. these estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls. for leases accounted for as dfls, the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties, less the unamortized unearned income. unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment. if these assessments were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
loans receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. we recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans. if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as held-for-investment, the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted.
loans receivable and dfls (collectively, "finance receivables"), are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing, watch list or workout. finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations, and collection and timing, of all amounts owed is reasonably assured. watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout. workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined, based on current information and events, that: (i) it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement, (ii) the tenant, operator, or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and (iii) we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment.
finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured (the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout). further, we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant's, operator's, borrower's and/or guarantor's repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values. we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting: (i) if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable, net of associated allowances or charge-offs (if any), or (ii) we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable. for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received, excluding principal paydowns, to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms. for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment. generally, we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured.
allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses, if they are determined to be impaired. finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's or borrower's overall financial condition, economic resources, payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the net realizable value of any collateral. these estimates consider all

available evidence, including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible, the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.
a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, but at least annually. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment. this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets, future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate and allocate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based upon the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture. if an equity method investment shows indicators of impairment, we compare the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is other-than-temporary involves significant judgment. our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, severity and duration of a fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.

income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements. our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a reit, (iii) the potential for built-in gain recognition, and (iv) changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision.

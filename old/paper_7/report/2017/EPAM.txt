the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2017 were as follows:
•   we recorded revenues of $1.45 billion, or a 25.0% increase from $1.16 billion last year.
•   income from operations grew 29.4% to $172.9 million from $133.7 million in 2016. expressed as a percentage of revenues, income from operations was 11.9% compared to 11.5% last year. the slight increase was primarily driven by improvements in utilization.
•   our effective tax rate was 58.3% compared to 21.5% last year. this increase is principally due to the provisional $74.6 million charge related to u.s. tax reform in 2017.
26
•   net income decreased 26.7% to $72.8 million compared to $99.3 million in 2016. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income decreased 3.6% compared to last year, which was largely driven by the higher effective tax rate in 2017.
•   diluted earnings per share decreased 29.4% to $1.32 for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $1.87 in 2016.
•   cash provided by operations increased $30.5 million, or 18.5%, to $195.4 million during 2017.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report.
revenues - we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. if there is uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. at the time revenues are recognized, we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly. we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned. such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods. unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our it professionals. contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements.
the majority of our revenues (90.3% of revenues in 2017, 88.2% in 2016 and 85.8% in 2015) are generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues. the majority of such revenues are billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates by which actual time incurred is charged directly to the client. we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.
27
revenues from fixed-price contracts (8.3% of revenues in 2017, 10.4% in 2016 and 12.8% in 2015) include fixed-price maintenance and support arrangements, which may exceed one year in duration, as well as fixed-price application development arrangements. revenues from maintenance and support arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the expected service period. revenues from fixed-price application development arrangements are determined using the proportional performance method. in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the client, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could affect the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
business combinations - we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805, "business combinations." we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain.
if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
goodwill and other intangible assets - we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 31st, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. effective january 1, 2017, we early-adopted asu 2017-04 which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill when measuring an impairment. as a result, when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a two-step process. the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. in performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of a reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. an impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
historically, a significant portion of the purchase consideration related to our acquisitions was allocated to customer relationships. in valuing customer relationships, we typically utilize the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only. we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives on a straight-line basis or, if reliably determinable, the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows. amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that predominantly range from five to ten years. we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. in assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
28
accounting for income taxes - we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. we estimate separately our deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the u.s. internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions.
the provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. if the allowance is reversed in a future period, the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.
on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act ("u.s. tax act"). the u.s. tax act significantly changes u.s. corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective january 1, 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax. in addition, the tax act creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion anti-abuse tax, respectively.
due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the u.s. tax act, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31, 2017. as we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the u.s. tax act and any additional guidance issued by the u.s treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies, and further refine our calculations, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded. we will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending in the second half of 2018. any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in the provision for income taxes in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
stock-based compensation - stock-based compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-classified share-based awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, which is expensed over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately.
adjusting stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures requires judgment. if we change our assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past.
stock-based compensation expense in a period could be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures. if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unvested stock-based compensation expense.
equity-based awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period. future stock-based compensation expense related to our liability-classified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock, adding to the volatility in our operating results.
our adoption of asu 2016-09 effective january 1, 2017 increased income tax expense volatility. our future operating results will depend on the fluctuations in the stock price on the dates the awards vest or options are exercised and the magnitude of transactions occurring in each reporting period, among other factors.

change in presentation of certain financial information - as part of our discussion and analysis, we analyze revenues by client location and by vertical. prior to the first quarter of 2017, management did not include reimbursable expenses and other revenues in its discussion of revenue performance across locations and verticals. effective in the first quarter of 2017, we have allocated reimbursable expenses and other revenues (which primarily include travel and entertainment costs chargeable to clients) to corresponding geographies and verticals. we believe this change allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals and geographies by streamlining the presentation of revenues, both internally and externally, using a standardized approach. these changes did not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively beginning on january 1, 2015. comparative information for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the following tables:

revenues our revenues are derived primarily from providing software development services to our clients. revenues include revenue from services as well as license revenues, reimbursable expenses and other revenues.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, our revenues were $1.45 billion, growing 25.0% over last year. total revenues in 2017 and 2016 included $17.1 million and $12.5 million of reimbursable expenses and other revenues, respectively, which increased 36.9% in 2017 as compared to 2016, but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues. growth in revenue is attributable to both the expansion of existing business with current clients and deeper penetration into verticals where we have an established and increasing presence.
during 2016, our revenues grew 26.9% over 2015, from $914.1 million to $1.16 billion. total revenues in 2016 and 2015 included $12.5 million and $9.5 million of reimbursable expenses and other revenues, respectively, which increased by 31.6% in 2016 as compared to 2015, but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues.
we discuss below the breakdown of our revenue by client location, service offering, vertical, contract type, and client concentration.
revenues by vertical we analyze our revenue by separating our clients into five main industry sectors, or verticals, as detailed in the following table. also, we serve clients in other industries such as oil and gas, telecommunications and several others, which are reported in the aggregate under emerging verticals.
prior to the first quarter of 2017, we did not include reimbursable expenses and other revenues in our revenue results across locations and verticals. effective in the first quarter of 2017, we have allocated reimbursable expenses and other revenues (which primarily include travel and entertainment costs chargeable to clients) to corresponding geographies and verticals. we believe this change allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals and geographies by streamlining the presentation of revenues, both internally and externally, using a standardized approach. these changes did not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively effective january 1, 2015. our revenues by vertical and as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented are as follows:

revenues by client location our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets: north america, europe, cis, and apac. we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. revenue by client location is different from the revenue by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients, but instead they are based on the location of the company's management responsible for a particular client.

2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, revenues in our largest geography, north america, closed at $840.7 million growing $170.1 million, or 25.4%, from $670.6 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2016. revenues from this geography accounted for 58.0% of total revenues in 2017, a level consistent with the prior year.
within north america, we experienced strong growth across all verticals with the media and entertainment vertical contributing 31.7% of total growth in the north american geography. in addition, our traditionally strong software & hi-tech portfolio grew 19.6% year over year. we saw continued growth in emerging verticals with 44.2% growth in revenues with 29.7% of the growth coming from customers who have been with us less than one year.
revenues in our europe geography were $511.3 million, an increase of $93.5 million, or 22.4% over $417.8 million last year. revenues in this geography accounted for 35.2% of consolidated revenues in 2017 as compared to 36.0% last year. europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment, life sciences and healthcare, and emerging verticals, each of which grew over 55% during 2017. over 70% of the growth in our europe geography in 2017 came from customers who have been with us less than two years. financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography accounting for 41.1% of the europe geography's revenues in 2017 as compared to 47.7% in 2016.
revenues in the cis geography increased $22.3 million, or 48.3%, from last year. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and emerging verticals. revenues in this geography benefited by $5.9 million from the appreciation of the russian ruble relative to the u.s. dollar.
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, revenues in our largest geography, north america, closed at $670.6 million growing $180.3 million, or 36.8%, from $490.3 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2015. revenues from this geography accounted for 57.8% of total revenues in 2016, an increase of 4.2% from 53.6% reported in 2015.
within north america, we experienced strong growth across all verticals despite considerable market, geo-political, and economic uncertainties: each of the two verticals, media and entertainment and life sciences and healthcare, grew above 40%; while emerging verticals and financial services grew 59.6% and 94.9%, respectively. in addition, our traditionally strong software & hi-tech portfolio grew 27.3%, which allowed us to keep this important segment at our strategic target of 20% of consolidated revenues.
we saw continued traction with customers in the pharmaceutical segment of our life sciences and healthcare vertical, and significantly grew our portfolio of customers in emerging verticals with over 30% growth in revenues there coming from customers who have been with us less than one year. combined growth in our software & hi-tech and media & entertainment verticals accounted for 48.6% of the overall growth in the north america geography, of which $19.6 million, or 22.4%, was attributable to the expansion of existing relationship with certain long-standing customers within our media and entertainment vertical.
33
revenues in our europe geography were $417.8 million, an increase of $61.3 million, or 17.2% over $356.5 million reported in 2015. revenues in this geography accounted for 36.0% of consolidated revenues in 2016 as compared to 39.0% in 2015. the slowdown in revenue growth in 2016 was largely attributable to decelerated growth in revenues from our top customer in this geography, coupled with increased internal and external pressures on customers within our travel and consumer vertical, and currency headwinds, primarily due to the depreciation of the british pound relative to the u.s. dollar.
consistent with results in our north america geography, europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment, life sciences and healthcare, and emerging verticals, each of which grew over 48% during 2016. over 40% of growth in life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals came from customers who have been with us less than one year. financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography and accounted for 34.0% of the overall growth in 2016.
revenues in the cis geography showed an increase of $3.0 million, or 6.9%, from 2015. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and travel and consumer verticals.
revenues by client concentration while we seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements, we expect client concentration from our top clients to continue to decrease over the long-term. the following table sets forth revenues including reimbursable expenses contributed by our top one, top five, top ten and top twenty clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

(1)   no single client comprises more than 10% of the company's revenues including reimbursable expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, our revenue growth outside the top twenty accounts was $204,587 or 34.3%.
we have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multi-year projects. our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 94.9% and 85.7% of our revenues in 2017 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years, respectively. while we believe there's a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within specific domains and verticals, we continue to focus on diversification of our client concentration and building up a portfolio of accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential. we anticipate the contribution of these accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid- to long-term and offset the slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature.

revenues by contract type our engagement models are based on the type of services provided to a client, the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve. our two types of service arrangements are time-and-material and fixed-price contracts. historically, the majority of our revenues have been generated under time-and-material contracts and we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.
under time-and-material contracts, we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly, daily or monthly rates. fixed-price contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on agreed intervals.
the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation expense, project related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to client projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our revenue generating professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing client services during a given period. our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs.
we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects. some of our it professionals are hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services.
35
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $921.4 million, representing an increase of 25.0% from $737.2 million reported last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 15.0% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year as well as a 2.3% impact from appreciation of foreign currencies.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 63.5% and 63.6% during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our utilization in 2017 improved by 3.8% as compared to 2016 which was offset by higher compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of appreciation of the russian ruble, hungarian forint and polish zloty as compared to the u.s. dollar.
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $737.2 million, representing an increase of 30.0% from $566.9 million reported in 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 34.2% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 63.6% and 62.0% during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of this increase, 1.5% was attributable to a decrease in utilization during the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business. these expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation expense, commissions, travel, legal and audit services, insurance, operating leases, advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hi-tech park.
2017 compared to 2016
as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth, our selling, general and administrative expenses have been increasing. during the year ended december 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses were $324.9 million, representing an increase of 22.7% as compared to $264.7 million reported last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 was driven by a $27.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, a $16.6 increase related to investments in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount, and $7.0 million of higher spending related to talent acquisition and development.
expressed as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4% to 22.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues over time.
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $264.7 million, representing an increase of 18.8% as compared to $222.8 million reported in 2015. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily driven by a $14.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, coupled with a $16.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to investments in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount, and $4.0 million higher spending related to talent acquisition and development.
expressed as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.6% to 22.8% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily attributable to higher revenue growth as compared to the growth in compensation driven by the increased headcount and wage inflation, coupled with relatively limited growth in stock-based compensation.
36
depreciation and amortization expense
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense was $28.6 million, representing an increase of $5.2 million from $23.4 million reported last year. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth. depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense was $23.4 million, representing an increase of $6.0 million from $17.4 million reported in 2015. the increase was predominantly driven by depreciation of computer equipment and infrastructure related to increased headcount and amortization of intangible assets purchased with the acquisitions of businesses completed in 2015. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.0%, a slight increase from 1.9% reported in the same period in 2015.
other operating expenses, net there were no material changes in other operating expenses, net during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net is comprised of interest earned on cash accounts in belarus, interest earned on employee housing loans, and other income and is partially offset by interest expense related to our revolving credit facility. there were no material changes in interest and other income, net in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015.
provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances, if any, involves judgment. as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had $180.9 million, $135.8 million and $113.8 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest expense. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
in belarus, member technology companies of high-technologies park have a full exemption from belarus income tax. this tax holiday was recently extended through january 2049. the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated $15.5 million, $13.6 million and $20.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated $0.28, $0.26 and $0.40 for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
as we continue to grow our onsite presence and expand the geographic footprint of our delivery centers, this may result in volatility in our effective tax rate. other factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall effective tax rate in 2018 and beyond must be considered as well. these factors include statutory tax rate changes in the countries that are part of our geographic footprint and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards.
37
2017 compared to 2016
the provision for income taxes was $101.5 million in 2017 and $27.2 million in 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate from 21.5% in 2016 to 58.3% in 2017 was primarily due to a provisional $74.6 million charge as a result of the united states tax cuts and jobs act ("u.s. tax act") enacted on december 22, 2017. the u.s. tax act significantly changes u.s. corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective january 1, 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax. in addition, the u.s. tax act creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. the charge was comprised of a $64.3 million provisional charge due to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax as well as a $10.3 million provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the u.s. tax act.
in 2017, we also reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the u.s. tax act and determined $97.0 million of our accumulated earnings in belarus are no longer indefinitely reinvested. as a result, we recorded a charge of $4.9 million in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the withholding tax that will be payable to belarus when the earnings are expatriated.
these charges were partially offset by the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 whereby excess tax benefits of $9.3 million were recognized for the year ended december 31, 2017 in the income tax provision rather than additional paid-in-capital.
other factors include changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates as well as small decreases in statutory tax rates in hungary, ukraine and the united kingdom.
2016 compared to 2015
provision for income taxes was $27.2 million in 2016 and $21.6 million in 2015. the increase in the effective tax rate from 20.4% in 2015 to 21.5% in 2016 was predominantly caused by the changes in the geographic mix of our earnings, including:
•   higher earnings attributable to our u.s. operations in 2016 driven by the growth in onsite presence in the u.s. and lower earnings attributable to foreign jurisdictions due to currency headwinds, among other factors;
•   changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with higher statutory income tax rates;
•   full-year impact of inclusion of operating results of ags, a 2015 acquisition with its primary delivery centers in india, which has a significantly higher tax rate.
foreign exchange gain / loss for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign exchange risk."
effects of inflation economies in cis countries, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan and ukraine, have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result negatively impact the business of our existing clients and decrease demand for our services. we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations; therefore, increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business. inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages.
while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant.
38
results by business segment our operations consist of four reportable segments: north america, europe, russia and other. there were no operations in the other segment for 2017 and 2016. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and operating profit. segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses and facilities costs. these shared expenses include delivery, recruitment and development, sales and marketing, and support functions such as it, finance, legal, and human resources. generally, shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense, e.g., recorded hours or headcount. certain expenses that are not controllable at the segment level are not allocated to specific segments.
our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client. because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. however, in some specific cases, managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region, usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team. in such cases, the client's activity would be reported through that management team's reportable segment.
segment revenues from external clients and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe, russia and other reportable segments for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

north america segment
2017 compared to 2016
north america segment revenues increased $153.9 million, or 24.0%, over last year and remained consistent at 54.8% and 55.3% of total revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively. the north america segment's operating profits increased $26.3 million, or 18.4%, as compared to 2016, to $169.3 million. north america's operating profit represented 21.3% of north america segment revenues as compared to 22.3% in 2016. the media & entertainment, financial services & emerging verticals each grew over 30% as compared to 2016 and in total represented 60.8% of the growth in north america segment revenues from 2016.
39
2016 compared to 2015
north america segment revenues were 55.3% and 51.5% of total revenues representing an increase of $170.6 million, or 36.2%, over 2015. the north america segment's operating profits increased $30.7 million, or 27.3%, as compared to 2015, to $143.0 million net operating profit. north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 22.3% of north america segment's revenues. strong performance of our north america segment was predominantly driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships across all our key verticals, as well as strong performance of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies.
europe segment our europe segment includes the business in the apac region, which is managed by the same management team.
2017 compared to 2016
europe segment revenues were $593.2 million, representing an increase of $118.2 million, or 24.9%, from last year. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, revenues from our europe segment were 40.8% and 40.9% of total segment revenues, respectively. during 2017, this segment's operating profits increased $24.5 million, or 36.3% as compared to last year, to $92.1 million net operating profit. the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and grew 5.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016. over half of the growth in the europe segment was attributable to the travel & consumer and media & entertainment verticals.
2016 compared to 2015
europe segment revenues were $475.0 million, representing an increase of $74.5 million, or 18.6%, from 2015. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, revenues from our europe segment were 40.9% and 43.8% of total segment revenues, respectively. during 2016, this segment's operating profits decreased $1.2 million, or 1.7%, as compared to 2015, to $67.5 million net operating profit.
during 2016, the segment's operating results were adversely affected by a slowdown in growth of our top customer, significantly increasing pressures on operating margins and overall profitability of the segment. in january 2017, we announced a multi-year arrangement with this customer, which extended our nine-year relationship and established a minimum revenue commitment of at least $300 million over the next three years.
the segment's operating results were adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations, and particularly, the depreciation of the british pound relative to the u.s. dollar, which is the primary currency for the majority of the delivery centers that service our u.k. accounts. the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and accounted for 30.8% of the overall growth of this segment in 2016.
russia and other segments
2017 compared to 2016
revenues from our russia reportable segment increased $19.4 million relative to 2016. operating profits of our russia segment increased $6.4 million when compared to 2016. expressed as a percentage of revenues, the russia segment's operating profits were 22.1% and 17.3% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. this growth is partially attributable to the strengthening of the russian ruble against the u.s. dollar during 2017 as compared to 2016. ongoing economic and geo-political uncertainty in this region as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble impact this segment.
2016 compared to 2015
during 2016, we completed multi-year engagements with certain customers, which significantly decreased the portfolio of accounts in our other reportable segment. as a result, managerial responsibility for the remaining accounts in the other reportable segment was transferred to our russia segment. this change does not represent a change in our reportable segments, but is rather a movement in responsibility for a number of customers, accounting for less than 1% of total segment revenue.
revenues from our russia reportable segment increased $0.7 million relative to the revenues of our russia and other segments in 2015. operating profits of our russia segment increased $2.5 million when compared to the operating profits of our russia and other segments in 2015. expressed as a percentage of the russia and other segments' revenues, operating profits were 17.3% and 11.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources capital resources historically, cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business. at december 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $582.6 million and $273.7 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and as of december 31, 2017, $433.5 million of our total cash, including time deposits and restricted cash, was held internationally. of this amount, $240.1 million was held in cis countries, and $196.7 million of this total was located in belarus. banking and other financial systems in the cis region are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets, and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured. our subsidiaries in the cis and apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
all cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states, except for $97.0 million held in belarus, are for future operating needs and we have no intention of repatriating those funds. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances and we may decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states. if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends, $324.5 million, including all of the total cash held in belarus, would be subject to foreign withholding taxes. we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic operations and obligations for the foreseeable future.
on may 24, 2017, we entered into a revolving credit facility with pnc bank, national association; pnc capital markets llc; wells fargo bank, national association; santander bank, n.a.; fifth third bank and citibank n.a. to replace the former revolving credit facility. the revolving credit facility provides for a borrowing capacity of $300.0 million with potential to increase the credit facility up to $400.0 million if certain conditions are met. the revolving credit facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on may 24, 2022. borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or, up to a maximum of $100.0 million equivalent in british pounds sterling, canadian dollars, euros or swiss francs (or other currencies as may be approved by the administrative agent and the lenders). borrowings under the 2017 credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or euro-rate plus a margin based on the company's leverage ratio. at december 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt of $25.0 million and unused letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility totaling $1.3 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under certain insurance programs and office rent, with the balance of the credit limit of $273.7 million remaining available for borrowing.
we were in compliance with all covenants in the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2017, and anticipate being in compliance with all covenants for the foreseeable future.
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility.

operating activities
2017 compared to 2016
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $30.5 million, or 18.5%, to $195.4 million, as compared to 2016 primarily driven by the $39.3 million increase in income from operations. the $74.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes had minimal impact on cash flow as it was offset by a $70.5 million increase in taxes payable primarily attributable to the u.s. tax act which are expected to be paid over the next 8 years.
2016 compared to 2015
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 increased $88.4 million, or 115.7%, to $164.8 million, as compared to 2015. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher customer collections as we made substantial progress in managing our billed and unbilled trade receivables, and decreased the ratio of billed and unbilled trade receivables to revenues over the course of 2016.
investing activities
2017 compared to 2016
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2017 was $36.2 million compared to $9.3 million used in the same period in 2016. during 2017, the investing cash outflow was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of $29.8 million and was consistent with capital expenditures of $29.3 million in 2016. our capital expenditures during 2017 were driven by our continuous investment in facilities and computer equipment to support our increased headcount. cash inflows during 2016 included a $30.0 million increase in cash upon maturity of certain time deposits, while there were no material time deposit maturities during 2017.
2016 compared to 2015
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 was $9.3 million compared to $125.5 million used in the same period in 2015. during 2016, cash spent on capital expenditures increased by $11.4 million which was more than offset by a $71.4 million decrease in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2016 and a $59.5 million increase in net cash inflows as a result of movements in restricted cash and time deposits.
financing activities
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $49.7 million, representing a $39.3 million increase from $10.5 million cash provided by financing activities in 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from increased exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans. during 2017, stock option exercises contributed $54.0 million of cash compared to $18.0 million during 2016.

2016 compared to 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.5 million, representing a $23.3 million decrease from $33.8 million cash provided by financing activities in 2015. the decrease was primarily attributable to a $45.1 million decrease related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility coupled with lower proceeds related to our long-term incentive plans. this was partially offset by lower payments of deferred consideration related to acquisitions of businesses which decreased $28.0 million in 2016 compared to last year.

(1)   we estimate our future obligations for cash-settled restricted stock units issued under our long-term incentive plan by assuming the price per share of our common stock in effect at december 31, 2017 remains constant into the future. this is an estimate and ultimate payout will vary as our stock price varies over time.
(2)   we estimate our future obligations for interest on our floating rate 2017 credit facility by assuming the weighted average interest rates in effect on each floating rate debt obligation at december 31, 2017 remain constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual rates will vary over time. in addition, for the 2017 credit facility, we assume that the balance outstanding as of december 31, 2017 remains the same for the remaining term of the agreement. the actual balance outstanding under our 2017 credit facility may fluctuate significantly in future periods, depending on the availability of cash flow from operations and future investing and financing considerations.
letters of credit at december 31, 2017, we had two irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling $1.3 million under the 2017 credit facility, which are required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies and office rent. the letters of credit expire on april 27, 2018 and august 20, 2018, respectively with a possibility of automatic extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. however, our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

executive overview we are one of the largest providers of cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solutions - including payroll, talent management, human resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. as a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their hcm needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity.
highlights from the year ended june 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") include:
•   worldwide new business bookings declined 5% from the year ended june 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016") to $1.65 billion for fiscal 2017.
•   revenue grew 6% which includes one percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our cobra and chsa businesses and foreign currency translation.
•   pre-tax margin increased approximately 130 basis points to 20.4%; adjusted ebit margin increased 30 basis points to 19.8%.
•   net earnings from continuing operations increased 16%; adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 11%.
•   diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85. adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 13% to $3.70.
•   we continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning $1.3 billion via share repurchases, and approximately $1 billion via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the 42nd consecutive year. we have fully distributed the proceeds from our fiscal 2016 debt issuance.

during fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on our global hcm strategy by investing to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for sustainable long-term growth. our robust and diverse product offerings are the result of our continued investment in product innovation and service. our results in fiscal 2017 reflect the stability of our underlying business model and our disciplined strategy for profitable growth while maintaining our focus on shareholder friendly actions.
our new business bookings were down 5% during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to high demand in fiscal 2016 for our solutions that assist our clients in complying with the affordable care act ("aca"). we remain optimistic of our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending june 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018").
the causes of our client losses and resulting impact on our revenue retention continue to be a point of internal focus. our employer services revenue retention was down 50 basis points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower retention on our legacy client platforms coupled with the anticipated loss of a large client within our former chsa business at the beginning of the fiscal year. we are seeing strong retention on our strategic platforms. we continue to upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience. we believe upgrading our clients from legacy platforms is an important aspect of our long-term strategy, giving our clients our most innovative and seamless products.
our implementation team's ability to implement our services as well as our sales force's ability to sell to clients and prospects drove revenue growth during fiscal 2017. our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of u.s. geographic regions.
during fiscal 2017, we incurred $90.0 million in charges for a previously announced multi-year service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms. in connection with this service alignment initiative, we anticipate incurring total pre-tax charges of about $30 million in the year ended june 30, 2018.
in november 2016, we completed the sale of our consumer health spending account ("chsa") and consolidated omnibus reconciliation act ("cobra") businesses which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $205 million.  this disposition, and subsequent partnership with the acquiring company, allows us to further sharpen our focus on our core capabilities while continuing to deliver a full suite of hcm solutions to current and future clients in a seamless fashion. the historical results of operations of this business are included in the employer services segment.
in january 2017, we acquired the marcus buckingham company ("tmbc"). tmbc is a provider of talent management technology, coaching, and consulting solutions. the acquisition reflects our commitment to innovation and enhances our core hcm capabilities, allowing us to deepen our offering in this critical area of talent management. the results of operations of this business will be included in the employer services segment.
we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.8 billion.
we continue to make investments in our sales force and are pleased with the operational improvements of our organization, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to support these new services and strategic platforms.  our pipeline for future new business bookings remains strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic platforms and our strong, tenured sales force. we believe that our focus on these areas will continue to drive our growth and success in the future.

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  since these adjusted financial measures and other non-gaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their u.s. gaap measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "all other interest expense" and "all other interest income."
(b) the majority of charges relating to our service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort represent severance charges. severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. unlike
26
severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to our broad-based, company-wide service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort. the fiscal 2017 workforce optimization effort adjustment totaling approximately $5 million represents a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate.
(c) the taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. the tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended june 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended june 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.
(d) the tax benefit/provision on the service alignment initiative, workforce optimization effort, and the gain on the sale of the building was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.
(e) the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.
(f) "constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. "constant dollar basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
total revenues our revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses and foreign currency translation. revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  the increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.
total expenses our total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our service alignment initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue. these increases were partially offset by the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017.
operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. peo services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  these pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million. additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our service alignment initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses.
systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.
selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort.

other income, net, increased $183.9 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the chsa and cobra businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the gain on sale of the advancedmd ("amd") business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million in fiscal 2016.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13% due to the gain on the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses as well as the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of the service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016. overall margin increased from 19.2% in fiscal 2016 to 20.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses, and operating efficiencies, partially offset by the net charges related to the service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort in fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of amd in fiscal 2016, and additional interest expense related to our september 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance in fiscal 2016.
adjusted ebit adjusted ebit excludes certain interest amounts, the gain on the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses, the impact of the charges related to the service alignment initiative and the workforce optimization effort, and the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of the amd business in fiscal 2016.
adjusted ebit increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above. overall adjusted ebit margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our service alignment initiative.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.
adjusted provision for income taxes the effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses, the impact of the charges related to the service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort, the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of the amd business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. this decrease was offset by a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.

net earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations, as reported, increased 16% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the reduction in our effective tax rate described above, when compared to fiscal 2016.
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of asu 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.
adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in adjusted ebit and reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2016.

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

total revenues in fiscal 2016 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.3 million, as compared to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015.  the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.8% to $22,418.7 million in fiscal 2016.
total expenses our total expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca. total expenses also increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our workforce optimization effort. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.
operating expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. peo services pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  these pass-through costs were $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,627.1 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $388.8 million. additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to implement and service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including products that assist with aca compliance which contributed to our strong new business bookings over the past several quarters. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.
systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 1% in fiscal 2016, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects and the impact of foreign currency translation.
29
selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  the increase was primarily related to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for our hcm products, particularly those that are designed to assist businesses in complying with the aca. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to $57.6 million of additional severance charges, of which $48.2 million relate to our workforce optimization effort, and a $10.7 million reversal of reserves in fiscal 2015 related to our former dealer services business financing arrangements which were sold to a third party. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

employer services fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
revenues employer services' revenues, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses, and foreign currency translation. revenues increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. our revenues also benefited from the impact of an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our pays per control increased 2.4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017. our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2017 decreased 50 basis points to 90.0% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the lower retention on our legacy client platforms and the anticipated loss of a large client within our former chsa business.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $202.4 million.  the increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients on growing revenues as well as investments in our sales organization, partially offset by the disposition of the chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017.
employer services' overall margin increased from 30.4% to 30.6% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. this 20 basis point increase was driven by operational efficiencies partially offset by 30 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our service alignment initiative.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
revenues employer services' revenues, as reported, increased 5% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, despite a negative impact of one percentage point from foreign currency translation. revenues increased due to new business started from new business bookings, the impact of price increases, and an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our u.s. pays per control increased 2.5% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  these increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and foreign currency translation. our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2016 decreased 100 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy platforms.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $191.8 million.  the increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients, as well as increased selling and implementation expenses due to new business bookings and associated implementation costs, including an increase in costs related to assisting our clients with aca compliance. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.
employer services' overall margin increased from 29.4% to 30.4% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. this increase is due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as well as an increase of 30 basis points from foreign currency translation, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth.

peo services fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
revenues peo services' revenues as reported increased 13% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,628.4 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2,336.3 million for fiscal year 2016 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. the increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 21% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $333.1 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $292.1 million. overall margin increased from 12.1% to 12.9% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
revenues peo services' revenues as reported increased 16% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016 and $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. the increase in revenues was due to a 13% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients, as well as higher client participation and higher benefit pass-through costs in our peo benefit offerings.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 23% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $356.5 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $320.4 million described above. overall margin increased from 11.4% to 12.1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues, and sales efficiencies.
other the primary components of "other" are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of adp indemnity, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, and the historical results of the amd business. beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our chief operating decision maker began reviewing the company's results with stock-based compensation included in the company's operating segments. this change, as well as changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations, has been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period in the table above, and did not materially affect reportable segment results.

adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business.  premiums are charged by adp indemnity to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees. the premiums charged from adp indemnity to peo services are eliminated in other. changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity and included in other.  for the fiscal years 2013 to 2017, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2017, adp indemnity paid a premium of $221.0 million to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2017 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $235.0 million in july 2017 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the year ended june 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2017 reinsurance policy.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our $9.5 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s. and canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our $9.5 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
as of june 30, 2017, cash and short-term marketable securities were $2,783.6 million, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital, which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business.
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $15,061.8 million, as well as the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,493.5 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of $1,621.8 million.
net cash flows from financing activities changed due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $14,923.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, and proceeds from our $2.0 billion september 2015 debt issuance.
we purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to $226.7 million received from the sale of notes receivable related to dealer services financing arrangements during fiscal 2015.
net cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,257.6 million and the receipt of the cdk global, inc. ("cdk") dividend during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the timing of purchases of and proceeds from corporate and client funds marketable securities of $545.7 million.
net cash flows provided by financing activities increased due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $2,728.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, proceeds from our $2.0 billion september 2015 debt issuance, a decrease in our repurchases of common stock, and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper. we purchased approximately 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016 as compared to purchases of 18.2 million shares at an average price per share of $85.28 during fiscal 2015. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
capital resources and client fund obligations in september 2015, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term financing, including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. during the majority of fiscal 2017, this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to $9.25 billion in aggregate maturity value and in june 2017, we increased our commercial paper program to $9.5 billion. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  in fiscal 2017 and 2016, our average daily borrowings were $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. the weighted average maturity of the company's commercial paper
35
during fiscal 2017 was approximately two days. at june 30, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
our u.s. and canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. for fiscal 2017 and 2016, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $274.8 million and $341.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.5 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2018 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in june 2021 and june 2022, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2017 under the credit agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.5 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, and rate reduction, secured predominately by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  we do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by federal national mortgage association as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 were $249.1 million, as compared to $165.7 million for fiscal 2016. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be about $200 million.

(1)   these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $235.0 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2018 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.5 million in fiscal 2018.
(6)   acquisition-related obligations relate to contingent consideration for a business acquisition for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2017, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2018, total $27,189.4 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $27,291.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2017.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $235.0 million in july 2017 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2018 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2017 reinsurance policy. at june 30, 2017, adp indemnity had total assets of $533.9 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $459.7 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $10.7 million and $14.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - other" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation.  as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  such risks include the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.5 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our $9.5 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a.  the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 1.6% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $11 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2018.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $6 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2018.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, and for canadian securities, dbrs. approximately 79% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2017.  in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. and canadian government or government agency securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30, 2017 or 2016.

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, new accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
revenue recognition. our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., employer services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other employer services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the company's solutions. we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers' compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes.
the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement. with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.
the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. with respect to the fees for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes, the company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.
we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
client implementation fees are charged to set clients up on our solutions and are deferred until the client has gone live and services have begun. these fees are amortized to revenue over the longer of the contractual term or expected client life, including estimated renewals of client contracts.
we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
goodwill. we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. according to asc 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the two-step impairment test. based on a qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by asc 350 would be performed.
our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2017 was performed using a qualitative approach. the qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate, the competitive environment, a decline (both absolute and relative to peers) in market-dependent multiples or metrics, any changes in the market for our services, and regulatory and political development. additionally, we assessed financial
40
performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors, such as labor or other costs, that would have a negative effect on results. the annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal 2017 have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. based on our qualitative assessment, the company has determined that goodwill is not impaired.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be "more likely than not" assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. if a tax position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. a change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $74.6 million and $27.4 million, respectively.
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $35 million in the next twelve months. audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price, and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and, therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

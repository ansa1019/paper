news and information services revenue at the news and information services segment is derived from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues. advertising revenues at the news and information services segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the companys second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the companys and/or competitors products, as well as by promotional activities.
operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions and radio sports rights. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
the news and information services segments advertising volume and rates, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the companys operating results and cash flow. the company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume and rates, circulation and paper prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. the company continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. the companys expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper. the news and information services segments products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. the success of these products also depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics.
40
the companys traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. the company is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move in advertising from print to digital. these alternative media formats could impact the companys overall performance, positively or negatively. in addition, technologies have been and will continue to be developed that allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact advertising rates or revenues.
as a multi-platform news provider, the company recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital products. technologies such as smartphones, tablets and similar devices and their related applications provide continued opportunities for the company to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes, and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumer. the company continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms.
book publishing the book publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, childrens and religious books in the u.s. and internationally. the revenues and operating results of the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. the book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. this marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms and distribution channels, and other factors. each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.
major new title releases represent a significant portion of the book publishing segments sales throughout the fiscal year. print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. in the domestic and international markets, the book publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. operating expenses for the book publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
digital real estate services the digital real estate services segment generates revenue through the sale of real estate listing products to agents, brokers and developers and display advertising on its residential real estate and commercial property sites and also licenses certain professional software products on a subscription basis. significant expenses associated with these sites and software solutions include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.
consumers are increasingly turning to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information. the digital real estate services segments success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that make its websites and mobile applications useful for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals and attractive to its advertisers.
cable network programming the cable network programming segment consists of fox sports australia and anc. fox sports australia offers the following eight channels in high definition: fox sports 501, fox sports 503, fox sports 505, fox sports 506, fox league, fox footy, fox sports more and fox sports news. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers (mainly foxtel) based on the number of subscribers.
41
fox sports australia competes primarily with espn, bein sports, the free-to-air channels and certain telecommunications companies in australia.
anc offers the following channels: sky news live, sky news business, sky news weather, sky news multiview, a-pac australias public affairs channel and sky news new zealand. anc also owns and operates the australia channel iptv service for international markets. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising.
the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations. the expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the cable network programming segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the companys local and international sports programming. other expenses include marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
other the other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate strategy and creative group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. the companys corporate strategy and creative group was formed to identify new products and services across the companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions.

revenuesrevenues decreased $153 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue decrease was mainly due to a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of $269 million, primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads, the $143 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $77 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. the revenue decrease was partially offset by the acquisitions of wireless group and arm which contributed $74 million and $61 million in revenues, respectively. the decrease in the news and information services segment was partially offset by increased revenues at the digital real estate services segment of $116 million, primarily as a result of higher revenues at both rea group and move.
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $147 million and $112 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.
operating expensesoperating expenses decreased $199 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 was mainly due to a decrease in operating expenses at the news and information services segment of $199 million,
45
primarily as a result of the impact of cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production, and distribution costs and a $74 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher costs of $75 million associated with the acquisitions of arm and wireless group. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $59 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $3 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses at the news and information services segment of $10 million, mainly due to $56 million in higher costs associated with the acquisitions of wireless group and arm, and $19 million in higher costs at news america marketing, primarily due to a $12 million increase in investment spending at checkout 51, partially offset by the $63 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the increase was also attributable to a one-time corporate charge of $11 million associated with a change in the companys executive management in february 2017. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $87 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
nam group and zillow settlements, netduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized one-time costs of approximately $280 million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims at news america marketing and a one-time gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, inc. (zillow). the gain reflects settlement proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to the national association of realtors® (nar). (see note 15commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense decreased $56 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the write-down of fixed assets at the australian newspapers in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $9 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
impairment and restructuring chargesduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company recognized total impairment charges of $785 million, primarily at news uk and news corp australia. the total charges consisted of a write-down of the companys fixed assets of $679 million, a write-down of intangible assets of $58 million and a write-down of goodwill of $48 million.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company reduced its outlook for the u.k. newspapers due to the impact of adverse print advertising and print circulation trends on the future expected performance of the business. as a result, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $360 million related to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. newspapers. the write-down was comprised of approximately $252 million related to print sites, $85 million related to printing presses and print related equipment and $23 million related to capitalized software. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 8.5% and a -1.0% long term growth rate.
during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $310 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the australian newspapers. the write-down was a result of the impact of adverse trends on the future expected performance of the australian newspapers, where revenue declines from continued weakness in the print advertising market accelerated during the second quarter. the write-down was comprised of approximately $149 million related to printing presses and print related equipment, $77 million related to facilities, $66 million related to capitalized software and $18 million related to tradenames. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 11.5% and no long-term growth.
46
in fiscal 2017, the company recorded restructuring charges of $142 million, of which $133 million related to the news and information services segment. the restructuring charges were primarily related to employee termination benefits.
in connection with a reorganization at dow jones, the company incurred $38 million of restructuring expense in fiscal 2017, which is included in the restructuring charges discussed above. the reorganization is expected to reduce the companys costs by approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018.
in fiscal 2016, the company recorded restructuring charges of $89 million, of which $79 million related to the news and information services segment. the restructuring charges were primarily related to employee termination benefits.
equity (losses) earnings of affiliatesequity (losses) earnings of affiliates decreased $325 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel to fair value and lower net income at foxtel.

(a)                                               during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized a $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel to fair value. the write-down is reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) 350, intangiblesgoodwill and other (asc 350), the company amortized $68 million and $52 million related to excess cost over the companys proportionate share of its investments underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. such amortization is reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statements of operations. (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements). the increase in amortization expense recognized by the company in fiscal 2017 resulted from a corresponding decrease in amortization expense recognized by foxtel as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, foxtel revenues increased $32 million, or 1%, as a result of the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as revenues decreased 2% in local currency due to lower subscribers. operating income decreased $20 million, primarily due to planned increases in programming spend and the lower revenues noted above, partially offset by lower depreciation costs and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. net income decreased $121 million, mainly due to $58 million in losses associated with the change in the fair value of foxtels investment in ten network holdings (ten) and losses of $53 million associated with presto, primarily resulting from foxtel managements decision to cease presto operations in january 2017. (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, foxtel was deemed to have significant influence over its investment in ten. as a result, foxtel was required to treat its investment in ten as an equity method investment. foxtel elected the fair value option under asc 825, financial instruments (asc 825) and adjusts the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period. although foxtel ceased to have significant
47
influence in ten during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it will continue to adjust the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period due to its election of the fair value option under asc 825. this adjustment will be recorded as a component of foxtels net income.

additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized impairments of $9 million on certain other equity method investments. the impairments are reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

interest, netinterest, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 decreased $4 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense associated with the rea facility. (see note 9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

(a)   the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $107 million in the year ended june 30, 2017 related to rea groups sale of its european business.
(see note 3acquisitions, disposals, and other transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

(b)   the company recorded a $29 million gain resulting from the revaluation of rea groups previously held interest in iproperty during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016. (see note 3acquisitions, disposals, and other transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

(c)                                                     the company recorded write-offs and impairments of certain investments in the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016. these write-offs and impairments were taken either as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the investee or due to an other-than-temporary impairment resulting from sustained losses and limited prospects for recovery. (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

income tax (expense) benefitthe companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 were $28 million and (5%), respectively, as compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $54 million and (30%), respectively, for fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 the company recorded a tax expense of $28 million on pre-tax loss of $615 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $139 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $1 billion, a tax expense of approximately $63 million related to the settlement of a foreign tax audit and $40 million related to the recording of valuation allowance against foreign net operating losses, offset by lower taxes on the sale of certain business assets.
48
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded a tax benefit of $54 million on pre-tax income of $181 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to certain u.s. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. this benefit was recognized in conjunction with managements plan to dispose of the companys digital education business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as the company now expects to generate sufficient u.s. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration. in addition, the effective tax rate was also impacted by the $29 million non-taxable gain resulting from the revaluation of rea groups previously held equity interest in iproperty. (see note 18income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxfor the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company did not recognize any income from discontinued operations as the operations of the digital education business were discontinued during fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $15 million. the income recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impact of a $144 million tax benefit recognized upon reclassification of the digital education segment to discontinued operations, a tax benefit of $30 million related to the operations for the period and lower operating losses as a result of the sale of amplify insight and amplify learning, which more than offset the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $76 million and $17 million in severance and lease termination charges recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. (see note 4discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
net (loss) incomenet (loss) income decreased $893 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of approximately $785 million, mainly related to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. and australian newspapers, higher equity losses of affiliates, primarily due to the $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel to fair value, the absence of the one-time gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, and the tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances and income from discontinued operations recognized in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the absence of the $280 million nam group settlement charge in the prior year and higher other, net.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $24 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due to the gain on the sale of rea groups european business.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses and excluding the impact from the nam group and zillow legal settlements. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax (expense) benefit and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
49
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net (loss) income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the companys operations and other factors that affect the companys reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods. the following table reconciles total segment ebitda to (loss) income from continuing operations:

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the news and information services segment decreased $269 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue decrease was mainly due to lower advertising revenues of $202 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads, the $33 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, the $28 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower advertising revenues of $16 million from the perth sunday times which was sold in november 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisitions of wireless group and arm, which contributed $63 million and $42 million of advertising revenues, respectively. circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 decreased $97 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the $88 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $39 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, which more than offset higher circulation and subscription revenues at dow jones. other revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 increased $30 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher brand partnership revenues in the u.k. of $14 million, higher third-party printing revenues in australia of $10 million and the acquisitions of wireless group and unruly, which contributed $11 million and $8 million, respectively, to the increase. these increases were partially offset by the $27 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $143 million and $77 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment increased $200 million, or 93%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the absence of the $280 million nam group settlement charge in the prior year and the $12 million impact of an adjustment to the deferred consideration accrual related to the acquisition of unruly. these factors were partially offset by lower contributions from news corp australia, news uk and dow jones of $44 million, $36 million and $22 million, respectively, primarily due to the impact of lower advertising revenues as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production, editorial and distribution costs.
news corp australia revenues at the australian newspapers were $1,271 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $21 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,292 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in a revenue increase of $43 million, or 3%, and a revenue decrease of $21 million, or 2%, respectively, for the

fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. advertising revenues decreased $46 million, primarily as a result of the $94 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market, lower advertising revenues of $16 million from the perth sunday times, which was sold in november 2016, and the $14 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of arm, which contributed $42 million to advertising revenues, and the $25 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. circulation and subscription revenues increased $7 million due to the $14 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and $13 million from the acquisition of arm, partially offset by lower circulation and subscription revenues of $10 million primarily from the perth sunday times and the $7 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, as price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by print volume declines. other revenues increased $18 million primarily due to higher third-party printing revenues.
news uk revenues were $1,037 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $244 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,281 million. advertising revenues decreased $114 million, primarily due to the $52 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $51 million impact from weakness in the print advertising. circulation and subscription revenues decreased $111 million, primarily due to the $96 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $13 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, as the $33 million impact of single-copy volume declines, primarily at the sun, was offset by the $32 million impact of cover price increases across the sun and the times. other revenues decreased $19 million due to the $29 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher brand partnership revenues. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $177 million and $21 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
dow jones revenues were $1,479 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $91 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,570 million. advertising revenues decreased $103 million, primarily due to the $95 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market. circulation and subscription revenues increased $9 million, primarily due to the $38 million impact of price increases and volume growth at the wall street journal, partially offset by the $19 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 and the $6 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as professional information business revenues were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016. the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in revenue decreases of $26 million and $6 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
news america marketing revenues at news america marketing were $1,021 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, an increase of $9 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,012 million. the increase was primarily due to higher other revenues of $9 million related to certain merchandising products. advertising revenues were flat, as higher domestic in-store product revenues of $42 million and certain other increases were offset by lower home delivered revenues, which include free-standing insert products, of $51 million.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the book publishing segment decreased $10 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease was mainly due to the absence of $42 million in sales of go set a watchman by harper lee, the $34 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $19 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by strong frontlist and backlist sales in the general books category, which increased $43 million, including hillbilly elegy by j.d. vance, and in the christian publishing category, which increased $24 million, including the magnolia story by chip and joanna gaines and jesus calling and jesus always by sarah young, as well as the $25 million impact of the continued expansion of harpercollins global footprint. digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 and were flat as compared to fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment increased $14 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the mix of titles as compared to the prior year.

primarily due to a $38 million increase in connectionssm for buyers product revenues and a $12 million increase in non-listing media revenues, partially offset by the $12 million impact of lower revenues from tigerlead® , which was sold in november 2016. the acquisition of diakrit also contributed $13 million to the revenue increase for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment decreased $20 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in segment ebitda was the result of the $63 million lower contribution from move, primarily due to the absence of the $122 million gain recognized in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow in fiscal 2016 and $11 million of increased marketing costs to drive traffic growth and brand awareness, partially offset by the higher revenues noted above and the absence of $36 million of legal costs, primarily related to the zillow litigation. the decrease was partially offset by the $46 million higher contribution from rea group, primarily due to the higher revenues noted above, the $11 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the absence of $12 million of costs associated with rea groups european business, which was disposed of in fiscal 2017, partially offset by $16 million in higher costs associated with higher revenues and $14 million in higher costs related to the acquisition of iproperty.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $10 million, or 2% as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue increase was primarily due to the acquisition of anc, which contributed $20 million of revenue in fiscal 2017 and the $12 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. these increases were partially offset by lower affiliate revenues of $11 million at fox sports australia and the $10 million impact of the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the cable network programming segment decreased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in segment ebitda was due to the $3 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as the impact of lower revenues at fox sports australia were offset by lower programming rights costs.

revenuesrevenues decreased $232 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was mainly due to a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of $393 million, primarily resulting from the $290 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads and lower free-standing insert product revenues at news america marketing of $98 million. the revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues at the digital real estate services segment of $197 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014 and increased revenues at rea group. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar amount against local currencies and the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue decrease of $455 million and increase of $112 million, respectively for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
operating expensesoperating expenses decreased $224 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in operating expenses at the news and information services segment of $300 million, primarily as a result of the $157 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, lower newsprint, production and distribution costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives. the decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by higher operating expenses at the digital real estate services segment of $44 million due to the acquisition of move in november 2014 and $39 million at the book publishing segment primarily due to higher costs associated with increased print book sales. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $199 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $95 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses at the digital real estate services segment of $132 million as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014 and increased costs in the news and information services segment of $16 million. the increases at the news and information services segment were primarily due to increased costs of $41 million related to the acquisition of unruly in september 2015, an approximate $40 million in increased brand marketing and promotional expenses primarily at the u.k. newspapers, and $28 million at nam primarily due to the acquisition of checkout 51 in july 2015, partially offset by the $117 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with the u.k. newspaper matters of $31 million and lower expenses at the book publishing segment of $24 million primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $186 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
nam group and zillow settlements, netduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized one-time costs of approximately $280 million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims at news america marketing. in addition, in the three months ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized a gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, which reflects settlement proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to nar. (see note 15commitments and contingences in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense increased $7 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense at the digital real estate services segment due to the acquisition of move in november 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $27 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
restructuring chargesin fiscal 2016, the company recorded restructuring charges of $89 million, of which $79 million related to the news and information services segment. the restructuring charges were primarily related to employee termination benefits.

(a)                                                    in accordance with asc 350, the company amortized $52 million and $57 million related to excess cost over the companys proportionate share of its investments underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. such amortization is reflected in equity earnings of affiliates in the statements of operations. (see note 6investments in the accompanying

56
consolidated financial statements). for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, foxtel revenues decreased $279 million, or 10%, as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher revenues in local currency. operating income decreased primarily due to the negative net impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increased investment in programming to support subscriber growth, higher offer costs and continued investment in presto, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting from foxtels reassessment of the useful lives of cable and satellite installations. net income decreased as a result of the lower operating income noted above, partially offset by lower income tax expense.

(see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

(c)                            in august 2014, rea group completed the sale of a minority interest held in marketable securities for total cash consideration of $104 million. as a result of the sale, rea group recognized a pre-tax gain of $29 million, which was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in other, net in the statement of operations.

for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2016 the company recorded a tax benefit of $54 million on pre-tax income of $181 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax. the lower tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to certain u.s. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. this benefit

was recognized in conjunction with managements plan to dispose of the companys digital education business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as the company now expects to generate sufficient u.s. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration. in addition, the effective tax rate was also impacted by the $29 million non-taxable gain resulting from the revaluation of rea groups previously held equity interest in iproperty.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, the companys effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact from foreign operations which are subject to lower tax rates, partially offset by the impact of nondeductible items and changes in our accrued liabilities for uncertain tax positions. (see note 18income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxfor the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $15 million as compared to a loss of $445 million for fiscal 2015. the income recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impact of a $144 million tax benefit recognized upon reclassification of the digital education segment to discontinued operations, a tax benefit of $30 million related to the current year operations and lower operating losses as a result of the sale of amplify insight and amplify learning, which more than offset the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $76 million and $17 million in severance and lease termination charges recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. the loss recognized in fiscal 2015 primarily relates to a non-cash impairment charge of $371 million recorded in the three months ended june 30, 2015 and a full year of operating losses at amplify in 2015. (see note 4discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
net income (loss)net income increased $328 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher income from discontinued operations and the income tax benefit discussed above, partially offset by the negative net impact of the nam group and zillow legal settlements, lower total segment ebitda, the lower contribution from other, net, lower equity earnings, primarily from foxtel, and lower interest, net.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $2 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, due to higher results at rea group, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses and the nam group and zillow settlement charge. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, equity earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax benefit (expense) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as
58
depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the companys operations and other factors that affect the companys reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods. the following table reconciles total segment ebitda to income (loss) from continuing operations.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the news and information services segment decreased $393 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was mainly due to lower advertising revenues of $353 million as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily resulting from the $152 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, weakness in the print advertising market and $98 million lower free-standing insert product revenues at news america marketing. circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 decreased $52 million as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the $109 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher paid circulation and subscription revenues at dow jones and the australian newspapers primarily resulting from price increases and digital subscriber growth. other revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 increased $12 million as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the $45 million contribution from unruly which was acquired in september 2015, partially offset by the $29 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $77 million.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment decreased $389 million, or 65%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to one-time costs of approximately $280 million recognized in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims, lower free-standing insert product revenues discussed above and a loss of $20 million at checkout 51, primarily related to investment spending and acquisition-related costs. segment ebitda was also impacted by a decrease of $27 million at the australian newspapers, primarily resulting from the $14 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower advertising revenues, which more than offset the impact of lower newsprint, production and distribution costs, and at the u.k. newspapers of $23 million, primarily due to lower revenues and higher promotion and marketing costs. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $22 million at dow jones, primarily due to lower newsprint, production and distribution costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives.
news corp australia revenues at the australian newspapers were $1,292 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, a decrease of $241 million, or 16%, as compared to fiscal 2015 revenues of $1,533 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar resulted in a revenue decrease of $194 million, or 13%. advertising revenues declined $203 million, primarily as a result of the $121 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $93 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market in australia. circulation and subscription revenues declined $43 million due to the $57 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the $18 million impact of price increases, digital subscriber growth and the positive impact of the 53rd week.

news uk revenues were $1,281 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, a decrease of $142 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,423 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the british pound resulted in a revenue decrease of $80 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. advertising revenues decreased $63 million, primarily due to the $52 million impact from print market declines and the $25 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. circulation and subscription revenues decreased $41 million due to the $42 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. lower revenues of $55 million resulting from single-copy volume declines, primarily at the sun, and changes in the digital strategy at the sun, were offset by the $53 million impact from cover price increases, higher subscriptions at the times and the sunday times and the 53rd week. other revenues decreased $38 million due to a reduction in newsprint sales to third parties.
dow jones revenues were $1,570 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $4 million, as compared to fiscal 2015 revenues of $1,566 million. circulation and subscription revenues increased by $33 million, due to higher revenues at the wall street journal of $20 million primarily related to price increases and digital volume growth and the $19 million positive impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by the $10 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. professional information business revenues were flat compared to fiscal 2015. advertising revenues decreased $27 million primarily resulting from lower print advertising of $36 million, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenues. the impact of the 53rd week resulted in a revenue increase of $7 million.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the book publishing segment decreased $21 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of $69 million in higher sales of the divergent series by veronica roth and american sniper by chris kyle in the prior year, the $39 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and an industry-wide decline in e-book sales. these decreases were partially offset by higher print book sales across all genres, including sales of go set a watchman by harper lee in fiscal 2016 of $42 million, $37 million due to strong sales in the christian publishing and childrens categories, $23 million related to the acquisition of harlequin in august 2014 and $21 million related to the continued expansion of harpercollins global footprint. the company sold 2.0 million net units of the divergent series in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to 8.3 million net units in fiscal 2015. digital sales represented 19% and 22% of consumer revenues during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. digital sales decreased 15% as compared to
61
fiscal 2015 due to an industry-wide decline in e-book sales and the lower contribution from the divergent series. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, harpercollins had 239 titles on the new york times bestseller list, with 30 titles reaching the number one position. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $19 million.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment decreased $36 million, or 16%, as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to the mix of titles as compared to the prior year and cost saving initiatives.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues at the digital real estate services segment increased $197 million, or 32%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $169 million increase from move which was acquired in november 2014. the majority of the increase related to the inclusion of a full year of operations in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. approximately $40 million of the increase related to move was driven by increased connectionsm for co-brokerage product revenues and to a lesser extent, non-listing media revenues in the period from november 2015 through the end of fiscal 2016, as compared to the comparable prior year period. at rea group, revenues increased $22 million, or 5%, to $459 million in fiscal 2016 from $437 million in fiscal 2015 resulting from higher revenues from greater residential listing depth product penetration and higher developer and media revenues, largely offset by the $66 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment increased $143 million, or 71%, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to an increase at move resulting from a gain of $122 million recognized in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow. the gain reflects proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to nar. the results at move were also positively impacted by transaction costs of $19 million in fiscal 2015 which did not recur in the current fiscal year and higher revenues, offset by increased legal costs of $28 million related to the zillow litigation. total legal costs incurred in connection with the zillow litigation were $38 million for fiscal 2016. segment ebitda was also impacted by higher revenues at rea group, noted above, which were partially offset by the $37 million negative net impact of currency fluctuations. these increases were partially offset by $7 million in one-time transaction costs related to the acquisition of iproperty.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, revenues and segment ebitda at the cable network programming segment decreased $16 million, or 3%, and $11 million, or 8%, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2015. the revenue decrease was primarily due to the $60 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher affiliate and advertising revenues of $44 million. the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $10 million. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily the result of the $14 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as higher sports programming rights and production costs offset higher affiliate and advertising revenues discussed above.

segment ebitda at the other segment for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 increased $32 million, or 15%, as compared to fiscal 2015. segment ebitda increased primarily due to $31 million lower costs associated with the u.k. newspaper matters. the net expense related to the u.k. newspaper matters included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $19 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 as compared to $50 million in fiscal 2015.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the companys principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of june 30, 2017, the companys cash and cash equivalents were $2,016 million. the company expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. as described in greater detail below, in october 2013, the company established a revolving credit facility of $650 million, which
63
terminates on october 23, 2020. the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement and may also request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million. in addition, the company expects to have access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue debt if needed or desired. although the company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the companys performance, (ii) its credit rating or absence of a credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurances that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms. see part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion.
as of june 30, 2017, the companys consolidated assets included $1,050 million in cash and cash equivalents that was held by its foreign subsidiaries. $276 million of this amount is cash not readily accessible by the company as it is held by rea group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. rea group must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea groups cash balance. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and taxes. additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company.
the principal uses of cash that affect the companys liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs and paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities and acquisitions. in addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the companys securities or the assumption of indebtedness.
issuer purchases of equity securities in may 2013, the companys board of directors (the board of directors) authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its class a common stock. on may 10, 2015, the company announced it had begun repurchasing shares of class a common stock under the stock repurchase program. no stock repurchases were made during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. through august 7, 2017, the company repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. the remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of august 7, 2017 was approximately $429 million. all decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the board of directors and management. the committees decisions regarding future stock repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. the stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the board of directors and the board of directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.
dividends in august 2016, the board of directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for class a common stock and class b common stock. this dividend was paid on october 19, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on september 14, 2016. in february 2017, the board of directors declared a semi-
64
annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for class a common stock and class b common stock. this dividend was paid on april 19, 2017 to stockholders of record as of march 15, 2017. the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the board of directors. the board of directors decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation free cash flow available to news corporation is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, less capital expenditures (free cash flow) less rea group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from rea group. free cash flow available to news corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations. free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.
the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the companys balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the companys business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period.

free cash flow available to news corporation decreased $497 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 to $113 million from $610 million in fiscal 2016. the decrease was primarily due to lower cash provided by continuing operating activities as discussed above, as well as higher rea group free cash flow.
free cash flow available to news corporation increased by $15 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 to $610 million from $595 million in fiscal 2015. the improvement was primarily due to lower capital expenditures

revolving credit facility the companys credit agreement (as amended, the credit agreement) provides for an unsecured $650 million revolving credit facility (the facility) that can be used for general corporate purposes. the facility has a sublimit of $100 million available for issuances of letters of credit. under the credit agreement, the company may request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million.
in october 2015, the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement (the amendment) which, among other things, extended the original term of the facility by two years and lowered the commitment fee payable by the company. as a result of the amendment, the lenders commitments now terminate on october 23, 2020, and any borrowings will be due at that time. the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, with customary exceptions, including limitations on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to engage in transactions with affiliates, incur liens, merge into or consolidate with any other entity, incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries. in addition, the credit agreement requires the company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. if any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. as of june 30, 2017, the company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
interest on borrowings under the facility is based on either (a) a eurodollar rate formula or (b) the base rate formula, each as set forth in the credit agreement. the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the credit agreement, which varies based on the companys adjusted operating income leverage ratio. as of june 30, 2017, the company was paying a commitment fee of 0.225% on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 0.50% for a base rate borrowing and 1.50% for a eurodollar rate borrowing.
as of the date of this filing, the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility.
rea group unsecured revolving loan facility rea group entered into an a$480 million unsecured syndicated revolving loan facility agreement in connection with the acquisition of iproperty. the rea facility consists of three sub facilities of a$120 million, a$120 million and a$240 million which become due in december 2017, december 2018 and december 2019, respectively. in february 2016, rea group drew down the full a$480 million (approximately $340 million as of such date) available under the rea facility, and the proceeds, less lenders fees of $1 million, were used to fund the iproperty acquisition. borrowings under the rea facility bear interest at a floating rate of the australian bbsy plus a margin in the range of 0.85% and 1.45% depending on rea groups net leverage ratio. as of june 30, 2017, rea group was paying a margin of between 0.85% and 1.05%. rea group paid approximately $10 million in interest for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.7%. the rea facility requires rea group to maintain a net leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. as of june 30, 2017, rea group was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
68
commitments the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (firm commitments) to make future payments. these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. the following table summarizes the companys material firm commitments as of june 30, 2017.

(a)   the company has commitments under purchase obligations related to printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.

(b)   the company has sports programming rights commitments with national rugby league, football federation australia, australian rugby union and international cricket as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2023.

(c)                    the company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants and equipment. these leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2062. this amount includes approximately $210 million of land and office facilities that have been subleased from 21st century fox.

(d)   primarily represents the rea facility based on the contractual maturity date of the various sub facilities included within the agreement. (see note
9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).

the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the companys total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.
the table also excludes the companys pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (opeb) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. the company made contributions of $26 million and $26 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $24 million in fiscal 2018, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the companys expected returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. payments due to participants under the companys pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the companys opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the companys opeb plans. the company expects its opeb payments to approximate $9 million in fiscal 2018. (see note 16retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
69
contingencies the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. (see note 15commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
the companys tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the companys tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid; however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress. as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation, the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated u.s. federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the companys domestic subsidiaries were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group. in conjunction with the separation, the company entered into the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with 21st century fox, which requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service (irs) or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the companys financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company. (see note 2summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
long-lived assets the companys long-lived assets, include goodwill, finite-lived and indefinite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar
70
economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company early adopted asu 2017-04, intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04) which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and instead requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value. under asu 2017-04, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. in performing the valuation, the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach methodologies.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.
the performance of the companys annual impairment analysis resulted in $88 million of impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2017. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 9.0%-25.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 0.0%-3.3%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.5%-7.5%). significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 10%-15%).
significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
the fair values of the companys reporting units in fiscal 2017 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 3% to 23%. no material impairments were identified. any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment failing the 2017 impairment analysis, which would have required the
71
company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value. the news and information services segment has a reporting unit with goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion at june 30, 2017 that is at-risk for future impairment. additionally, the company has certain other reporting units with goodwill balances of $83 million which are considered to be at-risk. the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.
property, plant and equipment the company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable, in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment (asc 360). an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include, among other things, material declines in operating performance, significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group.
in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group. the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance, market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset. if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be non-recoverable, the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset groups carrying value and its fair value. the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. typical assumptions applied when using a market-based approach include projected ebitda and related multiples. typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company recognized total fixed asset write-downs of $679 million, primarily at news uk and news corp australia.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company reduced its outlook for the u.k. newspapers due to the impact of adverse print advertising and print circulation trends on the future expected performance of the business. as a result, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $360 million related to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. newspapers. the write-down was comprised of approximately $252 million related to print sites, $85 million related to printing presses and print related equipment and $23 million related to capitalized software. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 8.5% and a -1.0% long term growth rate.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $310 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the australian newspapers. the write-down was a result of the impact of adverse trends on the future expected performance of the australian newspapers, where revenue declines from continued weakness in the print advertising market accelerated during the second quarter. the write-down was comprised of approximately $149 million related to printing presses and print related equipment, $77 million related to facilities, $66 million related to capitalized software and $18 million related to tradenames. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 11.5% and no long-term growth. as of june 30, 2017, the company determined that the remaining carrying value of fixed assets reviewed as part of the analysis continue to be recoverable.
72
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the companys tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740, income taxes.
the companys annual tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant management judgment is required in determining the companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the companys net deferred tax assets, if any. in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. the companys actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. although the company believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. the companys policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit (expense).
retirement benefit obligations the companys employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries. (see note 16retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap. the measurement and recognition of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. net periodic benefit costs (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolios past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 5.1% for fiscal 2018 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 22% equities, 62% fixed-income securities and 16% cash and other investments.
the company recorded $1 million, $8 million, and ($4) million in net periodic benefit costs (income) in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in fiscal 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. for fiscal 2016 and previous periods presented, the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from
73
a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. the new method utilized a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively. this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the companys pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods.
although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 3.0% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit costs (income). the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the companys annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the companys expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.
the key assumptions used in developing the companys fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:

the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 5.1% for fiscal 2018 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2017 were approximately $595 million which decreased from approximately $610 million for the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2016. this decrease of $15 million was primarily due to favorable asset returns. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the companys deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the companys accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with asc 715, compensationretirement benefits. unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.
the company made contributions of $26 million, $26 million and $9 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the
74
companys expected plan returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $24 million in fiscal 2018. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. (see note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the companys expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the companys pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
changes in assumption   impact on annual      impact on projected pension expense       benefit obligation
0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   increase $2 million   increase $87 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   decrease $2 million   decrease $79 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $3 million   
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $3 million   

the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices. the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.
the following sections provide quantitative information on the companys exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk. the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.
foreign currency rates the company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the u.s. dollar; the australian dollar; and the british pound sterling. these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the companys u.s., australian and u.k. operations, respectively. cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and u.k. foreign operations.
because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the companys reporting currency (the u.s. dollar) for consolidation purposes. the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling. as exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its statements of operations into u.s. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.
the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016:
u.s.          australian         british pound dollars             dollars              sterling fiscal year ended june 30, 2017
revenues                                                             47   %              29   %                19   %
operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses          47   %              26   %                20   %
fiscal year ended june 30, 2016
revenues                                                             47   %              28   %                20   %
operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses          48   %              24   %                21   %
based on the year ended june 30, 2017, a one cent change in each of the u.s. dollar/australian dollar and the u.s. dollar/british pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $32 million and $12 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately $6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, on an annual basis.
stock prices the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $97 million as of june 30, 2017. a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $10 million before tax. any changes in fair value of the companys common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary.

credit risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
the companys receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30, 2017 or june 30, 2016 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the companys products and services are sold.
the company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. as of june 30, 2017, the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report.
overview we are a diversified technology company. we operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017 included in this annual report.
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements.
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec. although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. if an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. at december 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $12.7 million, or 1.9% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $14.5 million, or 2.3% of total gross accounts receivable, at december 31, 2016. this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible.
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. when we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. at december 31, 2017, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $38.1 million, or 15.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $37.2 million, or 17.0% of gross inventory cost, at december 31,
18
2016. the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.
most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recognized revenue of $249 million, $241 million and $253 million, respectively, using this method. percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects. at december 31, 2017, $253 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized.
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the u.s., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. during 2017, our effective income tax rate was 6.1%, as compared to the 2016 rate of 30.0%. the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a $215 million net income tax benefit related to the tax act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016. we expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 21% and 23%.
we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).
when testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.
we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.
key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.
we have 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.3 billion. in 2017, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. we conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. we determined that
19
impairment of goodwill was not likely in 31 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units. for the remaining two reporting units, the company performed its quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of october 1, 2017.
business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. if necessary, we conduct a quantitative review using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. this methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth.
the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units. changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2017.
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $4.61 billion as compared to $3.79 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of 21.6%. the increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 16.3%, organic growth of 5.3% and no impact from foreign exchange.
in our rf technology segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased by $651.9 million or 54% over the year ended december 31, 2016. acquisitions accounted for 51% and organic revenues increased by 3%. the increase in organic revenues was due primarily to growth in our software businesses. gross margin was 61.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 56.7% for the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher gross margin. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31, 2017 increased to 35.3%, as compared to 25.9% in the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from our software businesses, which have a higher sg&a structure, including amortization of acquired intangibles. the resulting operating margin was 25.7% in 2017 as compared to 30.8% in 2016.
our medical & scientific imaging segment reported a $47.5 million or 3% increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 over the year ended december 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our medical products businesses, led by ndi, and our alternate site healthcare businesses. gross margin decreased to 72.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017 from 73.2% for the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix at both our software and medical products businesses. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 37.5% in the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to 38.2% in the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales. the resulting operating margin was 34.5% in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 35.0% in the year ended december 31, 2016.
net revenues for our industrial technology segment increased by $77.1 million or 11% for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016, all of which was attributable to organic growth. the growth in organic revenues was broad-based, due primarily to our fluid handling, water meter technology and materials testing businesses. gross margin was consistent at 50.6% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 20.6% in the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to 21.9% in the year ended december 31, 2016, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. the resulting operating margin was 30.0% in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 28.7% in the year ended december 31, 2016.
in our energy systems & controls segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased by $41.1 million or 8% from the year ended december 31, 2016. organic sales increased by 7% and the benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions totaled 1%. the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in pressure sensors and valves businesses serving energy markets as well as businesses serving industrial end markets. gross margin increased to 57.4% in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 57.1% in the year ended december 31, 2016 and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 30.0% in the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to 31.7% in the year ended december 31, 2016, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. as a result, operating margin was 27.4% in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 25.4% in the year ended december 31, 2016.
corporate expenses increased by $14.3 million to $141.8 million, or 3.1% of revenues, in 2017 as compared to $127.5 million, or 3.4% of revenues, in 2016. the dollar increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional services.
interest expense increased $69.0 million, or 61.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund acquisitions at the end of 2016.
other income, net, of $5.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 was composed primarily of a $9.4 million gain on sale of a product line in our energy systems & controls segment, offset in part by a $1.8 million charge on a minority investment and foreign exchange losses at our non-u.s. based companies. other expense of $1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-u.s. based companies, offset in part by royalty income.
during 2017, our effective income tax rate was 6.1% as compared to our 2016 rate of 30.0%. the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a $215 million net income tax benefit related to the tax act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016.
the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands). we include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months.

net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $3.79 billion as compared to $3.58 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of 5.8%. the increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 6.8%, negative organic growth of 0.3% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 0.7%.
in our rf technology segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by $176 million or 17% over the year ended december 31, 2015. acquisitions net of the divestiture of the black diamond advanced technology business added 15%, organic revenues increased by 3%, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. the increase in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our software businesses, offset in part by the completion of large service contracts in our toll and traffic businesses in 2015. gross margin was 56.7% in 2016 as compared to 53.4% in the prior year due to product mix in our toll and traffic businesses as well as an increased percentage of revenues at our software businesses which have a higher gross margin. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended december 31, 2016 increased to 25.9%, as compared to 23.3% in the prior year due primarily to an increased percentage of net revenues at our software businesses which have a higher sg&a structure. operating margin was 30.8% in 2016 as compared to 30.2% in 2015.
our medical & scientific imaging segment reported a $147 million or 12% increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 over the year ended december 31, 2015. acquisitions contributed 9%, organic revenues increased 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. the increase in organic revenues was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by ndi and verathon. gross margin decreased to 73.2% in the year ended december 31, 2016 from 74.0% in the year ended december 31, 2015, due primarily to product mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 38.2% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 37.7% in the year ended december 31, 2015, due to a higher sg&a structure in our medical businesses. operating margin was 35.0% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 36.4% in the year ended december 31, 2015.
net revenues for our industrial technology segment decreased by $39 million or 5.2% for the year ended december 31, 2016 from the year ended december 31, 2015. the divestiture of the abel pumps business in 2015 accounted for a negative 3.1%, organic revenues decreased by 1.5% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 0.6%. the decrease in organic revenues was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets, offset in part by increased sales in our water metering business. gross margin increased to 50.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 49.8% in the year ended december 31, 2015 due to product mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 21.9%, as compared to 21.0% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume. the resulting operating margin was 28.7% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 28.8% in the year ended december 31, 2015.
in our energy systems & controls segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by $78 million or 13% from the year ended december 31, 2015. organic revenues decreased by 12% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. gross margin decreased to 57.1% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 58.1% in the year ended december 31, 2015 and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 31.7% as compared to 30.5% in the prior year, both of which were due to negative leverage on lower sales volume. operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 27.6% in the year ended december 31, 2015.
corporate expenses increased by $24.7 million to $127.5 million, or 3.4% of net revenues, in 2016 as compared to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of net revenues, in 2015. the increase was due primarily to increased equity compensation costs as a result of both an increase in the number of shares granted in the current year and increases in our common stock price and increased costs related to acquisitions.
interest expense increased $27.3 million, or 32.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund current year acquisitions as well as higher average interest rates throughout 2016.
23
other expense of $1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-u.s. based companies, offset in part by royalty income. other income of $58.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of abel pumps (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment.
during 2016, our effective income tax rate was 30.0%, which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 30.6%. the decrease was due to the recognition of $15.3 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an asu related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), as well as the non-recurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015.
the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands). we include in backlog only orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources selected cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in millions):
2017                                          2016                             2015
cash provided by/(used in):
operating activities             $1,234                $964                $929
investing activities               (210   )          (3,753   )          (1,698   )
financing activities             (1,170   )           2,805                 996
operating activities - the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 and in 2016 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash expenses and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was offset in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the abel pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
investing activities - cash used in investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was primarily for business acquisitions. cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the abel pumps business.
financing activities - cash used in/provided by financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments/borrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders. cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $660 million and the repayment of $400 million of senior notes. cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions.
cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2017 by $59 million as compared to decreases during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 of $38 million and $59 million, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 was due primarily to the strengthening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the u.s. dollar, while the decreases for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to the weakening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the u.s. dollar.
net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was a negative $140 million at december 31, 2017 compared to negative $25 million at december 31, 2016, due primarily to increased deferred revenues. this deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services along with the impact of fair value purchase accounting resulting from 2016 acquisitions.
24
total debt was $5.2 billion at december 31, 2017 (43.0% of total capital) compared to $6.2 billion at december 31, 2016 (51.8% of total capital). our decreased debt at december 31, 2017 compared to december 31, 2016 was due primarily to the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $660 million and the repayment of $400 million of senior notes.
on september 23, 2016, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit facility (the "2016 facility") with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of july 27, 2012, as amended as of october 28, 2015 (the "2012 facility"). the 2016 facility comprises a five year $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150 million for letters of credit. we may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500 million.
the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1.
on december 2, 2016, we amended the 2016 facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility, to 4.0 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment, 4.25 to 1).  in conjunction with the deltek acquistion (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through june 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through december 31, 2017.
at december 31, 2017, we had $3.9 billion of senior unsecured notes and $1.3 billion of outstanding revolver borrowings. in addition, we had $3.1 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-u.s. businesses. we had $75.9 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31, 2017, of which $33.1 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.
we may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to u.s. treasury securities.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.
cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2017 totaled $592 million. the tax act included a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax on all undistributed foreign earnings, resulting in a charge of $110.7 million as of december 31, 2017. the company will elect to pay the liability over 8 years. in addition, the introduction of a modified territorial taxation system resulted in a one-time estimated charge of $28.7 million due to the company's change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion on foreign earnings. the company now intends to distribute all historical earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax and has provided for deferred taxes related to the future state and foreign tax cost to repatriate. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes.
capital expenditures of $48.8 million, $37.3 million and $36.3 million were incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. capitalized software expenditures of $10.8 million, $2.8 million and $2.4 million were incurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increases in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to our 2016 acquisitions. in the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.

1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and other income tax liabilities resulting from the tax act considered "provisional." see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $573.4 million of outstanding surety bonds. certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations.
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.
we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. however, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2018 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. none of these factors can be predicted with certainty.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
recently issued accounting standards see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of newmont mining corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, "newmont," the "company," "our" and "we"). we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our md&a. for a detailed description of each of the non-gaap measures used in this md&a, please see the discussion under non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 74. references to "a$" refer to australian currency and "c$" refer to canadian currency. this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report.
overview        newmont is one of the world's largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the s&p 500 index and fortune 500. we have been included in the dow jones sustainability index-world for 11 consecutive years and have adopted the world gold council's conflict-free gold policy. we are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and copper properties. we have significant operations and/or assets in the united states ("u.s."), australia, peru, ghana and suriname.
on november 2, 2016, newmont completed the sale of its 48.5% economic interest in pt newmont nusa tenggara ("ptnnt"), which operated the batu hijau copper and gold mine ("batu hijau") in indonesia (the "batu hijau transaction"). as a result, newmont presents batu hijau as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. in the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion in our results of consolidated operations below.
we continue to focus on delivering superior operational execution to generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders.        consolidated financial results        the details of our net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to newmont stockholders are set forth below:

results in 2017 compared to 2016 were impacted by a $970 prior-year impairment charge ($512 attributable to newmont), a full year of production at merian and long canyon, an increase in gold production from the cc&v expansion completed in the first quarter of 2016, and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher taxes from the tax cuts and jobs act ("the act") enacted in december 2017, a prior-year gain from the sale of the company's investment in regis resources ltd ("regis") and adverse weather conditions impacting production at tanami and yanacocha during the first quarter of 2017.
results in 2016 compared to 2015 were impacted by a $970 impairment charge ($512 attributable to newmont) in december 2016 related to assets in south america that were evaluated in connection with management's review of the yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans, an increase in the company's valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, gains in 2015 resulting from the deconsolidation of tmac resources, inc. ("tmac") and the sale of the company's investment in european gold refinery

holdings ("egr") in 2015, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes and realized prices and the positive impact of a gain from sale of the company's investment in regis during 2016.

gold sales increased 9% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes from a full year of production and sales at merian and long canyon and the cc&v expansion completed in the first quarter of 2016 as well as higher average realized prices, partially offset by adverse weather conditions impacting production at tanami and yanacocha during the first quarter of 2017. gold sales increased 11% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of merian and long canyon in october 2016 and november 2016, respectively, the acquisition of cc&v in august 2015, higher average realized prices and higher sales volumes at existing operations, partially offset by the sale of waihi in october 2015. for a complete discussion regarding variations in gold volumes, see results of consolidated operations below.

costs applicable to sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a full year of commercial production at merian and long canyon, the cc&v expansion completed in the first quarter of 2016, and higher direct operating costs, partially offset by lower leach pad inventory adjustments. costs applicable to sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of cc&v in 2015, the addition of merian and long canyon in october 2016 and november 2016, respectively, and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments at ahafo and yanacocha, partially offset by the sale of waihi in october 2015 and lower oil prices.

depreciation and amortization increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a full year of production at merian and long canyon, partially offset by a lower asset balance resulting from an impairment recorded at yanacocha in december 2016. depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of cc&v in august 2015, the addition of merian and long canyon in october 2016 and november 2016, respectively, and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments at ahafo and yanacocha, partially offset by the sale of waihi in october 2015.
for a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see results of consolidated operations.
reclamation and remediation expense was $177, $179, and $253 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. reclamation and remediation expense in 2017 was in line with 2016 as increased reclamation costs related to yanacocha during 2016 were largely offset by increased costs at the rain, midnite, resurrection and san luis remediation and closure sites during 2017. reclamation and remediation expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in remediation costs arising from revisions made to the remediation plan for the midnite mine in washington state during 2015, partially offset with the increase in reclamation costs related to yanacocha during 2016 as outlined in note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.
exploration expense was $179, $148, and $156 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. exploration expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher expenditures for near-mine exploration at tanami, cc&v, kalgoorlie and yanacocha, in addition to greenfield exploration in the guiana shield and other locations as we continue to focus on developing future reserves. exploration expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the deconsolidation of tmac in 2015 and lower expenditures at yanacocha, partially offset by increased expenditures at various projects.
for additional information about proven and probable reserves, including additions and reductions, see the discussion in gold, copper and silver reserves in item 1, business, and proven and probable reserves in item 2, properties.
advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. advanced projects, research and development expense was $143, $134, and $126 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with full potential opportunities in north america and advanced studies on the yanacocha sulfides project, partially offset by prior-year merian pre-production expenses. advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased costs to develop various studies and merian pre-production expenses, partially offset by reduced spend on conga care and maintenance.
56
general and administrative expense was $237, $233, and $241 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. general and administrative expense in 2017 was in line with 2016. general and administrative expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to lower regional administrative costs, lower contracted services and lower non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher legal costs. general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined in 2017 to 3.2%, compared to 3.5% and 4.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
impairment of long-lived assets totaled $14, $977 and $56 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the 2017 impairments related to equipment and long lived assets in south america, australia and corporate. the 2016 impairments were primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets at yanacocha in south america as a result of the updated long-term mining and closure plans. for additional information regarding our review of the yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. the 2015 impairments were primarily related to assets in south america, non-essential equipment unrelated to operations at corporate and other and an intangible asset in africa.
other expense, net was $32, $58, and $116 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. other expense, net decreased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower severance and outsourcing costs, primarily at corporate, and lower adjustments to the contingent consideration and related liabilities associated with the acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in boddington in june 2009. other expense, net decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a charge of $27 from the ratification of the ghana investment agreement in december 2015, acquisition costs related to cc&v during 2015 and lower power plant costs in western australia.
other income, net was $54, $69, and $135 for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. other income, net decreased in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a prior-year gain of $103 from the sale of the company's investment in regis in march 2016 and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a prior-year loss of $55 associated with debt repayments in march 2016 and november 2016. other income, net decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to gains of $108 associated with the sale of certain assets, including hemlo in march 2015 and egr in july 2015, a gain of $76 from the deconsolidation of tmac in july 2015, a loss of $55 associated with debt repayments in march 2016 and november 2016 and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these decreases were partially offset by lower other-than-temporary impairments on marketable security investments and a gain of $103 from the sale of the company's investment in regis in march 2016.
interest expense, net was $241, $273 and $297 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. capitalized interest totaled $22, $33 and $40 in each year, respectively. interest expense, net decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reduced debt balances as a result of the repayment of the 2017 convertible senior notes in 2017 and partial early extinguishment of the 2019, 2022 and 2039 senior notes in 2016. capitalized interest decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the completion of the long canyon and merian projects in 2016, partially offset by additional interest capitalized for the subika underground project and ahafo mill expansion. interest expense, net decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to reduced debt balances as a result of the partial early extinguishment of the 2019, 2022 and 2039 senior notes and repayment of the 2019 term loan in 2016. capitalized interest decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the completion of the turf vent shaft project in 2015, partially offset by additional interest capitalized for the long canyon and merian projects.
57
income and mining tax expense was $1,125, $563 and $391 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors as illustrated in the table below. the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of enactment of tax reform; (iv) the non-recognition of tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) and the impact of specific transactions and assessments. as a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. this trend is expected to continue in future periods.

(1)   includes the release of a valuation allowance on amt credits of $48 and elimination of $8 of deferred tax assets due to changes to executive compensation deductions.

(2)   see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act.

the change in the effective tax rate was impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act ("the act") which was enacted on december 22, 2017. the act significantly changes u.s. income tax law and is the first major overhaul of the federal income tax code in more than 30 years. key provisions of the act that impact newmont include: (i) reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax ("amt") system (iii) replacement of the worldwide taxation system with a territorial tax system which exempts certain foreign operations from u.s. taxation, and (iv) further limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. other provisions of the act that do not have a current impact on newmont but could impact the company in the future include: (i) modification of earnings calculations for certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred to a one-time tax, (ii) creation of a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings and a new base erosion anti-abuse tax, (iii) repeal of the domestic production deductions, (iv) allowance for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property, (v) limitation on the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a u.s. corporation, and (vi) modification and/or repeal of a number of other international provisions.
on december 22, 2017, staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") was issued to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act. in accordance with sab 118, the company has calculated the best estimate of the impact of the act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with the company's understanding of the act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. the provisional amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $346. the provisional amount related to restructuring decisions implemented as a result of the act was $395. the company also recorded a $48 benefit related to the release of valuation allowance on amt credits and $8 charge for the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with deferred compensation plans.
in january 2018, the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provisions of the act. the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. the guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to gilti inclusions or treating any taxes on gilti inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. effective the first quarter of 2018, the company will elect to treat any potential gilti inclusions as a period cost as it is not projecting any material impact from gilti inclusions and any deferred taxes related to any inclusion would be immaterial.

equity income (loss) of affiliates was $(16), $(13), and $(45) in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the increased loss in 2017 from 2016 is mainly due to a $5 increase in losses recognized at la zanja as a result of an impairment of its long-lived assets. the equity loss from affiliates decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to $30 of losses recognized in 2015 at la zanja from increased exploration spending on the pampa verde project.

the holt royalty obligation increased in 2017 primarily due to an increase in short-term gold price and an increase in production based on gold reserves and resources from kirkland lake gold ltd., which were updated in march 2017, which resulted in an increase in the net loss from discontinued operations in 2017. the holt royalty obligation increased in 2016 primarily due to increases in short-term gold price and decreases in discount rates, which resulted in an increase in the net loss from discontinued operations in 2016. the holt royalty obligation decreased in 2015 primarily due to decreases in short-term gold prices and increases in discount rates, which resulted in an increase in net income from discontinued operations in 2015.
the batu hijau contingent consideration resulting from the batu hijau transaction increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in short-term copper price in 2017.
the batu hijau transaction was completed in november 2016. the income from batu hijau increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher gold sale volumes, higher average realized gold prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower copper sale volumes and lower realized copper prices.
newmont recognized a loss on the sale of batu hijau of $600 in 2016.
for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion regarding batu hijau's operating results, see the discontinued operations section in results of consolidated operations below.
net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax from continuing operations was $(11), $570, and $140 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the income from noncontrolling interests increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to decreased losses at yanacocha, primarily related to the 2016 impairment of long-lived assets, and increased earnings at merian due to a full year of production in 2017. the loss from noncontrolling interests increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the impairment of long-lived assets at yanacocha in 2016.
other comprehensive income (loss) was $42, $-, and $144 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the increase in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to the change in fair value of marketable securities and pension and other post-retirement benefits, partially

2017 compared to 2016
consolidated gold ounces produced increased 8% due to:
·   higher production from north america due to a full year's production at long canyon, higher ore placement and recoveries at valley leach fill 2 at cc&amp;v and higher ore grade milled at carlin and phoenix, partially offset by lower ore grades and throughput at twin creeks and geotechnical issues at the silverstar mine at carlin;

·   higher production from south america primarily due to a full year's production at merian partially offset by lower mill grade and lower leach tons placed at yanacocha;

·   lower production from australia due to lower ore grade milled at boddington, tanami and kalgoorlie partially offset by higher mill throughput at boddington and tanami. the higher throughput at tanami was partially offset by the mill being placed into care and maintenance for 21 days in early 2017 following record high rainfall that blocked transport routes, limiting access to fuel and other resources; and

·   consistent production from africa at both ahafo and akyem.

consolidated copper production decreased 5% primarily due to lower heap leach placement and lower mill grade and throughput at phoenix and partially offset by higher production at boddington from higher mill grade and throughput at boddington.
costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce increased 1% due to higher direct operating costs, partially offset by higher gold ounces sold and lower leach pad inventory adjustments. costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound decreased 25% primarily due to a lower co-product allocation of costs to copper.
depreciation and amortization per gold ounce decreased 4% due to higher ounces sold, a lower asset balance at yanacocha resulting from an impairment recorded in december 2016, and lower leach pad inventory adjustments. depreciation and amortization per consolidated copper pound decreased 25% due to a lower co-product allocation of depreciation and amortization to copper.
all-in sustaining costs per consolidated gold ounce increased 1% primarily due to higher costs applicable to sales per ounce. all-in sustaining costs per copper pound decreased 22% primarily due to lower costs applicable to sales per pound.

2016 compared to 2015
consolidated gold ounces produced increased 4% due to:
·   higher production from north america due to a full year of operation at cc&amp;v, long canyon achieving commercial production in november 2016, and higher ore tons, grade and leach recoveries at carlin, partially offset by a planned stripping campaign at twin creeks;

·   lower production from south america primarily due to lower mill throughput, recovery and grade at yanacocha, partially offset by merian achieving commercial production in october 2016.

·   lower production at our australia operations due to the sale of waihi in october 2015, partially offset by higher throughput and higher ore grade milled at kalgoorlie, higher ore tons mined and milled an tanami, and higher throughput and mill recovery rates at boddington; and

·   higher production from africa due to higher throughput as a result of higher mill utilization and slightly higher mill recovery rates, partially offset by lower grades milled and a build-up of mill in-circuit inventory;

consolidated copper production decreased 5% primarily due to lower heap leach recoveries and lower ore grade milled at phoenix and lower ore grade milled at boddington, partially offset by higher throughput and recovery at boddington.
costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce and copper pound increased 3% and 8%, respectively, due to higher leach pad and stockpile inventory adjustments at yanacocha and ahafo and lower ore grade mined and milled, partially offset by higher ounces sold as a result of more ore tons mined and higher mill throughput.
depreciation and amortization increased 8% and 22% per gold ounce and copper pound, respectively, due to higher stockpile inventory adjustments, higher amortization rates, capitalization of additional assets, and lower copper pounds sold.
all-in sustaining costs per consolidated gold ounce decreased 2% primarily due to higher ounces sold and lower sustaining capital spend. all-in sustaining costs per consolidated copper pound sold increased 7% primarily due to lower copper pounds sold.

foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in u.s. dollars. despite selling gold in london, we have no exposure to the euro or the british pound.        our foreign operations sell their gold and copper production based on u.s. dollar metal prices. approximately 32%, 33% and 37% of our costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the u.s. dollar in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which approximately 27% was denominated in the australian dollar in the current year. variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased costs applicable to sales by $1 per ounce, net of hedging losses, in 2017 compared to 2016, of which australia accounted for approximately $3 per ounce of the total increase, which was partially offset by suriname of approximately $2 per ounce. variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased costs applicable to sales by $2 per ounce, net of hedging losses, in 2016 compared to 2015, of which australia accounted for approximately $1 of the total decrease.
we hedge a portion of our forecasted australian dollar denominated operating expenditures to reduce variability of our australia dollar exposure. due to the limited nature of the company's current australian hedge program, which extends through february 2018, increases to the australian dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate could result in increased costs. the company may extend its australian dollar hedge program in the future.

liquidity and capital resources        we have a disciplined cash management strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and provide long-term value to our shareholders. consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends.
at december 31, 2017, we had $3,259 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $783 was held in foreign subsidiaries the majority of which is held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to u.s. dollars. at december 31, 2017, $318 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our peru and suriname operations, which is being held to fund operating costs and capital expenditures at those operations. at december 31, 2017, $697 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($386 attributable to newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. we expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes. we believe that our liquidity and capital resources from u.s. operations and flow-through foreign subsidiaries are adequate to fund our u.s. operations and corporate activities.
we believe our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations, pay dividends and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. at december 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

off-balance sheet arrangements we have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as discussed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements) and $2,321 of outstanding surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees (see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements). at december 31, 2017, $80 of the $3,000 corporate revolving credit facility was used to secure the issuance of letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations.
we also have sales agreements or non-binding commitments to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons):

environmental        our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. we have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, $1,965 and $1,792, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which $59 and $28, respectively, were classified as current liabilities.
73
in addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $289 and $298 were accrued for such obligations at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we spent $44, $30 and $41 during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former, primarily historic, mining activities and have classified $41 and $33 as a current liability at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. expenditures during 2017 relate primarily to project spending at the midnite mine site and dawn mill site in washington state. expenditures during 2016 relate primarily to project spending at the midnite mine site and dawn mill site and the con mine in canada. expenditures during 2015 relate primarily to the settlement payment with the state of california related to the empire star mine remediation and past costs, and project spending at the midnite mine site and dawn mill site and the con mine.
during the year ended 2017, 2016, and 2015, capital expenditures were approximately $78, $79, and $137, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations.

forward-looking statements        the foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report, contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. see the discussion in forward-looking statements in item 1, business.
non-gaap financial measures        non-gaap financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. unless otherwise noted, we present the non-gaap financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization management uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and ebitda adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period ("adjusted ebitda") as non-gaap measures to evaluate the company's operating performance. ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by gaap, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. although adjusted ebitda and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. the company believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. management's determination of the components of adjusted ebitda are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-gaap financial measures used by mining industry analysts. net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders is reconciled to ebitda and adjusted ebitda as follows:

free cash flow management uses free cash flow as a non-gaap measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the company believes free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the company's performance with its competitors. although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the company's calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.
the presentation of non-gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company's performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by gaap, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. the company's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations
78
or payments made for business acquisitions. therefore, the company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the company's consolidated statements of cash flows.
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the company believes to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-gaap financial measures. these measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. these measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently.
the following tables reconcile these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

all-in sustaining costs        newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on gaap measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-gaap measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.
current gaap-measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-gaap measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor's visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.
all-in sustaining cost ("aisc") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting

principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to aisc. differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company's internal policies.
the following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:
costs applicable to sales. includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from costs applicable to sales ("cas"), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. cas includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. cas is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes depreciation and amortization and reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of cas on the consolidated statements of operations. in determining aisc, only the cas associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. therefore, the amount of gold cas included in aisc is derived from the cas presented in the company's consolidated statements of operations less the amount of cas attributable to the production of copper at our phoenix and boddington mines. the copper cas at those mine sites is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period.
reclamation costs. includes accretion expense related to asset retirement obligation ("aro") and the amortization of the related asset retirement cost ("arc") for the company's operating properties. accretion related to the aro and the amortization of the arc assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with gaap. the accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
advanced projects, research and development and exploration. includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current production and exploration. we note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. as this relates to sustaining our production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the aisc measure. these costs are derived from the advanced projects, research and development and exploration amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our phoenix and boddington mines. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
general and administrative. includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. including these expenses in the aisc metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.
other expense, net. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. furthermore, this adjustment to other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders as disclosed in the company's non-gaap financial measure adjusted net income (loss). the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.
treatment and refining costs. includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. these costs are presented net as a reduction of sales on our consolidated statements of operations.
sustaining capital. we determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are generally considered development. we determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. sustaining capital costs are relevant to the aisc metric as these are needed to maintain the company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. the allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and copper at the phoenix and boddington mines.

accounting developments        for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies        listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the
83
circumstances. actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. we have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.
depreciation and amortization expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. these lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.
costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. at our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. at our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. all such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ("uop") method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.
major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the uop method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. to the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.
capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the uop method based on recoverable ounces by source. other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets.
the calculation of the uop rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. these changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. if reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.
the expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations.
carrying value of stockpiles stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. we generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of gold ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile's average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed.
84
we record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. we recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of stockpiles to net realizable value of $134, $144 and $70 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as components of cost applicable to sales and depreciation and amortization. the significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2017 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of stockpiles of up to approximately $150.
other less significant assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and a u.s. to australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on stockpiles. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.

carrying value of ore on leach pads ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold or copper. costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper on the leach pad.
estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). in general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.
although the quantities of recoverable ore placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. as a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. we recorded write-downs to reduce the carrying value of leach pads to net realizable value of $141, $270 and $272 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as components of cost applicable to sales and depreciation and amortization. the significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2017 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in a write-down to the carrying value of leach pads of up to approximately $50.
86
other less significant assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value.

carrying value of long-lived assets we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are considered level 3 fair value measurements.
87
occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.
the estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates.
the significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at december 31, 2017 is a long-term gold price of $1,300 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long lived assets of up to approximately $1,500 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge.
other less significant assumptions include proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, value beyond proven and probable estimates, the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves, commodity-based and other input costs, future closure costs and discount rates unique to each operation, as well as a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and u.s. to australian dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80.
during 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairments of $14, $977, and $56, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in impairment of long-lived assets. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairments.
as discussed above under depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. the ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.
events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows.
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is probable and recognition of a completed sale is expected to occur within one year, the sales price is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn, in accordance with accounting standard codification ("asc") 360, property, plant and equipment. a business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. if the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell, a loss is recognized. assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the current and prior balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.
we report the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results when the business is classified as held for sale, in accordance with asc 360, property, plant and equipment and asc 205-20, presentation of financial statements - discontinued operations. the results of discontinued operations are reported in net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for current and prior periods, including any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.
88
derivative instruments all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. the derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures and diesel purchases where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. to the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations immediately.
reclamation and remediation obligations reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. we review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.
remediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. changes in remediation estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable. all other costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required.
income and mining taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. we derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. the financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate.
on december 22, 2017, staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") was issued to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act. we determine if the assessment of a particular income tax effect is "complete" or "incomplete" as of the due date of the financial statements. those effects for which the accounting is determined to be complete are reported in the enactment period financial statements.
for those effects determined to be incomplete, we determine whether a reasonable estimate of those effects can be made. if a reasonable estimate can be made, the estimate is recognized as a provisional amount. if a reasonable estimate cannot be made, no effects are recognized as provisional amounts until the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be made. provisional amounts are updated when additional information becomes available and the evaluation of such information is complete. we complete the accounting for all provisional amounts within a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date.
89
mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. with respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of our consolidated companies.
our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income and mining tax benefit (expense). in certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible.
valuation of deferred tax assets our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.
certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. we look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses.
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. however, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. we also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis.
other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:
·   earnings history;

·   projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;

·   the duration of statutory carry forward periods;

·   prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference;

·   nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and

·   the sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.

our recent earnings history and forecasted future results, driven by its existing reserves and the forecasted long-term commodity prices, points to the full realization of those deferred tax assets in the u.s. and australia not previously subject to a valuation allowance. we are in a cumulative three year loss in peru and based on the declining production profile at yanacocha, it is more likely
90
than not that the net deferred tax assets in peru will not be realized in the future. accordingly, an additional valuation allowance of $40 on these assets was recognized at december 31, 2017.
due to changes the tax cuts and jobs act made to certain international tax provisions, it was prudent for the company to restructure the holding of its non-u.s. operations for u.s. federal income tax purposes. this was accomplished by executing and filing various "check the box" elections made with respect to certain non-us subsidiaries of the company. the elections resulted in the conversions of these subsidiaries from branches and/or foreign partnerships to regarded foreign corporations. one result of these conversions is the company no longer carries a u.s. deferred tax asset related to the investment in yanacocha and released the valuation allowance of $292 which was originally recorded on december 31, 2016.
the company determined that the realization of deferred tax assets related to certain carry forwards such as tax losses and tax pools in canada, capital losses in the u.s. and australia, and foreign tax credits in the u.s., does not meet the more likely than not standard. accordingly, these assets continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. at december 31, 2017, the valuation allowance related to these assets was $1,296. realization is dependent not only on generating sufficient taxable income in the period that net deferred tax assets reverse but also on the character/classification of that income. the alternative minimum tax was removed by the tax cuts and jobs act, and the company's alternative minimum tax credit carryforward will be refunded over a 5 year period. therefore, the company removed the full valuation allowance on alternative minimum tax credits for december 31, 2017. the re-measurement of the company's deferred tax assets due to the tax cuts and jobs act also impacted related valuation allowances; see schedule ii-valuation and qualifying accounts.
for additional risk factors that could impact the company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

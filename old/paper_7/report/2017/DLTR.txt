overview we are a leading operator of more than 14,800 discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. second is the performance of stores once they are open. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; however, they are not included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017. stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner.
at february 3, 2018, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017 is as follows:

stores are included as rebanners when they close or open, respectively. comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store.
the average size of stores opened in 2017 was approximately 8,180 selling square feet (or about 10,180 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 7,160 selling square feet (or about 8,860 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. for 2018, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet (or about 7,000 - 9,000 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. we believe that these size stores are our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits, which increases our customer traffic.
fiscal 2017 ended on february 3, 2018 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. the 53rd week in 2017 added approximately $406.6 million in sales. fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 which ended on january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016, respectively, each included 52 weeks.
in fiscal 2017, comparable store net sales increased by 1.9% on a constant currency basis. this increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both years. constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year's comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year's currency exchange rates. we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance. including the impact of currency, comparable store net sales increased the same 1.9% as a result of a 0.9% increase in the number of transactions and a 1.0% increase in average ticket. on a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 3.4% in the dollar tree segment and increased 0.4% in the family dollar segment in fiscal 2017. comparable store net sales in the dollar tree segment increased 3.5% when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2017, and we continued the roll-out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores. at february 3, 2018, the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 5,205 stores, which includes re-bannered stores, compared to approximately 4,785 stores at january 28, 2017. we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.
we believe our initiatives at family dollar are positively affecting the comparable store net sales performance. among these is a store renovation initiative. during fiscal 2017, we completed approximately 375 family dollar renovations. these renovations have focused on creating an exciting and more productive family dollar shopping experience. renovations bring some of the oldest stores to our brand standard, including more productive end-caps, highlighting more relevant and prominent seasonal offerings, assortment expansions in beverage and snacks, hair care, and food in coolers and freezers. category adjacencies and updating our front-end checkout are also part of the renovation program. we are making a number of improvements to the conditions of our stores to provide our customers with a consistent and improved shopping experience. in addition, we have focused on re-branding our private brand labels in our stores. these private brands are being developed to provide national brand comparable quality and great values for our customers, as part of our compare and save marketing program. we are adding additional coolers and freezers to facilitate expansion of our product offerings.
our point-of-sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations.
we must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results.
acquisition and divestiture on july 6, 2015 we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary. under the acquisition, the family dollar shareholders received $59.60 in cash and 0.2484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the "merger consideration").
as of the acquisition date, each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration (the "psr payment"). the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was $6.8 billion in cash and we issued 28.5 million shares of our common stock, valued at $2.3 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2, 2015.
28
for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on july 8, 2015.
we incurred $39.2 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2015, excluding acquisition-related interest expense. we also expended approximately $165.7 million in capitalizable debt-issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and $61.5 million and $78.8 million of debt-issuance costs was included as a reduction in "long-term debt, net, excluding current portion" at february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017, respectively.
we expect to achieve approximately $300 million in annual cost savings synergies by july 2018, and we will incur $300 million in one-time costs to achieve these synergies.
in 2015, we completed the offering of $3.25 billion of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities. see "liquidity and capital resources" for a further discussion of these transactions.
in connection with the acquisition, we divested 330 family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets. the 330 family dollar stores, 325 of which were open at the time of the divestiture, represented approximately $45.5 million of annual operating income. in accordance with purchase accounting, the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the estimates of fair value set forth in "note 2 - acquisition".
in the first and second quarters of 2017, we evaluated the collectability of certain receivables from dollar express relating to the divestiture. based on information then available, we determined that outstanding amounts totaling $53.5 million were not recoverable and recorded impairment charges to write down the receivables to zero. in the fourth quarter of 2017, a settlement was reached, under which sycamore partners and dollar express paid us $35.0 million which resulted in a partial reversal of the receivables impairment in our fiscal fourth quarter 2017.

fiscal year ended february 3, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended january 28, 2017
net sales. net sales increased 7.4%, or $1,526.3 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from sales in new dollar tree and family dollar stores, increased comparable store net sales and the 53rd week in 2017, which accounted for $406.6 million of the increase. comparable store net sales increased 1.9% on a constant currency basis as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count. this increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods. comparable store net sales also increased 1.9% when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 3.4% in the dollar tree segment and increased 0.4% in the family dollar segment. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $627.2 million or 9.8%, to $7,021.9 million in 2017 compared to $6,394.7 million in 2016. gross profit margin increased to 31.6% in 2017 from 30.8% in 2016. our gross profit margin improvement was primarily the result of lower merchandise costs as a percentage of sales resulting from improved mark-on in fiscal 2017, fewer markdowns in the current year and leverage from the sales in the 53rd week.
29
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $5,022.8 million in 2017 from $4,689.9 million in 2016, an increase of $332.9 million or 7.1%. as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.6% in 2017 and 2016. fiscal 2017, includes an $18.5 million receivable impairment related to the divestiture and a $12.6 million increase to the dollar tree workers' compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis. excluding the receivable impairment and the workers' compensation reserve increase, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22.4%, as a percentage of sales, due to the leverage from the 53rd week and the net of the following:
•   lower depreciation costs;
•   lower store operating costs as a percentage of sales;
•   higher advertising costs; and,
•   higher payroll costs.
operating income. operating income for 2017 increased to $1,999.1 million compared with $1,704.8 million in 2016 and operating income margin increased to 9.0% in 2017 from 8.2% in 2016.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, we benefited with respect to the tcja. we expect to continue to benefit going forward and estimate the benefit to be approximately $250.0 million in fiscal 2018. we plan to reinvest approximately $100.0 million of this tax savings into the following:
•   increased store hours, including training for associates;
•   higher average hourly rates;
•   adding family dollar eligible associates to the dollar tree retirement savings plan starting in fiscal 2017 and increasing contributions in fiscal 2018; and,
•   instituting paid maternity leave for eligible associates.
this reinvestment could reduce operating income margin in 2018.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $301.8 million in 2017 compared to $375.5 million in 2016. the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding in the current year as a result of $990.1 million in prepayments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the $500.0 million prepayment in the second quarter of 2017. fiscal 2016 also includes the expensing of $26.6 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million in fees associated with the refinancing of the new senior secured credit facilities. on january 30, 2018, we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the $750.0 million 2020 notes on march 1, 2018. in connection with the early redemption of the 2020 notes, we recorded a make-whole premium of $9.8 million which was payable on the call date of march 1, 2018.
income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 0.6% compared to expense of 32.6% in 2016. the decrease is due to the tcja that was signed into law on december 22, 2017, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and made numerous other law changes, effective as of january 1, 2018. our fiscal 2017 includes 34 days in calendar year 2018, therefore our overall 2017 statutory federal corporate tax rate is 33.7%. the effective tax rate also includes a $562.0 million benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21%. the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate which resulted in a decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and a $9.9 million decrease in tax expense. the 2017 rate also includes a reduction of approximately $5.6 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes. the tax rate in fiscal 2016 includes benefits resulting from a one-time election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes and a 1.0% decrease in north carolina's state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset.
on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act ("sab 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tcja, in effect allowing an entity to use a methodology similar to the measurement period in a business combination. pursuant to the disclosure provisions of sab 118, as of february 3, 2018, we have not completed our analysis of all of the effects of the tcja. additionally, future guidance from the internal revenue service ("irs"), sec, or the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") could result in changes to our accounting for the tax effects of the tcja. while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the statutory federal corporate tax rate, the rate may be affected by other analyses related to the tcja including, but not limited to, federal temporary differences resulting from accounting method changes or other adjustments. for further discussion of the
30
impact of the tcja, refer to "note 4 - income taxes" under the caption "income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k.
we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 23% in fiscal 2018, subject to adjustments related to the sab 118 items noted above.

net sales. net sales increased 33.7%, or $5,220.8 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting from $4,418.5 million of incremental net sales from family dollar due to 22 additional weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, sales in the dollar tree segment's new stores and increased comparable store net sales partially offset by the loss of sales in the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015 in satisfaction of a federal trade commission requirement in connection with the family dollar acquisition. comparable store net sales increased 1.8% on a constant currency basis. including the impact of currency, comparable store net sales also increased 1.8% due to an increase in average ticket as well as customer count. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $1,738.0 million or 37.3%, to $6,394.7 million in 2016 compared to $4,656.7 million in 2015. the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by $1,402.6 million of incremental gross profit for family dollar, due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as higher sales for dollar tree partially offset by the loss of gross profit from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015. gross profit margin increased to 30.8% in 2016 from 30.1% in 2015 as a result of the prior year including $73.0 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and $70.2 million in amortization expense for family dollar related to the stepped-up inventory which was sold during the 52 weeks ended january 30, 2016. in addition, the current year gross profit margin reflects lower merchandise cost due to higher initial mark-on and favorable freight costs. our gross profit margin in the current year included an additional 22 weeks of family dollar's operations which have a lower-margin product mix. this negatively impacted the current year's results in relation to the prior year's results.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $4,689.9 million from $3,607.0 million in 2015, an increase of $1,082.9 million or 30.0%. the increase was primarily due to an incremental $972.3 million of expense for family dollar due to the 22 additional weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the divestiture of 325 stores on november 1, 2015. as a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22.6% in 2016 from 23.3% in 2015. in 2015, we incurred $39.1 million or 25 basis points of acquisition expenses. excluding acquisition expenses, the selling, general and administrative rate for 2016 as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points to 22.6% from 23.0% as a result of lower payroll-related costs and depreciation as a percentage of net sales and lower professional fees and legal fees partially offset by higher store repairs and maintenance as a percentage of net sales.
operating income. operating income for 2016 increased to $1,704.8 million compared with $1,049.7 million in 2015. operating income margin increased to 8.2% in 2016 from 6.8% in 2015. the increase in operating income is the result of an incremental $430.3 million of operating income in the family dollar segment, due to the additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 and a $224.8 million increase in operating income in the dollar tree segment partially offset by the loss of operating income from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015. in the prior year, the family dollar segment incurred an operating loss of $30.8 million as a result of unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of stepped-up inventory that was sold during the period.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $375.5 million in 2016 compared to $599.4 million in 2015. the variance is due to the following:
•   an $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the senior notes in 2015;
•   a $39.5 million prepayment fee, a $17.4 million write-off of the original issuance discount and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs related to the term loan b refinancing in 2015;
•   a $1.0 billion prepayment of term loan b-1 principal in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in the accelerated expensing of $19.0 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs in 2015 and lower interest expense in 2016;
•   an additional $242.0 million prepayment of term loan b-1 in the third quarter of 2016 which resulted in lower interest expense in 2016;
31
•   the term loans were refinanced in the third quarter of 2016 which resulted in lower interest rates and the accelerated expensing of $26.6 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million in fees; and,
•   a $748.1 million prepayment of the remaining principal for term loan b-3 in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the accelerated expensing of $11.7 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs.
income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2016 was 32.6% compared to 37.0% in 2015. the decrease in the tax rate is primarily the result of a one-time election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes, a 1.0% decrease in north carolina's state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and the adoption of asu no. 2016-09 under which the incremental tax benefit recognized upon rsu vestings and stock option exercises is recorded in income tax expense.
segment information we operate a chain of more than 14,800 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
the dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. the dollar tree segment includes our operations under the "dollar tree" and "dollar tree canada" brands, 11 distribution centers in the united states, two distribution centers in canada and a store support center in chesapeake, virginia.
the family dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. the family dollar segment consists of our operations under the "family dollar" brand, 11 distribution centers and a store support center in matthews, north carolina.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income (loss), including the allocation of distribution center and store support center costs, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. if the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances would be reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.

•   higher payroll costs, resulting primarily from higher store hourly wages and higher incentive compensation expense; and,
•   lower depreciation costs and utility costs as a percentage of sales resulting from the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and sales in the 53rd week.

in 2016, net cash provided by financing activities decreased $7,109.3 million compared to 2015 primarily due to lower debt proceeds partially offset by lower principal payments compared to the prior year.
at february 3, 2018, our long-term borrowings were $5,732.7 million. we also have $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements, under which approximately $168.0 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february 3, 2018.
in september 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement ("npa") with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $750.0 million of senior notes (the "notes") in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the notes consisted of three tranches: $300.0 million of 4.03% senior notes due september 16, 2020; $350.0 million of 4.63% senior notes due september 16, 2023; and $100.0 million of 4.78% senior notes due september 16, 2025. interest on the notes was payable semi-annually on january 15 and july 15 of each year. the notes were unsecured and ranked pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. we could prepay some or all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount. in the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement), we could have been required to prepay the notes. the note purchase agreement contained customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance share repurchases.
on january 20, 2015, we entered into the first amendment (the " notes amendment") to the note purchase agreement, with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. the notes amendment was entered into in connection with our pending acquisition of family dollar. the notes amendment allowed, among other things, a newly-formed subsidiary of dollar tree to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition (such debt, the "escrow debt"). pursuant to the terms of the notes amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the notes could increase by 1.0% per annum. the notes amendment also contained certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any escrow debt is outstanding. on the acquisition date, we prepaid the notes outstanding of $750.0 million and paid $89.5 million of a make-whole premium, determined in accordance with the provisions of the dollar tree npa plus additional interest in accordance with the provisions of the first amendment to the dollar tree npa.
in june 2012, we entered into a five-year $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement (the agreement). the agreement provided for a $750.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit. the interest rate on the agreement was based, at our option, on a libor rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. the agreement also bore a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. the agreement also bore an administrative fee payable annually. the agreement, among other things, required the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricted the payment of certain distributions and prohibited the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.
in september 2013, we amended the agreement to enable the issuance of the notes.
on august 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment (the "credit amendment") to the agreement. the credit amendment further amended the agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing to finance the acquisition. the credit amendment also facilitated escrow arrangements related to the acquisition. on the acquisition date, we paid in full all amounts owing under the agreement and terminated all commitments to extend further credit thereunder.
on february 23, 2015, we completed the offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. we used the proceeds of the acquisition notes to finance in part the acquisition. on august 1, 2016, we completed the exchange of the acquisition notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms. the acquisition notes are fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries which guarantee the obligations under our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries.
the 2020 notes, which mature on march 1, 2020, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2020 notes indenture"). the 2023 notes, which mature on march 1, 2023, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2023 notes indenture", and together with the 2020 notes indenture, the "indentures").
35
interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year and commenced on september 1, 2015. no principal is due on the acquisition notes until their maturity dates.
the indentures contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; (iii) make any principal payment on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt; (iv) make loans, advances or other investments; (v) incur liens; (vi) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (vii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all assets to, another person; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. the indentures also provide for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding acquisition notes under the applicable indenture to be declared immediately due and payable.
the restriction in the indentures on our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain significant exceptions, including an exception that permits us to pay dividends and make other distributions regardless of dollar amount so long as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, we would have a consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined under the indentures, no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. as of february 3, 2018, our consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined in the indentures, was below 3.50 to 1.00. so long as our consolidated total net leverage ratio remains below 3.50 to 1.00, the indentures do not restrict our ability to pay dividends.
on january 30, 2018, we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the $750.0 million 2020 notes on march 1, 2018. in connection with the early redemption of our 2020 notes, we recorded a make-whole premium of $9.8 million which was payable on the call date of march 1, 2018. we paid the $759.8 million on march 1, 2018. the remaining $6.1 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs at february 3, 2018 were fully expensed at the call date of march 1, 2018.
on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consisted of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date.
upon the consummation of the acquisition, we drew the term loans under the term loan a facility and have the ability to borrow under the new revolving credit facility.
the new senior secured credit facilities were not guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the acquisition, but upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of dollar tree and the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
the new senior secured credit facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. these include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repay the acquisition notes, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. in addition, a financial maintenance covenant based on our consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio will apply to the new revolving credit facility and the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities.
the restriction in the new senior secured credit facilities on our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain significant exceptions, including an exception that permits us to pay dividends and make other restricted payments regardless of dollar amount so long as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, we would have a consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined under the new senior secured credit facilities, no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. as of february 3, 2018, our consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined in the new senior secured credit facilities, was below 3.50 to 1.00. so long as our consolidated total net leverage ratio remains below 3.50 to 1.00, the new senior secured credit facilities do not restrict our ability to pay dividends.
on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term loan b-1 and $650.0 million of 4.25% fixed-rate term loan b-2. the term loan b-2 does not require amortization payments prior to maturity.
36
the new term loan facilities, excluding the term loan b-2, require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. we will pay certain commitment fees in connection with the new revolving credit facility. the term loan b-2 required us to pay a 2.0% prepayment fee if it was repaid in the second year after the refinance date and requires us to pay a 1.0% prepayment fee if it is repaid in the third year after the refinance date.
on january 26, 2016, we prepaid $1.0 billion of the $3.3 billion term loan b-1.
on august 30, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "third amendment") to the new senior secured credit facilities. the third amendment reduced the applicable interest rate margin with respect to the term loan a tranche of our new term loan facilities, which had $937.5 million outstanding immediately prior to the date of the third amendment, and our new revolving credit facility, which was undrawn other than letters of credit immediately prior to the date of the third amendment. the reduction in the interest rate margins was accomplished by replacing the existing term loan a tranche with a new term loan a-1 tranche and the new revolving credit facility with new revolving facility commitments (the "tranche a revolving credit facility") that, except as set forth below, have terms identical to the existing term loan a tranche and new revolving credit facility. as a result, the total amount borrowed under the third amendment was unchanged from the total amount borrowed under the new senior secured credit facilities.
loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche bore interest at libor plus 1.75% annually (or a base rate plus 0.75%) until we delivered our quarterly compliance certificate to the lenders outlining our secured net leverage ratio for the quarter ended january 28, 2017. prior to that date, we paid a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility of 0.30% annually. after january 28, 2017, loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche bear interest at libor plus 1.50% to 2.25% or at a base rate plus 0.50% to 1.25% and we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% (in each case, determined based on our secured net leverage ratio).
beginning on january 13, 2017, loans made under the term loan a-1 tranche required quarterly amortization payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount until april 15, 2017. after april 15, 2017, loans made under the term loan a-1 tranche require quarterly amortization payments of 1.875% of the original principal amount.
the restrictive covenants and events of default in the third amendment are unchanged from the provisions in the new senior secured credit facilities.
on september 22, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "fourth amendment") to the new senior secured credit facilities. the fourth amendment provided for an additional $1,275.0 million in additional principal amounts under the term loan a-1 tranche and $750.0 million in total principal amount of term loan b-3. the proceeds of the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 were used to prepay the $2,025.0 million of existing term loan b-1. in addition, we used $242.0 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b-1.
the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche have terms identical to the term loan a-1 tranche made under the third amendment to the new senior secured credit facilities. the term loan b-3 had terms identical to the term loan b-1 under the new senior secured credit facilities, except as set forth below.
the term loan b-3 bore interest at libor plus 2.50% annually (or a base rate plus 1.50%).
beginning on january 13, 2017, the term loan b-3 required quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount until maturity.
the obligations and additional loans under the tranche a revolving credit facilities, the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 are secured by the same collateral and subject to the same guarantees as the other classes of loans under the new senior secured credit facilities. the restrictive covenants and events of default in the fourth amendment are substantially the same as the provisions in the new senior secured credit facilities.
on january 20, 2017, we prepaid the $748.1 million remaining outstanding under the term loan b-3.
on july 27, 2017, we prepaid $500.0 million of the then outstanding $2.2 billion under the term loan a-1. the prepayment resulted in an acceleration of the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the term loan a-1 of $1.2 million.
historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. at february 3, 2018, we have $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.

funding requirements overview, including off-balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2018 to total approximately $371.3 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.
at february 3, 2018, we have $1,250.0 million available under our tranche a revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $158.2 million.
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are between $875.0 million and $890.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 500 new and existing dollar tree banner stores, the expansion of freezers and coolers in 500 family dollar stores, 450 planned renovations of family dollar banner stores and the final phases of construction of a new dollar tree banner distribution center and the expansion of our chesapeake, virginia store support center. we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our tranche a revolving credit facility.

lease financing operating lease obligations. our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february 3, 2018 for stores that were not yet open on february 3, 2018.
long-term borrowings acquisition notes. in february 2015, we completed the offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due march 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due march 1, 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. on august 1, 2016, we completed the exchange of the acquisition notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms. the acquisition notes are fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries which guarantee the obligations under our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries. interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 and commenced on september 1, 2015. on january 30, 2018, we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the $750.0 million 2020 notes on march 1, 2018. in connection with the early redemption of our 2020 notes, we recorded a make-whole premium of $9.8 million which was payable on the call date of march 1, 2018. we paid the $759.8 million on march 1, 2018. the remaining $6.1 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs at february 3, 2018 were fully expensed at

the call date of march 1, 2018. for complete terms of the acquisition notes please see "note 6 - long-term debt" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k.
credit facility and term loans. on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consisted of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date. upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term loan b-1 and $650.0 million of 4.25% fixed-rate term loan b-2.
on january 26, 2016, we prepaid $1.0 billion of the $3.3 billion term loan b-1.
on august 30, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan a tranche and the new revolving credit facility by replacing the existing term loan a tranche with a new term loan a-1 tranche and the new revolving credit facility with new revolving facility commitments (the "tranche a revolving credit facility"), reducing the applicable interest rate margins.
on september 22, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to provide for $1,275.0 million in additional principal amounts under the term loan a-1 tranche and $750.0 million in total principal amount of term loan b-3. the proceeds of the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 were used to prepay the $2,025.0 million of existing term loan b-1. in addition, we used $242.0 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b-1.
loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche bear interest at libor plus 1.50% to 2.25% or at a base rate plus 0.50% to 1.25% and we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% (in each case, determined based on our secured net leverage ratio). the term loan b-3 bore interest at libor plus 2.50% annually (or a base rate plus 1.50%).
on january 20, 2017, we prepaid the $748.1 million remaining outstanding under the term loan b-3.
on july 27, 2017, we prepaid $500.0 million of the then outstanding $2.2 billion under the term loan a-1.
for complete terms of the credit facility and term loans please see "note 6 - long-term debt" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k.
secured senior notes. we assumed the liability for $300.0 million of 5.0% senior notes due february 1, 2021 which were issued by family dollar on january 28, 2011 through a public offering. these unsecured notes became secured upon closing of the acquisition. these notes are equally and ratably secured with the term loans.
interest on long-term borrowings. these amounts represent interest payments on the acquisition notes, term loans and senior secured notes using the interest rates for each at february 3, 2018.
commitments letters of credit and surety bonds. we are a party to three letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, for letters of credit. letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $168.0 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february 3, 2018.
we also have approximately $158.2 million of letters of credit outstanding that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and $86.2 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores and self-insured insurance programs.
39
purchase obligations. we have commitments totaling approximately $130.3 million related to legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" under the caption "merchandise inventories" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at february 3, 2018 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2017, including the fourth quarter. we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink. the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
accrued expenses on a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. certain expenses require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates are for our self-insurance accruals for workers' compensation and general liability costs. these accruals are recorded based on third-party actuarial valuations which we obtain at least annually. these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. we estimate
40
the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions.
the family dollar goodwill and tradename comprise a substantial portion of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and the management judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and tradename impairment evaluations is critical. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include:
•   the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expenses. the cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our fiscal 2017 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•   selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 9.0% for our fiscal 2017 analysis.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar tradename, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. the discount rate is consistent with the discount rate used in our family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation adjusted for revenue-specific growth risk.
our impairment evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. the fair value of the family dollar reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
income taxes our income tax provision is estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors. recent changes in tax law have been significant and the application of new laws requires management estimates and judgment. see "note 4 - income taxes" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k for a detailed description of the impact of the tcja.
historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 43 of this form 10-k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

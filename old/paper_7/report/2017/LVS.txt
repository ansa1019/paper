key operating revenue measurements operating revenues at the venetian macao, sands cotai central, the parisian macao, the plaza macao and four seasons hotel macao, marina bay sands and our las vegas operating properties are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. operating revenues at sands macao and sands bethlehem are principally driven by casino customers who visit the properties on a daily basis.
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues:
casino revenue measurements for macao and singapore: macao and singapore table games are segregated into two groups: rolling chip play (composed of vip players) and non-rolling chip play (mostly non-vip players). the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. the volume measurement for non-rolling chip play is table games drop ("drop"), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased at the cage. rolling chip and non-rolling chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume. the amounts wagered and lost for rolling chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for non-rolling chip play. slot handle ("handle"), also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.
we view rolling chip win as a percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle. win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. beginning with the three months ended march 31, 2017, we revised the expected range for our macao
45
operations due to the rolling chip win percentage experienced over the last several years. our rolling chip win percentage (calculated before discounts and commissions) is expected to be 3.0% to 3.3% in macao and 2.7% to 3.0% in singapore. actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages. generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. in macao and singapore, 15.4% and 34.1%, respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended december 31, 2017.
casino revenue measurements for the u.s.: the volume measurements in the u.s. are slot handle, as previously described, and table games drop, which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in the table drop box. we view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of handle. beginning with the three months ended march 31, 2017, we revised the expected range for our las vegas operating properties due to the win percentage experienced over the last several years. based upon our mix of table games, our table games are expected to produce a win percentage (calculated before discounts) of 18% to 26% for baccarat and 16% to 24% for non-baccarat. actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and the trailing 12-month win and hold percentages. similar to macao and singapore, slot machine play is generally conducted on a cash basis. approximately 59.8% of our table games play at our las vegas operating properties, for the year ended december 31, 2017, was conducted on a credit basis, while our table games play in pennsylvania is primarily conducted on a cash basis.
hotel revenue measurements: performance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period and average daily room rate ("adr", a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements. the calculations of the occupancy rate and adr include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail (or cash) room rates by type of customer and room product to ensure the complimentary room rates are consistent with retail rates. revenue per available room ("revpar") represents a summary of hotel adr and occupancy. because not all available rooms are occupied, adr is normally higher than revpar. reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests.
mall revenue measurements: occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area ("gloa") divided by gross leasable area ("gla") at the end of the reporting period. gloa is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. gla does not include space that is currently under development or not on the market for lease. base rent per square foot is the weighted average base, or minimum, rent charge in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.

consolidated net revenues were $12.88 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $1.47 billion compared to $11.41 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases of $1.02 billion at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, and $355 million at marina bay sands, primarily due to increased casino revenues.
casino revenues increased $1.29 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was due to increases of $911 million at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, and $357 million at marina bay sands, driven by increases in rolling chip win percentage and volume. the following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:

room revenues increased $92 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases of $95 million at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, and $21 million at sands cotai central, driven by increased occupancy and average daily room rates, partially offset by an $18 million decrease at marina bay sands, driven by decreased occupancy. the suites at sands macao are primarily provided to casino patrons on a complimentary basis. during the year ended december 31, 2017, there were approximately 9%, 8% and 4% fewer rooms available at the plaza macao and four seasons hotel macao, the venetian macao and marina bay sands, respectively, compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the following table summarizes the results of our room activity:

operating expenses were $9.42 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $503 million compared to $8.92 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in operating expenses was driven by the opening of the parisian macao in september 2016.
casino expenses increased $564 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to increases of $585 million at the parisian macao and $40 million at marina bay sands, driven by an increase in gaming tax, partially offset by a $48 million decrease at our macao operations (excluding the parisian macao), driven by a $22 million decrease in gaming taxes due to decreased casino revenues.
the provision for doubtful accounts was $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $173 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease resulted from increased collections of previously reserved customer balances during year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year period, and continuing improvement in the quality of casino credit currently being extended. the amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time. we believe that the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.
general and administrative expenses increased $131 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to an $89 million increase at the parisian macao and increases of $18 million at our las vegas operating properties, driven by an increase in marketing and advertising efforts, and $12 million at the venetian macao driven by an increase in payroll and related expenses.
corporate expenses decreased $82 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily due to nonrecurring legal costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016.
pre-opening expense represents personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. pre-opening expenses decreased $121 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to the parisian macao. development expenses include the costs associated with the company's evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are also expensed as incurred.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $60 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase is primarily attributable to a $144 million increase at the parisian macao, partially offset by a $112 million decrease resulting from a change in the estimated useful lives of certain property and equipment (see "item 8 - financial
51
statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies - property and equipment").
loss on disposal or impairment of assets was $20 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $79 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the loss for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily related to dispositions at our macao and u.s. operations.
adjusted property ebitda consolidated adjusted property ebitda, which is a non-gaap financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. consolidated adjusted property ebitda is net income before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. consolidated adjusted property ebitda is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. in particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property ebitda to compare the operating profitability of its operations with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. integrated resort companies have historically reported adjusted property ebitda as a supplemental performance measure to gaap financial measures. in order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, integrated resort companies, including las vegas sands corp., have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property ebitda calculations. consolidated adjusted property ebitda should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with gaap. we have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property ebitda. not all companies calculate adjusted property ebitda in the same manner. as a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
the following table summarizes information related to our segments (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 17 - segment information" for discussion of our operating segments and a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted property ebitda to net income):

adjusted property ebitda at our macao operations increased $363 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $298 million increase at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, and $43 million at the venetian macao, mainly due to increased casino operations, driven by an increase in non-rolling chip drop.
adjusted property ebitda at marina bay sands increased $366 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased casino revenues, driven by increases in rolling chip win percentage and volume. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in room revenues, driven by fewer rooms available due to renovations.
adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operating properties increased $35 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $49 million increase in net revenues (excluding intersegment royalty revenue), driven by increased convention and group meeting events benefiting food and beverage results and higher hold driving casino revenues, partially offset by an increase in marketing and advertising costs.

interest cost increased $21 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, resulting primarily from an increase in our weighted average total debt balance and a slight increase in our weighted average interest rate. capitalized interest decreased $32 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to the opening of the parisian macao in september 2016.
other factors effecting earnings other expense was $94 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to other income of $31 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. other expense during the year ended december 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to a depreciation of the u.s. dollar versus the singapore dollar during the period. this resulted in $83 million of foreign currency transaction losses, driven by singapore dollar denominated intercompany debt reported in u.s. dollars, and a $12 million fair value adjustment on our singapore forward contracts.
the loss on modification or early retirement of debt was $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, and primarily related the amendment to the 2013 u.s. credit facility (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2013 u.s. credit facility").
our effective income tax rate was (6.8)% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 10.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease in the effective income tax rate relates primarily to the release of certain valuation allowances as a result of u.s. tax reform. the act made significant changes to u.s. income tax laws including lowering the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21% effective beginning in 2018 and transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system resulting in dividends from our foreign subsidiaries not being subject to u.s. income tax and creating a one-time tax on previously unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
53
our effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 10.4% without the one-time discrete benefit of $526 million recorded as a result of u.s. tax reform. the effective income tax rates reflect a 17% statutory tax rate on our singapore operations and a zero percent tax rate on our macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in macao, which expires at the end of 2018. in december 2017, we requested an additional income tax exemption for either an additional 5-year period or through june 26, 2022, the end of our subconcession agreement. we have recorded a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets generated by operations in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions; however, to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that these deferred tax assets or a portion thereof are realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowances in the period such determination is made as appropriate.
the net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests was $455 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $346 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of scl and reflect the increased net income generated by scl in 2017.

consolidated net revenues were $11.41 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of $278 million compared to $11.69 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in net revenues was driven by decreases of $168 million at our macao operations and $153 million at marina bay sands, primarily due to decreased casino revenues, partially offset by a $29 million increase at our las vegas operating properties, driven by increased room revenues.
casino revenues decreased $312 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease is primarily due to decreases of $522 million at our macao properties (excluding the parisian macao), driven by a decrease in rolling chip volume as demand has decreased in the vip market, and $152 million at marina bay sands, driven by a decrease in rolling chip volume and win percentage, as well as a decrease in non-rolling chip drop. these decreases were partially offset by $359 million in revenues attributable to the parisian macao. the following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:

room revenues increased $57 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase is primarily due to increases of $43 million at our las vegas operating properties and $17 million at marina bay sands, driven by increased occupancy and average daily room rates. our macao properties decreased $3 million, due to a $39 million decrease at our properties (excluding the parisian macao) driven by the slowdown in the overall macao gaming industry, partially offset by $36 million in revenues attributable to the parisian macao. the suites at sands macao are primarily provided to casino patrons on a complimentary basis. the following table summarizes the results of our room activity:

operating expenses were $8.92 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $70 million compared to $8.85 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to operating expenses of $299 million at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, a $112 million increase in depreciation and amortization, and an $82 million increase in pre-opening expenses related to the opening of the parisian macao. these increases were partially offset by a $419 million decrease in casino expenses at our macao operations (excluding the parisian macao).
casino expenses decreased $276 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. of the decrease, $114 million was due to the 39% gross win tax on decreased casino revenues at our macao properties. the remaining decrease is primarily due to decreases in junket commissions and our cost control and cost avoidance initiatives at our macao properties (excluding the parisian macao), including the transition of personnel to pre-opening in advance of and in connection with the opening of the parisian macao, and decreases in casino expenses at our las vegas operating properties and marina bay sands. these decreases were partially offset by casino expenses attributable to the parisian macao.
the provision for doubtful accounts was $173 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $156 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time. we believe that the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.
corporate expenses increased $80 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to nonrecurring legal costs.
pre-opening expenses were $130 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $48 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. pre-opening expense represents personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. pre-opening expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily related to activities at the parisian macao. development expenses include the costs associated with the company's evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are also expensed as incurred.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $112 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase is primarily attributable to $57 million of expenses at the parisian macao and a $38 million increase at marina bay sands, driven by the acceleration of depreciation of certain assets due to room renovations.

adjusted property ebitda at our integrated resorts is primarily driven by our casino, room and mall operations, as previously discussed.
adjusted property ebitda at our macao operations increased $22 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to $114 million in adjusted property ebitda generated at the parisian macao, which opened in september 2016, and cost control and cost avoidance initiatives at our other macao properties. this increase was partially offset by decreases at sands macao, sands cotai central and the plaza macao and four seasons hotel macao, driven by decreased casino revenues due to lower demand in the vip market.
adjusted property ebitda at marina bay sands decreased $118 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in casino operations, driven by decreases in rolling chip volume and win percentage, as well as a decrease in non-rolling chip drop.
adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operating properties increased $51 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to increased room revenues, partially offset by a decrease in casino operations.
adjusted property ebitda at sands bethlehem increased $5 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to a $22 million increase in net revenues, driven by an increase in casino revenues, partially offset by an increase in the associated expenses.

interest cost increased $15 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting primarily from an increase in our weighted average total debt balance. capitalized interest increased $6 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to the construction of the parisian macao.
other factors effecting earnings other income was $31 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. other income during the year ended december 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to $20 million of foreign currency transaction gains, driven by singapore dollar denominated intercompany debt held in the u.s., and a $10 million fair value adjustment on our singapore forward contracts. these gains resulted from the appreciation of the u.s. dollar versus the singapore dollar.
the loss on modification or early retirement of debt was $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, and primarily related to amendments to the 2013 u.s. credit facility (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2013 u.s. credit facility").
our effective income tax rate was 10.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 9.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in the effective income tax rate relates primarily to the valuation allowances recorded during the year ended december 31, 2016, as we determined that certain deferred tax assets were no longer "more-likely-than-not" realizable. the effective income tax rates reflect a 17% statutory tax rate on our singapore operations and a zero percent tax rate on our macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in macao, which expires at the end of 2018. we have recorded a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets generated by operations in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions; however, to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that these deferred tax assets or a portion thereof are realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowances in the period such determination is made as appropriate.
the net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests was $346 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $420 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of scl.

(2)   revenues from cam, levies and direct recoveries are included in minimum rents for the outlets at sands bethlehem.
(3)   minimum rents include base rents and straight-line adjustments of base rents.
(4)   commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in cotai. each property is also eligible to obtain an additional six-year exemption, provided certain qualifications are met. to date, the venetian macao and the plaza macao and four seasons hotel macao have obtained a second exemption, extending the property tax exemption to july 2019 and the end of july 2020, respectively. under the initial exemption, the parisian macao is tax exempt until the end of july 2022 and sands cotai central has a distinct exemption for each hotel tower, which have varying expiration dates that range from the end of march 2018 to the end of november 2021. the company is currently working on obtaining the second exemption for the parisian macao and sands cotai central.
(5)   mall-related expenses consist of cam, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for doubtful accounts, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs.
it is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income ("noi") as a useful supplemental measure of a mall's operating performance. because noi excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.
in the tables above, we believe that taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. as such, this calculation may not be comparable to the noi of other mall operating companies.
development projects we are constantly evaluating opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other revenue generating additions to our integrated resorts.
macao as of december 31, 2017, we have capitalized an aggregate of $12.58 billion in construction costs and land premiums for our cotai strip developments, which include the venetian macao, sands cotai central, the parisian macao and the plaza macao and four seasons hotel macao, as well as our investments in transportation infrastructure, including our passenger ferry service operations.
in october 2017, we announced that we will renovate, expand and rebrand the sands cotai central into a new destination integrated resort, the londoner macao, by adding extensive thematic elements both externally and internally. the londoner macao will feature new attractions and features from london, including some of london's most recognizable landmarks, an expanded retail mall and an additional 350 luxury suites. the project will commence in 2018 and be phased to minimize disruption during the property's peak periods. we expect the project to be completed in 2020.
in october 2017, we announced that the tower adjacent to the four seasons hotel macao will feature an additional 295 premium quality suites. we have completed the structural work of the tower and plan to commence build out of the suites in 2018. we expect the project to be completed in 2019.
united states we were constructing the las vegas condo tower, located on the las vegas strip between the palazzo and the venetian las vegas. in 2008, we suspended our construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for las vegas strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions. we continue to evaluate the highest return opportunity for the project and intend to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve. the impact of the suspension on the estimated overall cost of the project is currently not determinable with certainty. should demand and conditions fail to improve or management decides to abandon the project, we could record a charge for some portion of the $122 million in capitalized construction costs as of december 31, 2017.

other we continue to evaluate current development projects and pursue new development opportunities globally.

cash flows - operating activities table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. for the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash generated from operating activities increased $499 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating cash flows generated from our macao and singapore operations. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash generated from operating activities increased $585 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to changes in our working capital accounts, consisting primarily of changes in accounts receivable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by the decrease in net income.
cash flows - investing activities capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2017, totaled $837 million, including $479 million in macao, which consisted primarily of $204 million for the parisian macao, $153 million for the venetian macao and $86 million for sands cotai central; $196 million in singapore; $123 million at our las vegas operating properties; and $39 million for corporate and other activities.

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2015, totaled $1.53 billion, including $1.29 billion in macao, which consisted primarily of $767 million for the parisian macao and $403 million for sands cotai central;

$130 million in singapore; $78 million at our las vegas operating properties; and $29 million for corporate and other activities.
cash flows - financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.49 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, which was primarily attributable to $2.94 billion in dividend payments, $375 million in common stock repurchases, net repayments of $204 million on our various credit facilities, partially offset by proceeds of $40 million from the exercise of stock options.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $2.63 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was primarily attributable to $2.92 billion in dividend payments, partially offset by $309 million of net proceeds from our various credit facilities.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.22 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was primarily attributable to $2.71 billion in dividend payments, a net repayment of $413 million on our 2013 u.s. credit facility and $205 million in common stock repurchases, partially offset by $179 million of net proceeds on our 2011 vml credit facility.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $3.51 billion available for borrowing under our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, net of letters of credit.
capital financing overview we fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our credit facilities (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt") and operating cash flows.
our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants. the u.s. credit facility requires our las vegas operations to comply with a financial covenant at the end of each quarter to the extent that any revolving loans or certain letters of credit are outstanding. this financial covenant requires our las vegas operations to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined ("adjusted ebitda"). the maximum leverage ratio is 5.5x for all quarterly periods through maturity. we can elect to contribute cash on hand to our las vegas operations on a bi-quarterly basis; such contributions having the effect of increasing adjusted ebitda during the applicable quarter for purposes of calculating compliance with the maximum leverage ratio. our macao credit facility requires our macao operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda. the maximum leverage ratio is 3.5x for all quarterly periods through maturity. our singapore credit facility requires our marina bay sands operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda. the maximum leverage ratio is 3.5x for the quarterly periods ending december 31, 2017 through september 30, 2019, and then decreases to, and remains at, 3.0x for all quarterly periods thereafter through maturity. as of december 31, 2017, our u.s., macao and singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 0.5x, 1.7x and 1.8x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 5.5x, 3.5x and 3.5x, respectively. if we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities. any defaults or cross-defaults under these agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. if the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance any amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
we held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.42 billion and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $11 million as of december 31, 2017, of which approximately $1.67 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $1.67 billion, approximately $1.30 billion is available to be repatriated to the u.s. with minimal taxes owed on such amounts. u.s. tax reform created a one-time mandatory tax on the previously unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries upon transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. the foreign taxes paid on these earnings created a u.s. foreign tax credit that offsets this one-time tax. foreign earnings repatriated to the u.s. in the future will be exempt from u.s. income tax and we do not
64
expect significant withholding or other foreign taxes to apply to the repatriation of these earnings. the remaining unrestricted amounts held by non-u.s. subsidiaries are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third-party public shareholders in the case of funds being repatriated from scl. we believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $3.51 billion available for borrowing under our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, as of december 31, 2017, will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments. in the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and opportunities for enhancements thereof.
in march 2017, we amended our u.s. credit facility, which refinanced the term loans in an aggregate amount of $2.18 billion, extended the maturity of the term loans to march 2024, removed the requirement to prepay outstanding revolving loans and/or permanently reduce revolving commitments in certain circumstances and lowered the applicable margin credit spread for borrowings under the term loans (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2013 u.s. credit facility"). during the year ended december 31, 2017, we had net repayments of $67 million and $58 million on our singapore and u.s. credit facilities, respectively. subsequent to year-end, we borrowed $249 million under the 2016 vml revolving facility.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.73 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and recorded $2.31 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per common share and recorded $2.29 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share and recorded $2.07 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. in january 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share (a total estimated to be approximately $592 million) to be paid on march 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on march 22, 2018. we expect this level of dividend to continue quarterly through the remainder of 2018. our board of directors will continually assess the level and appropriateness of any cash dividends.
on february 24 and june 23, 2017, scl paid a dividend of 0.99 hong kong dollars ("hkd") and hkd 1.00 per share, respectively, to scl shareholders. on february 26 and june 24, 2016, scl paid a dividend of hkd 0.99 and hkd 1.00 per share, respectively, to scl shareholders. on february 27 and july 15, 2015, scl paid a dividend of hkd 0.99 and hkd 1.00 per share, respectively, to scl shareholders. the dividends totaled $2.07 billion, of which we retained $1.45 billion, during each of the three years ended december 31, 2017. in january 2018, the board of directors of scl declared a dividend of hkd 0.99 per share (a total of $1.02 billion, of which we will retain approximately $717 million) to scl shareholders of record on february 5, 2018, which is expected be paid on february 23, 2018.
in october 2014, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, which expired in october 2016. we repurchased 4,383,793 shares of our common stock for $205 million (including commissions) under this program during the year ended december 31, 2015. in november 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of $1.56 billion of our outstanding common stock, which expires in november 2018. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we repurchased 6,194,137 shares of our common stock for $375 million (including commissions) under this program. during the year ended december 31, 2016, no shares were repurchased. all share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

_______________________
(1)   as of december 31, 2017, we had a $30 million liability related to unrecognized tax benefits; we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.
(2)   see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt" for further details on these financing transactions.
(3)   based on the 1-month rates as of december 31, 2017, london inter-bank offered rate ("libor") of 1.56%, hong kong inter-bank offered rate ("hibor") of 1.19% and singapore swap offer rate ("sor") of 0.99% plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements.
(4)   in addition to the 39% gross gaming win tax in macao (which is not included in this table as the amount we pay is variable in nature), we are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. based on the gaming tables and gaming machines in operation as of december 31, 2017, the annual premium payable to the macao government is approximately $41 million through the termination of the gaming subconcession in june 2022.
(5)   mall deposits consist of refundable security deposits received from mall tenants.
(6)   we are party to certain operating leases for real estate, various equipment and service arrangements, which primarily include $136 million related to a 99-year lease agreement (86 years remaining) for a parking structure located adjacent to the venetian las vegas, $94 million related to certain leaseback agreements related to the sale of the grand canal shoppes and $80 million related to long-term land leases of 25 years with automatic extensions at our option of 10 years thereafter in accordance with macao law.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate caps and foreign currency forward contracts.
restrictions on distributions we are a parent company with limited business operations. our main asset is the stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. the debt instruments of our u.s., macao and singapore subsidiaries contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or equity interests, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase equity interests or certain indebtedness, create certain liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain mergers or consolidations or sell our assets of our company without prior approval of the lenders or noteholders.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. these estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful casino accounts we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at our operating casino resorts in macao, singapore and the u.s., which we regularly evaluate. we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information, and we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under the specified dollar amount. we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves. credit or marker play was 15.4%, 34.1% and 59.8% of table games play at our macao properties, marina bay sands and las vegas operating properties, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2017. our table games play in pennsylvania is primarily conducted on a cash basis. our allowance for
68
doubtful casino accounts was 51.5% and 47.7% of gross casino receivables as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the credit extended to junket operators can be offset by the commissions payable to said junket operators, which is considered in the establishment of the allowance for doubtful accounts. our allowance for doubtful accounts from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
litigation accrual we are subject to various claims and legal actions. we estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined that such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
property and equipment at december 31, 2017, we had net property and equipment of $15.52 billion, representing 75.0% of our total assets. we depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations, such as contractual life. future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition, or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. the estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis.
for assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. if an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. we estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
to estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.
for assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies - property and equipment").
indefinite useful life assets as of december 31, 2017, we had a $50 million asset related to our sands bethlehem gaming license and a $17 million asset related to our sands bethlehem table games certificate, both of which were determined to have indefinite useful lives. assets with indefinite useful lives are assessed regularly to ensure they continue to meet the indefinite useful life criteria. these assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment and recoverability annually
69
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. when performing our impairment analysis, we may first conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether we believe it is "more-likely-than-not" that the asset is impaired. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and we determine it is "more-likely-than-not" that the asset is impaired after assessing the qualitative factors, we then perform an impairment test that consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. if the fair value of the asset exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment is recognized. if the fair value of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount, an impairment will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference.
if we determine a qualitative assessment is to be performed, we assess certain qualitative factors including, but not limited to, the results of the most recent fair value calculation, operating results and projected operating results, and macro-economic and industry conditions.
future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in operating results, macro-economic factors or management's intentions may result in future changes to the fair value of the gaming license and table games certificate.
stock-based compensation accounting standards regarding share-based payments require the recognition of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value of employee stock-based compensation. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividends. expected volatilities are based on our historical volatility. the expected option life is based on the contractual term of the option as well historical exercise and forfeiture behavior. the expected dividend yield is based on our estimate of annual dividends expected to be paid at the time of the grant. we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock options granted. we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than based upon an estimated rate. all employee stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value (as defined in the company's equity award plans).
during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $34 million and $35 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, under the lvsc 2004 plan there was $32 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock and stock units, collectively. the stock option and restricted stock and stock unit costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years and 0.4 years, respectively.
as of december 31, 2017, under the scl equity plan there was $20 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units, collectively. the stock option and restricted stock unit costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years and 0.2 years, respectively.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
our foreign and u.s. tax rate differential reflects the fact that income earned in singapore and macao is taxed at local rates, which are lower than u.s. tax rates. we received a 5-year income tax exemption in macao that exempts us from paying corporate income tax on profits generated by gaming operations. we will continue to benefit from this tax exemption through the end of 2018. in december 2017, we requested an additional income tax exemption for either an additional 5-year period or through june 26, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expires.
accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" that such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory
70
carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring, and implementation of tax planning strategies.
we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $261 million and $234 million, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our u.s. operations of $4.43 billion and $3.96 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the applicable accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made as appropriate.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the tax treatment is uncertain. accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. we recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $92 million and $74 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
our major tax jurisdictions are the u.s., macao, and singapore. we are subject to examination for years beginning 2010 in the u.s. and for years beginning 2013 in macao and singapore.
u.s. tax reform made significant changes to u.s. income tax laws including lowering the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21% effective beginning in 2018 and transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system resulting in dividends from our foreign subsidiaries not being subject to u.s. income tax and creating a one-time tax on previously unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $526 million relating to the reduction of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that were previously determined not likely to be utilized and also the revaluation of our u.s. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate of 21%.
we recorded the impact of enactment of u.s. tax reform subject to staff accounting bulletin ("sab") 118, which provides for a twelve-month remeasurement period to complete the accounting required under accounting standards codification ("asc") 740. while we believe these provisional amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the ultimate enactment-related impact that u.s. tax reform will have on our consolidated financial statements, it is possible that we may materially adjust these amounts for related administrative guidance, notices, implementing regulations, potential legislative amendments and interpretations as the new tax law evolves. these adjustments could have an impact on our tax assets and liabilities, effective tax rate and earnings per share.

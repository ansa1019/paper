item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those listed under "risks factors."
executive level overview trimble inc. is a leading provider of technology solutions that optimize the work processes of office and mobile field professionals around the world. our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including agriculture, architecture, civil engineering, construction, government, natural resources, transportation and utilities. representative trimble customers include engineering and construction firms, contractors, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, transportation and logistics companies, energy, utility companies, and state, federal and municipal governments.
trimble focuses on integrating its broad technological and application capabilities to create vertically-focused, system-level solutions that transform how work is done within the industries we serve. the integration of sensors, software, connectivity, and information in our portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide an information model specific to the customer's workflow. for example, in construction, our strategy is centered on the concept of a "constructible model" which is at the center of our "connected site" solutions which provide real-time, connected, and cohesive information environments for the design, build, and operational phases of construction projects. in agriculture, we continue to develop "connected farm" solutions to optimize operations across the agriculture workflow. in transportation and logistics, our "connected fleet" solutions provide transportation companies with tools to enhance fuel efficiency, safety, and transparency through connected vehicles and fleets across the enterprise.
our growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:
•   focus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential - we focus on large markets historically underserved by technology that offer significant potential for long-term revenue growth, profitability and market leadership. our core industries such as construction, agriculture, and transportation markets are each multi-trillion dollar global industries which operate in increasingly demanding environments with technology adoption in the early phases relative to other industries. with the emergence of mobile computing capabilities, the increasing technological know-how of end users and the compelling return on investment to our customers, we believe many of our markets are attractive for substituting trimble's technology and solutions in place of traditional operating methods.
•   domain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base - we have over time redefined our technological focus from hardware-driven point solutions to integrated work process solutions by developing domain expertise and heavily reinvesting in r&amp;d and acquisitions. we have been spending approximately 14% to 15% of revenue over the past several years on r&amp;d and currently have over 1,200 unique patents. we intend to continue to take advantage of our technology portfolio and deep domain knowledge to quickly and cost-effectively deliver specific, targeted solutions to each of the vertical markets we serve. we look for opportunities where the opportunity for technological change is high and which have a requirement for the integration of multiple technologies into complete vertical solutions.
•   increasing focus on software and services - software and services targeted for the needs of vertical end markets are increasingly important elements of our solutions and are core to our growth strategy. trimble has an open application programming interface philosophy and open vendor environment which leads to increased adoption of our software and analytics offerings. we believe that increased recurring revenue from these solutions will provide us with enhanced business visibility over time. professional services constitute an additional growth channel that helps our customers integrate and optimize the use of our offerings in their environment.
•   geographic expansion with localization strategy - we view international expansion as an important element of our strategy and we continue to position ourselves in geographic markets that will serve as important sources of future growth. we currently have a physical presence in over 40 countries and distribution channels in over 100 countries. in 2017, over 50% of our sales were to customers located in countries outside of the u.s.
•   optimized go to market strategies to best access our markets - we utilize vertically focused go-to-market strategies that leverage domain expertise to best serve the needs of individual markets domestically and abroad. these go to market capabilities include independent dealers, joint ventures, original equipment manufacturers ("oem") sales, and distribution alliances with key partners, such as cnh global, caterpillar, and nikon, as well as direct sales to end-users, that provide us with broad market reach and localization capabilities to effectively serve our markets.
•   strategic acquisitions - organic growth continues to be our primary focus, while acquisitions serve to enhance our market position. we acquire businesses that bring domain expertise, technology, products, or distribution capabilities that augment our portfolio and allow us to penetrate existing markets more effectively, or to establish a market beachhead. our success in targeting and effectively integrating acquisitions is an important aspect of our growth strategy.
30
trimble's focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability as well as an increasingly diversified business model. software and services growth is driving increased recurring revenue, leading to improved visibility in some of our businesses. as our solutions have expanded, our go to market model has also evolved, with a balanced mix between direct, distribution and oem customers, and an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs of sales, operating expenses, and related disclosures. we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies. these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k.
the following summary of our accounting policies does not give the effect to the adoption of asc 606 which became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.
contracts and/or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses, as well as the customer's payment history.
revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. our shipment terms for u.s. orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point. if no precise point is indicated by the buyer, delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us. other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer. shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
revenue from sales to distributors and dealers is recognized upon shipment, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. distributors and dealers do not have a right of return.
revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support ("pcs") agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period. revenue from our subscription services related to our hardware and applications is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription service period beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs. we generally have established vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate. the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method. license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements. in cases where vsoe of fair value for pcs is not established, revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs period after all software deliverables have been made and the only the undelivered element is pcs.
for services performed on a fixed-fee basis, revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method, with performance measured based on hours of work performed. for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software, the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method or, if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services, we use the completed-contract
31
method of accounting.  a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or when acceptance from the customer has been received.
some of our subscription product offerings include hardware, subscription services and extended warranty. under these hosted arrangements, the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a third-party's hardware.
our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware, extended warranty, software, pcs services and subscription services, which are considered separate units of accounting. for certain of our products, software and non-software components function together to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality.
in evaluating the revenue recognition for our hardware or subscription agreements which contain multiple deliverables, we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis, did not price products within a narrow range, or had a limited sales history. when vsoe cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant third-party evidence ("tpe"). tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. our offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology, customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. therefore, we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe.
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use our best estimate of selling price ("besp") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, geographies and gross margin. the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategy.
income taxes we are a united states-based multinational company operating in multiple u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.
we are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the irs, state, local and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted into law, which significantly changes u.s income tax law and includes several key provisions that affect our business, including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective in 2018, among others. we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, re-measuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. in addition, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax act ("sab 118"), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next year, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, indefinite reinvestment assertion, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and our tax positions. in addition, we have not yet determined our policy election as to whether we will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low taxed income ("gilti") or whether we will account for gilti as a period cost, if and when incurred. we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118.
32
business combinations and valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.
when determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights, patents, licenses, technology, acquired backlog, trademarks, and in-process research and development. amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
we evaluate goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year based on the values on the first day of that quarter. goodwill was reviewed for impairment utilizing a quantitative two-step process. when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the discounted cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets. changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business model, or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets differing from initial estimates. in cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised, the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be depreciated over its revised remaining useful life. these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows. the estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance and these estimates may differ from actual future cash flows. the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, based on estimated fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. the awards include restricted stock units with time-based, market-based and performance-based vesting conditions, rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan, and stock options.
the determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and any expected dividends. in addition, the binomial model incorporates actual option-pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option's contractual term.
the fair value of restricted stock units with market-based vesting conditions is valued at the grant date using a monte carlo simulation. the monte carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the binomial option pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market-based vesting conditions may not be satisfied and the impact of the possible differing stock price paths for trimble and each of the constituents of the s&p 500. the fair value of our time-based and performance-based restricted stock units is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the total expense associated with the performance-based awards is based upon the expected achievement of the underlying performance goals and may be adjusted in future periods based upon changes in expectations and actual achievement.
the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of our options is estimated using a binomial valuation model.
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our share-based payment awards granted in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.
33
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, including the achievement of performance-based goals and estimated forfeitures. if the performance goals achieved are different from what had been estimated or actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimates, stock-based compensation recognized may not be reflective of what was earned in that period.
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances. factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand which impact inventory purchasing forecasts, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. if our estimates used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory are different from what we expected, we may be required to recognize additional reserves, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

basis of presentation we have a 52-53 week fiscal year, ending on the friday nearest to december 31, which for fiscal 2017 was december 29, 2017. fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were all 52-week years.
revenue in fiscal 2017, total revenue increased by $292.0 million, or 12%, to $2.65 billion from $2.36 billion in fiscal 2016. overall revenue increased primarily due to organic growth across all segments and major regions. to a lesser extent, acquisitions contributed to growth, particularly in product and service revenue. we consider organic growth to include all revenue except for revenue associated with acquisitions made within the last four quarters.
on a segment basis, the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to transportation, buildings and infrastructure, resources and utilities, and to a lesser extent, geospatial. transportation increased $92.9 million, or 16%, buildings and infrastructure revenue increased $91.4 million, or 12%, resources and utilities revenue increased $81.2 million, or 21%, and geospatial revenue increased $26.5 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2016. transportation revenue increased due to continued organic growth in the transportation and logistics business. buildings and infrastructure revenue increased primarily due to strong organic growth in civil engineering and construction and building construction. resources and utilities revenue increased primarily due to acquisitions, in particular the impact of the müller-elektronik (" müller") acquisition, and continued organic growth in agriculture, correction services, and forestry. geospatial revenue increased mainly due to strong geospatial and surveying organic growth.
by revenue category, overall product revenue increased $201.8 million, or 13%, service revenue increased $31.4 million, or 7%, and subscription revenue increased $58.8 million, or 16%. product, service and subscription revenue increased primarily due to organic growth across all segments. to a lesser extent, acquisitions contributed to growth, particularly in product and service revenue.
34
in fiscal 2016, total revenue increased by $71.8 million, or 3%, to $2.36 billion from $2.29 billion in fiscal 2015. overall revenue was primarily impacted by organic growth in building construction, civil engineering and construction, and transportation and logistics, partially offset by declines in geospatial and gis.
on a segment basis, the increase in fiscal 2016 revenue was primarily due to buildings and infrastructure and transportation, to a lesser extent resources and utilities, partially offset by a slight decline in geospatial. buildings and infrastructure revenue increased $54.9 million, or 8%, resources and utilities revenue increased $13.9 million, or 4%, transportation increased $41.1 million, or 8%, partially offset by a decrease in geospatial revenue of $38.1 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2015. buildings and infrastructure revenue increased driven by building construction and civil engineering and construction. resources and utilities revenue was up due to slight growth in our agriculture business. transportation revenue increased due to continued growth in the transportation and logistics market. geospatial revenue decreased due to continued challenges in north american markets due to the impact of oil and gas market softness, which continued to reduce product demand.
by revenue category, overall product revenue increased $28.5 million, or 2%, service revenue increased $10.3 million, or 2%, and subscription revenue increased $33.0 million, or 10%. the product revenue increase was primarily within buildings and infrastructure and transportation, partially offset by declines in geospatial. service and subscription increases were primarily due to organic growth within buildings and infrastructure and transportation as we continue to expand software and services, including implementation, maintenance and subscription services, as a portion of our revenue.
during fiscal 2017, sales to customers in the united states represented 48%, europe represented 26%, asia pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. during fiscal 2016, sales to customers in the united states represented 49%, europe represented 24%, asia pacific represented 15%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. during fiscal 2015, sales to customers in the united states represented 50%, europe represented 24%, asia pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue.
no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable as of fiscal years ended 2017 and 2016.
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix, pricing, distribution channel, production volumes, new product start-up costs, and foreign currency translations.
in fiscal 2017, our gross margin increased by $154.6 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased revenue across all segments - buildings and infrastructure, transportation, resources and utilities, and, to a lesser extent, geospatial. gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 52.5% in fiscal 2017 and 52.4% in fiscal 2016. the slight increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower intangibles amortization due to fully amortized intangibles from prior acquisitions, partially offset by intangibles from new acquisitions. excluding the impact of intangibles amortization, gross margin percentage slightly decreased due to the impact of acquisitions, particularly müller.
in fiscal 2016, our gross margin increased by $35.8 million as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenue in buildings and infrastructure, resources and utilities and transportation. gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 52.4% in fiscal 2016 and 52.5% in fiscal 2015. the slight decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily in geospatial and transportation due to product mix, partially offset by lower amortization of purchased intangible assets.
operating income operating income increased by $65.0 million for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2017 was 9.3% as compared to 7.7% for fiscal 2016. the increases in operating income and operating income percentage were attributable to revenue expansion and strong operating control in buildings and infrastructure, and to a lesser extent transportation, resources and utilities, and geospatial. operating income was partially offset by higher corporate expense.
operating income increased by $26.6 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2016 was 7.7% as compared to 6.7% for fiscal 2015. the increase in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to revenue expansion in buildings and infrastructure and transportation, the effects of strong operating expense control across the company and lower amortization of purchased intangible assets.
35
results by segment in march 2017, we effected a change in the reporting of our segment financial results to better reflect our customer base and end markets. beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are reporting our financial performance, including revenues and operating income, based on four new reportable segments: buildings and infrastructure, geospatial, resources and utilities, and transportation. comparative period financial information by reportable segment has been recast to conform with the current presentation.
operating income is revenue less cost of sales and operating expense, excluding unallocated corporate expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition and divestiture items, executive transition costs and litigation costs.
the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below.

income tax provision our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 53%, 25% and 20%, respectively.  the fiscal 2017 rate was higher than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the tax act, partially offset by the geographic mix of pretax income, the u.s. federal r&d credit, and stock-based compensation tax benefits. the fiscal 2016 rate was less than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the geographic mix of pre-tax income, a divestiture of a non-strategic business, and the u.s. federal r&d credit. the fiscal 2015 rate was less than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the geographical mix of our pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of the current year u.s. federal r&d credit.
the tax act introduces significant changes to u.s. income tax law. effective in 2018, the tax act reduces the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as gilti and the base erosion avoidance tax ("beat"), respectively. in addition, in 2017 we are subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax. accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act requires significant judgments and estimates.
39
in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $85.0 million in fiscal year 2017. this discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of a $126.0 million expense for the transition tax, a $46.7 million benefit for adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with foreign earnings and tax reserves due to the transition tax, a $3.3 million net expense for re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the u.s. corporate tax rate reduction, and a $2.4 million expense for state tax and foreign withholding taxes.
pursuant to sab 118, we recorded reasonable estimates as provisional amounts arising from the tax act in fiscal year 2017. these amounts include but are not limited to the amounts described above, including the transition tax. in addition, we have not yet determined our policy election as to whether we will recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as gilti or whether we will account for gilti as a period cost if and when incurred. we intend to perform additional analysis regarding historical foreign earnings and taxes as well as any other necessary potential adjustments and will complete the analysis within the one year measurement period by incorporating the additional analysis as well as ongoing legislation guidance and accounting interpretations.
off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business (see contractual obligations table below), we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. we do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. additionally, we do not have any interest in, or relationship with, any special purpose entities.
in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. from time to time, in connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets, we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business, such as breaches of representations, covenants or excluded liabilities. in addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016.

cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2017, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $537.4 million compared to $327.2 million at the end of fiscal 2016. we had a principal balance of outstanding debt of $918.2 million at the end of fiscal 2017 compared to

$624.8 million at the end of fiscal 2016. as a result of the 2017 tax act, we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the u.s. when needed with minimal u.s. income tax consequences other than the transition tax. we have reinvested a large portion of our undistributed foreign earnings in acquisitions and other investments and we intend to bring back a portion of foreign cash which was subject to the transition tax. for further information on the transition tax, refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability, the rate of collections of accounts receivable, our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital.
our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk. our investment policy requires the portfolio to include only securities with high credit quality and a weighted average maturity not to exceed six months, with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. we classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and borrowings under our 2014 credit facility and 2018 interim credit facility as described below under the heading "debt", will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, debt service, planned capital expenditures, our $500.0 million acquisition of e-builder, a florida corporation, and stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $411.9 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to $413.6 million for fiscal 2016. the decrease of $1.7 million was primarily driven by revenue expansion across all segments, partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements, driven by inventory requirements and accounts receivable, associated with revenue growth.
cash provided by operating activities was $413.6 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to $357.0 million for fiscal 2015. the increase of $56.6 million was due to an increase in net income before non-cash depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased operating income in buildings and infrastructure and resources and utilities, and also due to a decrease in working capital requirements due to inventory improvements.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $366.0 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to $144.4 million for fiscal 2016. the increase of $221.6 million used in investing activities was primarily due to increased spending for business acquisitions and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments and proceeds from sales of businesses.
cash used in investing activities was $144.4 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to $172.4 million for fiscal 2015. the decrease of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to less cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions, partially offset by the purchase of short-term investments.
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was $79.1 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to cash used of $162.3 million during fiscal 2016. the increase of cash provided by financing activities of $241.4 million was primarily driven by an increase in debt proceeds, net of repayments, partially offset by stock repurchases.
cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to cash used of $204.9 million during fiscal 2015. the decrease of cash used in financing activities of $42.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for stock repurchases, partially offset by payments on revolving credit facilities.

receivable, net, divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter, times a quarterly average of 91 days. our inventory turns were 5.2 at the end of fiscal 2017, as compared to 4.8 at the end of fiscal 2016 due to improved inventory management. our inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of sales for the most recent twelve months divided by average ending inventory, net, for this same twelve month period. to the extent that customer demand continues to increase, inventory may be purchased in advance to reduce leads times. as a result, inventory turns may decrease.
debt notes on october 30, 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") for the issuance of senior debt securities. on november 24, 2014, we issued $400.0 million of senior notes ("notes") under the shelf registration statement. the notes mature on december 1, 2024 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 of each year, beginning on june 1, 2015. the notes are classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets.
prior to september 1, 2024, we may redeem the notes at our option at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal, calculated on a semiannual basis using a discount rate equal to the u.s. treasury rate plus 40 basis points. after september 1, 2024, we may redeem the notes at our option at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. in addition, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the prospectus filed with the sec, each holder of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder's notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
in connection with the closing of the notes offering, we entered into an indenture with u.s. bank national association, as trustee. the indenture contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, each subject to certain exceptions. we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2017. the notes contain no financial covenants.
2014 credit facility on november 24, 2014, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders (the "2014 credit facility"), which replaced our previous 2012 credit facility. the 2014 credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of $1.0 billion. subject to the terms of the 2014 credit facility, the revolving loan facility may be increased and/or term loan facilities may be established in an amount up to $500.0 million. the outstanding balance of $389.0 million is classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet.
the funds available under the 2014 credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, stock repurchases and the financing of certain acquisitions. under the 2014 credit facility, we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on november 24, 2019, at which time the revolving facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. amounts not borrowed under the $1.0 billion revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee, to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter, ranging from 0.10% to 0.30% per annum depending on either our credit rating at such time or our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, whichever results in more favorable pricing to us.
we may borrow funds under the 2014 credit facility in u.s. dollars, euros or in certain other agreed currencies, and borrowings will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the administrative agent's prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) reserve-adjusted libor for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus a margin of between 0.00% and 0.75%, or (ii) a reserve-adjusted fixed per annum rate based on libor or euribor, depending on the currency borrowed, plus a margin of between 1.00% and 1.75%. the applicable margin in each case is determined based on either trimble's credit rating at such time or trimble's leverage ratio as of its most recently ended fiscal quarter, whichever results in more favorable pricing to us. interest is payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter with respect to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate, or on the last day of an interest period, but at least every three months, with respect to borrowings bearing interest at libor or euribor rate.
the 2014 credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us, which include customary use of materiality, material adverse effect and knowledge qualifiers. the 2014 credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including, among other requirements, negative covenants that restrict our ability to create liens and enter into
42
sale and leaseback transactions, and that restrict our subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness. further, the 2014 credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. specifically, we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of (a) ebitda (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) to (b) interest expense for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than 3.50 to 1.00. we must also maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of (x) total indebtedness (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) to (y) ebitda (as defined in the 2014 credit facility) for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; provided, that on the completion of a material acquisition, we may increase the ratio by 0.50 for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters. we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal 2017.
the 2014 credit facility contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and events constituting a change of control. upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the 2014 credit facility, except that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default.
in february 2016, we entered into an amendment to the 2014 credit facility to facilitate the reincorporation from california to delaware and to effect other non-financial terms. in august 2016, we entered into a second amendment to revise a definition used in determining when a change of control of the company may occur.
the interest rate on the long-term debt outstanding under the credit facilities was 2.55% and 1.80% at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
uncommitted facilities we also have two $75.0 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted (the "uncommitted facilities"). the uncommitted facilities may be called by the lenders at any time, have no covenants and no specified expiration date. the interest rate on the uncommitted facilities is 1.00% plus either libor or the bank's cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us. the $128.0 million outstanding at the end of 2017 and the $130.0 million outstanding at the end of 2016 under the uncommitted facilities are classified as short-term in our consolidated balance sheets. the weighted average interest rate on the uncommitted facilities was 2.24% at the end of fiscal 2017 and 1.65% at the end of fiscal 2016.
interim credit facility on february 2, 2018, we entered into a $300.0 million revolving credit agreement (the "2018 interim credit facility"), by and between the company and the bank of nova scotia (the "bank") in connection with the acquisition of e-builder, inc., a florida corporation. as of february 2, 2018, after giving effect to the borrowings made on the closing date, we had outstanding $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of revolving loans under this credit facility.
we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the 2018 interim credit facility until its maturity on january 31, 2019. borrowings under the 2018 interim credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) a floating per annum base rate determined by reference to the highest of: (a) the bank of nova scotia's prime rate; (b) 0.50% per annum above the federal funds effective rate; and (c) libor for an interest period of one month; plus a margin equal to 0.125%, (ii) a fixed per annum rate based on libor plus a margin of 1.125% or (iii) an interest rate agreed between us and the bank of nova scotia. the 2018 interim credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are substantially the same as those contained in the 2014 credit facility.

(1)   amount represents principal payments over the life of the debt obligations, excluding the $300.0 million 2018 interim credit facility in connection with the acquisition of e-builder, inc., which was not entered into prior to the end of fiscal 2017. (see note 7 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding debt.)
(2)   amount represents the expected interest payments relating to our debt. our $400.0 million notes accrue interest at 4.75% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on december 1 and june 1 each year. interest on our credit facilities and uncommitted facilities was estimated to be 2.55% and 2.24% per annum, respectively, based upon recent trends and is payable at least quarterly.
(3)   other purchase obligations and commitments primarily represent open non-cancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors, and also include estimated payments due for acquisition related earn-outs. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
(4)   income taxes payable represents a one-time transition tax liability related to known amounts of cash taxes payable in future years as a result of the tax act. for further information, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $76.4 million included in other non-current liabilities, including interest and penalties. at this time, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability, and therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
effect of new accounting pronouncements the impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k.
reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures. the non-gaap financial measures included in the following table as well as detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable gaap measures, are set forth below:
non-gaap gross margin we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business. non-gaap gross margin excludes restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up from gaap gross margin. we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance.
non-gaap operating expenses we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-gaap spending in relation to revenue. non-gaap operating expenses exclude restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition/divestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as
44
legal, due diligence, integration, and other required closing costs, executive transition costs, and litigation costs from gaap operating expenses. we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results.
non-gaap operating income we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending. non-gaap operating income excludes restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other required closing costs, executive transition costs, and litigation costs. we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods.
non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non-operating income trends. non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net excludes acquisition/divestiture gains/losses associated with unusual acquisition related items such as intangible asset impairment charges, gains or losses related to acquisitions, or sale of certain businesses and investments. we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results.
non-gaap income tax provision we believe that providing investors with the non-gaap income tax provision is beneficial because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our non-gaap presentation. the non-gaap income tax provision excludes material non-recurring items such as build and release of valuation allowances, reserve releases related to closure of tax audits, and other non-recurring items. we have not retroactively restated prior periods' non-gaap results with a similar separate rate. therefore, comparability between periods may be affected.
non-gaap net income this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by non-gaap income before taxes and our non-gaap tax rate. non-gaap net income excludes restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, executive transition costs, litigation costs, and non-gaap tax adjustments from gaap net income. we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance.
non-gaap diluted net income per share we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-gaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-gaap operating performance by ownership in the company. non-gaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, executive transition costs, litigation costs, and non-gaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share. we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share.
these non-gaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as our performance relative to competitors. we believe some of our investors track our "core operating performance" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results. management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons. accordingly, management excludes from non-gaap those items relating to restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, executive transition costs, litigation costs, and non-gaap tax adjustments. for detailed explanations of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures, see items (a) - ( k) below, fiscal years

(a)   restructuring charges. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, restructuring charges recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings. we exclude restructuring charges from our non-gaap measures because we believe they do not reflect expected future operating expenses, they are not indicative of our core operating performance, and they are not meaningful in comparisons to our past operating performance. we have incurred restructuring expense in each of the last three years. however the amount incurred can vary significantly based on whether a restructuring has occurred in the period and the timing of headcount reductions.
(b)   amortization of purchased intangible assets. included in our gaap presentation of gross margin and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets. u.s. gaap accounting requires that intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives. consequently, the timing and size of our acquisitions will cause our operating results to vary from period to period, making a comparison to past performance difficult for investors. this accounting treatment may cause differences when comparing our results to companies that grow internally because the fair value assigned to the intangible assets acquired through acquisition may significantly exceed the equivalent expenses that a company may incur for similar efforts when performed internally. furthermore, the useful life that we use to amortize our intangible assets over may be substantially different from the time period that an internal growth company incurs and recognizes such expenses. we believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed, it provides an alternative way for investors to compare our operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisitions and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. however, we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred, which may make a direct comparison more difficult.
(c)   stock-based compensation. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, stock-based compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan. we exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-gaap measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense. for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, stock-based compensation was allocated as follows:

total stock-based compensation expense     $64.8             $52.6             $50.1
(d)   amortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up. the purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value, which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory. included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales, the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold. we exclude inventory step-up amortization from our non-gaap measures because it is a non-cash expense that we do not believe is indicative of our ongoing operating results. we further believe that excluding this item from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
(e)   acquisition / divestiture items. included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses, acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other required closing costs, as well as adjustments to the fair value of earn-out liabilities. included in our gaap presentation of non-operating income (expense), net, acquisition/divestiture items includes unusual acquisition, investment, and/or divestiture gains/losses. although we do numerous acquisitions, the costs that have been excluded from the non-gaap measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions. these are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
(f)   executive transition costs. included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses are amounts paid to the company's former cfo upon his departure under the terms of his executive severance agreement. we excluded these payments from our non-gaap measures because they represent non-recurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses. we further believe that excluding the executive transition costs from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
(g)   litigation. these amounts represent costs accrued to settle litigation, generally as a result of an arbitration agreement. we have excluded these costs from our non-gaap measures because they are non-recurring expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. we further believe that excluding these items from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
(h)   non-gaap items tax effected. this amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-gaap items ( a ) - ( g ) on non-gaap net income. we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in this non-gaap presentation.
(i)   difference in gaap and non-gaap tax. this amount represents the difference between the gaap and non-gaap tax rates applied to the non-gaap operating income plus the non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net. we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-gaap income tax provision because it facilitates a comparison of the non-gaap tax provision in the current and prior periods. for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, this amount represents the difference between the gaap and non-gaap tax rates applied to the non-gaap operating income plus the non-gaap non-operating income (expense), net.
(j)   tax reform impacts. this amount represents the provision for income taxes recorded as a result of the tax act enacted in december 22, 2017. the provision primarily includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and related adjustments to deferred taxes and reserves, and revaluation of deferred taxes due to the reduction of u.s. income tax rate. we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. we excluded this item as it is a non-recurring expense. we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-gaap income tax provision because it allows for period-over-period comparability.
(k)   gaap and non-gaap tax rate %. these percentages are defined as gaap income tax provision as a percentage of gaap income before taxes and non-gaap income tax provision as a percentage of non-gaap income before taxes. we believe that investors benefit from a presentation of non-gaap tax rate percentage as a way of facilitating a comparison to non-gaap tax rates in prior periods.
non-gaap operating income non-gaap operating income increased by $74.8 million for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, and increased by $15.6 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. non-gaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 18.1%, 17.2%, and 17.0% for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
48
the non-gaap operating income and non-gaap operating income percentage for fiscal 2017 increased primarily attributable to revenue expansion across all segments and strong operating expense control in buildings and infrastructure, and to a lesser extent transportation, resources and utilities, and geospatial.

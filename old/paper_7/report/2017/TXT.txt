item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and consolidated results of operations during 2017, we maintained focus on investing in our businesses through continued development of new products and services. we also completed the strategic acquisition of arctic cat, a platform to expand and grow our textron specialized vehicles business.  in addition, we continued to take cost reduction actions through the execution of our restructuring plans and integration activities in order to realign our businesses, improve overall operating efficiency and better position our businesses for the future. all of these activities support our overall strategy of long-term growth and expansion of our product portfolio and the creation of long-term shareholder value.  financial highlights of 2017 include the following:
·                  generated $947 million in cash from operating activities of our manufacturing businesses, net of a $300 million discretionary contribution to fund a u.s. pension plan.
·                  invested $634 million in research and development activities, $423 million in capital expenditures and $316 million for the acquisition of arctic cat.
·                  returned $603 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
·                  continued execution of our 2016 restructuring plan and the restructuring and integration of the arctic cat acquisition, resulting in special charges of $130 million.
an analysis of our consolidated operating results is set forth below.  a more detailed analysis of our segments operating results is provided in the segment analysis section on pages 21 to 28.

revenues increased $410 million, 3%, in 2017, compared with 2016, largely driven by increases in the industrial, textron systems and bell segments, partially offset by lower revenues at the textron aviation segment.  the net revenue increase included the following factors:
·                  higher industrial revenues of $492 million, primarily due to the impact from the acquisition of arctic cat described in the segment analysis section below.
·                  higher textron systems revenues of $84 million, primarily due to higher volume of $176 million in the marine and land systems product line, partially offset by lower volume in the other products lines.
·                  higher bell revenues of $78 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial revenues of $89 million, largely reflecting higher commercial aircraft deliveries.
·                  lower textron aviation revenues of $235 million, primarily due to lower volume and mix of $307 million, largely the result of lower military and commercial turboprop volume.
revenues increased $365 million, 3%, in 2016, compared with 2015, largely driven by increases in the industrial, textron systems and textron aviation segments, partially offset by lower revenues at the bell segment.  the net revenue increase included the following factors:
·                  higher industrial revenues of $250 million, primarily due to higher volume of $168 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, and the impact from acquired businesses of $121 million.
·                  higher textron systems revenues of $236 million, primarily due to higher volume of $106 million in the marine and land systems product line and $77 million in the unmanned systems product line.
·                  higher textron aviation revenues of $99 million, primarily due to the impact from an acquired business of $66 million and higher volume and mix of $42 million, largely the result of higher citation jet volume of $165 million, partially offset by lower commercial turboprop volume.
·                  lower bell revenues of $215 million, primarily due to a decrease in commercial revenues of $269 million, largely reflecting lower commercial aircraft deliveries.

interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups with interest related to intercompany borrowings eliminated.  interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit and includes intercompany interest.  consolidated interest expense increased $5 million in 2016, compared with 2015, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding.
special charges in 2016, we initiated a plan to restructure and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall operating efficiency across textron. under this plan, textron systems discontinued production of its sensor-fuzed weapon product within its weapons and sensors operating unit, we combined our jacobsen business with the textron specialized vehicles business by consolidating facilities and general and administrative functions, and we reduced headcount at textron aviation, as well as other businesses and corporate functions.  in december 2017, we decided to take additional restructuring actions to further consolidate operating facilities and streamline product lines, primarily within the bell, textron systems and industrial segments, which resulted in additional special charges of $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. we recorded total special charges of $213 million since the inception of the 2016 plan, which included $97 million of severance costs, $84 million of asset impairments and $32 million in contract terminations and other costs.  of these amounts, $83 million was incurred at textron systems, $63 million at textron aviation, $38 million at industrial, $28 million at bell and $1 million at corporate. the total headcount reduction under this plan is expected to be approximately 2,100 positions, representing 5% of our workforce.
in connection with the acquisition of arctic cat, as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2017 to integrate this business into our textron specialized vehicles business within the industrial segment and reduce operating redundancies and maximize efficiencies.  under the arctic cat plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $28 million in 2017, which included $19 million of severance costs, largely related to change-of-control provisions, and $9 million of contract termination and other costs.  in addition, we recorded $12 million of acquisition-related integration and transaction costs in 2017.

effective tax rate        59.8%        3.8%        28.1%
in 2017, our effective tax rate was significantly higher than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, largely due to the impact from the tax cuts and jobs act (the act).  in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $266 million for one-time adjustments resulting from the act.  approximately $154 million of this provisional estimate represents a charge resulting from the remeasurement of our u.s. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the remainder represents a provision for the transition tax on post-1986 earnings and profits previously deferred from u.s. income taxes.  in addition, the act reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is expected to lower our effective tax rate for 2018 and future years.
in 2016, our effective tax rate was significantly lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, largely due to a settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service office of appeals for our 1998 to 2008 tax years.  this settlement resulted in a $206 million benefit recognized in continuing operations and a $113 million benefit in discontinued operations.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35% see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
segment analysis we operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and finance.  segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses and special charges.  the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense.
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit typically are expressed for our commercial business in terms of volume, pricing, foreign exchange and acquisitions.  additionally, changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix, inflation and cost performance. volume changes in revenues represent increases/decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided.  pricing represents changes in unit pricing.  foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period.  revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelve-month period.  for segment profit, mix represents a change due to the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins.  inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension or other costs.  performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.
21
approximately 22% of our 2017 revenues were derived from contracts with the u.s. government.  for our segments that have significant contracts with the u.s. government, we typically express changes in segment profit related to the government business in terms of volume, changes in program performance or changes in contract mix. changes in volume that are described in net sales typically drive corresponding changes in our segment profit based on the profit rate for a particular contract. changes in program performance typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. changes in contract mix refers to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes.

liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups.  the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation, bell, textron systems and industrial segments.  the finance group, which also is the finance segment, consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group.  our manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our finance group provides financial services.  due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing groups activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each groups performance.  to support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements.
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:

we believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage.  we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs, based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and other available funding alternatives, as appropriate.
textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in september 2021 for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit.  at december 30, 2017, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were $11 million of letters of credit issued against it.
we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities.  during 2017, we issued $1.0 billion of public debt under this registration statement, which consisted of $350 million in 3.65% notes due march 2027, $300 million in 3.375% notes due march 2028, and $350 million of floating rate notes due november 2020.

in 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities was $947 million, compared with $988 million in 2016, a 4% decrease, as higher pension contributions of $308 million and lower earnings were largely offset by improvements in working capital.  significant factors contributing to the favorable change in working capital included an increase in cash flows of $769 million related to changes in inventory between the periods, principally in the textron aviation and textron systems segments, $333 million related to changes in customer deposits and $179 million from changes in net taxes paid/received, partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable.  the increase in cash flows from customer deposits between the periods is primarily related to lower performance-based payments received on certain military contracts in the bell segment in 2016.
cash flows provided by operating activities was $988 million in 2016, compared with $1,038 million in 2015, a 5% decrease.  this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital, which included lower customer deposits of $257 million largely related to performance-based payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment, along with a $34 million reduction in dividends received from the finance group. these decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporate-owned life insurance policies and $42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below.
net tax (receipts)/payments were $(16) million, $163 million and $187 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. pension contributions were $358 million, $50 million and $68 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  in 2017, pension contributions included a $300 million discretionary contribution to fund a u.s. pension plan.

consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities was $980 million in 2017, compared with $1,014 million in 2016, a 3% decrease, as higher pension contributions of $308 million and lower earnings were largely offset by improvements in working capital.  significant factors contributing to the favorable change in working capital included an increase in cash flows of $764 million related to changes in inventory between the periods, principally in the textron aviation and textron systems segments, $333 million related to changes in customer deposits and $142 million of lower net tax payments, partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable.  the increase in cash flows from customer deposits between the periods is primarily related to lower performance-based payments received on certain military contracts in the bell segment in 2016.
cash flows provided by operating activities was $1,014 million in 2016, compared with $1,094 million in 2015, a 7% decrease.   this decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital, which included lower customer deposits of $257 million largely related to performance-based payments on certain military contracts in the bell segment. these decreases were partially offset by a $75 million increase in cash proceeds from the settlements of corporate-owned life insurance policies and $42 million in lower payments for taxes and pension contributions as disclosed below.
net tax payments were $32 million, $174 million and $198 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  pension contributions were $358 million, $50 million and $68 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  in 2017, pension contributions included a $300 million discretionary contribution to fund a u.s. pension plan.
investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $423 million, $446 million and $420 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  in 2017, cash flows from investing activities included a $316 million aggregate cash payment, including the repayment of debt and net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of arctic cat.  investing cash flows also included cash used for acquisitions of $186 million and $81 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
in 2017, 2016 and 2015, cash used in financing activities included the repayment of outstanding debt of $841 million, $457 million and $356 million, respectively, and share repurchases of $582 million, $241 million and $219 million, respectively, partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $1.0 billion, $525 million and $61 million, respectively.

pension and postretirement benefits we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table.  in 2018, we expect to make approximately $27 million of contributions to our funded pension plans and the retirement account plan. based on our current assumptions, which may change with changes in market conditions, our current contribution for each of the years from 2019 through 2022 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.

other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements, estimated environmental remediation costs, and a one-time transition tax, as disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, that will be paid over an eight-year period. payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on managements assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals.  the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. certain other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and product liability, warranty and litigation reserves, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.
purchase obligations purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. approximately 33% of the purchase obligations we disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies.  the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below.  we believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties.  this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which includes other significant accounting policies.
long-term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long-term contracts.  these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed-price purchase options for additional products.  we account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  under this method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract.  the percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications.  due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years.  we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, product performance, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries, technical requirements, or schedule.
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals.  we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change.  adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable.  anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.  due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.  our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns

or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.
at the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. when adjustments are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.

goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired.  the reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit.  in certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.
we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit, primarily using discounted cash flows. these cash flows incorporate assumptions for short- and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.  the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts.  the long-term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve.  we utilize a weighted-average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit.  we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.
if the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment, and no further analysis is performed.  otherwise, the amount of the impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill.  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
based on our annual impairment review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the initial step of the impairment test in the foreseeable future.

retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally.  these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations.  key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases.  we evaluate and update these assumptions annually.
to determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.  a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense.  for 2017, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.57%, compared with 7.58% in 2016.  for the last six years, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 91% of our total pension assets, was 7.75%.  a 50 basis-point decrease in this long-term rate of return in 2017 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $30 million.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled.  this rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change.  a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense.  in 2017, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 4.13%, compared with 4.66% in 2016.  for our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 4.25% in 2017, compared with 4.75% in 2016.  a 50 basis-point decrease in the weighted-average discount rate would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $37 million in 2017.
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities.  the 2017 medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits.  in 2017, we assumed a trend rate of 7.25% for both medical and prescription drug healthcare rates and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5% by 2024 and then remain at that level.  see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one-percentage-point change in the cost trend rate.

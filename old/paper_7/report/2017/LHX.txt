item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report. except for the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this md&a contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from those discussed herein. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in this md&a under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results."
the following is a list of the sections of this md&a, together with our perspective on their contents, which we hope will assist in reading these pages:
•   business considerations - a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; fiscal 2017 results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators; and industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks that are relevant to us in defense, government and commercial markets.
•   operations review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations and of the results in each of our business segments, to the extent the segment operating results are helpful to an understanding of our business as a whole, for the three years presented in our financial statements.
•   liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies - an analysis of cash flows, funding of pension plans, common stock repurchases, dividends, capital structure and resources, contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, commercial commitments, financial risk management, impact of foreign exchange and impact of inflation.
•   critical accounting policies and estimates - a discussion of accounting policies and estimates that require the most judgment and a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented by us and their potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•   forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results - cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections.
business considerations general we generate revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing or providing, and selling advanced, technology-based solutions that solve government and commercial customers' mission-critical challenges. we support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the u.s. government and their prime contractors. our products, systems and services have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. as of the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately 17,000 employees, including approximately 7,700 engineers and scientists. we generally sell directly to our customers, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.
we structure our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the financial results of our continuing operations in the following three reportable segments, which are also referred to as our business segments:
•   communication systems, serving markets in tactical communications and defense products, including tactical ground and airborne radio communications solutions and night vision technology, and in public safety networks;
•   electronic systems, providing electronic warfare, avionics and c4isr solutions for the defense industry and atm solutions for the civil aviation industry; and
•   space and intelligence systems, providing intelligence, space protection, geospatial, complete earth observation, universe exploration, pnt, and environmental solutions for national security, defense, civil and commercial customers, using advanced sensors, antennas and payloads, as well as ground processing and information analytics.
as described above and in more detail in note 1: significant accounting policies under "principles of consolidation" and in note 3: discontinued operations and divestitures in the notes, we completed the divestiture of caprock in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the divestiture of it services in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. caprock
34
and it services were part of our former critical networks segment and are reported as discontinued operations in this report. our historical financial results have been restated for all periods presented in this report to account for businesses reported as discontinued operations in this report. except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this report relate solely to our continuing operations.
in connection with entering into the definitive agreement to sell it services, our other remaining operations that had been part of our former critical networks segment, including our atm business and our pmrf program, were integrated with our electronic systems segment effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and our critical networks segment was eliminated. the historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this report reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present all segment information on a comparable basis. there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows resulting from these segment changes.
financial information with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to our business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as part of the "engineering, selling and administrative expenses," "non-operating income (loss)," "interest income," "interest expense" or "discontinued operations, net of income taxes" line items in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
value drivers of our business fiscal 2017 represented a critical inflection point for us. we entered the year undergoing a multi-year transformation to reposition the company and deliver against our strategic priorities. through disciplined execution, we were able to capture annual run-rate savings from the exelis acquisition a full year ahead of schedule, while driving operational efficiencies and optimizing our portfolio to focus on businesses where technology is a differentiator. we completed the it services and caprock divestitures during the fiscal year and used the proceeds along with our net cash provided by operating activities to repurchase shares of our common stock, pay down debt and make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans. in fiscal 2018, we intend to focus on continuing to create long-term, sustainable shareholder value by building on the positive momentum from our solid fiscal 2017 performance that included delivering against all of our strategic priorities. we expect the combination of our strong competitive position, differentiated technologies that address our customers' most critical challenges and excellent operational execution to drive top-line growth and higher earnings in the medium-term.
our strategic focus includes:
•   growing revenue across all three business segments;
•   driving flawless execution while maintaining margins through operational excellence; and
•   maximizing cash flow with balanced capital deployment while continuing to invest for the future.
as we have seen in the government fiscal year ("gfy") 2017 omnibus appropriations bill, as well as the president's 2018 budget request and congressional markups, the u.s. government funding outlook is improving, and our programs are expected to be largely well-supported, especially within the dod for our tactical communications business, electronic systems and in intelligence community budgets. an important part of our strategy is to grow revenue across the business in fiscal 2018 and beyond, and we expect all segments will contribute to this growth. for communication systems, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of dod modernizations towards the second half of fiscal 2018 as we start to deliver next-generation tactical radios with new features and capabilities to the u.s. special operations forces and the u.s. army, and we believe this will continue into fiscal 2019 and beyond. our international tactical business began to stabilize in the second half of fiscal 2017, and we expect to return to growth in the medium-term as the middle east comes out of a trough and australia and u.k. modernizations get underway. in electronic systems, we expect to see growth across the board. our electronic warfare business has a solid and growing pipeline of opportunities on the f-35, f-16 and f-18 platforms, as well as for the b-52 and c-130j platforms. for space and intelligence systems, we expect to see continued strong growth in the classified area, driven by budget increases and expansion into new adjacencies. we also expect increasing momentum in commercial space from recapitalizations.
our operational excellence program, harris business excellence ("hbx"), is focused on streamlining processes, optimizing program execution, and increasing customer satisfaction. hbx incorporates standardized, industry-proven processes and tools based on the principles of lean six sigma. since implementation, we have made significant strides in customer satisfaction, productivity and asset velocity through our efforts to optimize processes, eliminate waste, reduce costs and enhance quality across multiple aspects of our business. one method we use to drive continuous improvement is "value engineering" - continuously evaluating new materials, processes and technologies to insert into products already in production, helping to reduce costs and improve both quality and customer satisfaction.
innovation is at the core of our success, and r&d investment represents the foundation for innovation. our r&d investments are focused on leveraging our existing technology portfolio to introduce new solutions or expand customer-centric features and functions on existing solutions. innovation also leads to natural extensions of our core capabilities for
35
capturing new opportunities in adjacent markets. innovation provides differentiation and is a key competitive advantage for our business.
we have adopted a portfolio management approach designed to optimize investment in r&d at the company level rather than the business unit level. this approach is intended to ensure our r&d investment is cost-effective, supports innovation across the entire company and maximizes efficiency while maintaining our technological edge. we introduced standardized processes and common metrics to track progress and gauge success, and established core technology centers to more fully leverage r&d investment across our company.
during fiscal 2017, we thoughtfully deployed proceeds from divestitures and net cash provided by operating activities. we returned $710 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and another $262 million in dividends. we also used $499 million for net repayment of borrowings (including retiring $575 million of debt) and $400 million for a voluntary contribution to our u.s. defined benefit plans which helped reduce our unfunded defined benefit plans liability by 44 percent to $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. in fiscal 2018, we expect to improve our operating cash flow and to use our capital to achieve our debt repayment commitment, as well as for share repurchases and dividends.
key indicators we believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: revenue; income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common share; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital; return on average equity; and consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio. the measure of our success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.
fiscal 2017 results of operations key indicators:    revenue, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common share and income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•   revenue decreased 2 percent to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2017 from $6.0 billion in fiscal 2016;
•   income from continuing operations increased 4 percent to $638 million in fiscal 2017 from $611 million in fiscal 2016;
•   income from continuing operations per diluted common share increased 5 percent to $5.12 in fiscal 2017 from $4.87 in fiscal 2016, reflecting both the increase in income from continuing operations as noted above and fewer diluted common shares outstanding due to repurchases of shares of common stock under our repurchase program during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017; and
•   income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased to 11 percent in fiscal 2017 from 10 percent in fiscal 2016.
refer to md&a heading "operations review" below in this report for more information.
liquidity and capital resources key indicators:     net cash provided by operating activities, return on invested capital, return on average equity and our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio also represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•   net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $569 million in fiscal 2017 from $924 million in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a $400 million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017;
•   return on invested capital (defined as after-tax operating income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of invested capital at the beginning and end of the fiscal year, where invested capital equals equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents) increased to 11 percent in fiscal 2017 from 10 percent in fiscal 2016;
•   return on average equity (defined as income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the beginning and end of the fiscal year) increased to 21 percent in fiscal 2017 from 19 percent in fiscal 2016;
•   our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio at june 30, 2017 was 58 percent, compared to our 65 percent covenant limitation under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility;
•   our cash used for net repayment of borrowings decreased to $499 million (including retiring $575 million of debt) in fiscal 2017 from $669 million in fiscal 2016; and
•   our unfunded defined benefit plans liability decreased $1.0 billion in fiscal 2017 to $1.3 billion at june 30, 2017 compared to $2.3 billion at july 1, 2016.

industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks department of defense and other u.s. federal markets:    our largest customers are various departments and agencies of the u.s. government - the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 74 percent, 77 percent and 66 percent, respectively. the gfy 2017 (u.s. government fiscal years begin october 1 and end september 30) budget cycle ended with the omnibus appropriations bill being passed by congress and signed by president trump on may 5, 2017. our programs were fully funded and continue to remain priorities for u.s. government customers. in addition, president trump's gfy 2018 budget request fully funded all of our major programs in both the dod and civil agencies. specifically, the gfy 2018 budget request included $574 billion in dod base funding with an additional $65 billion in overseas contingency operations ("oco") funding. the dod budget request increases funding across all of the services, including socom, from the 2017 gfy continuing resolution ("cr") levels and provides a 19.2 percent increase in r&d funding and a 4.6 percent increase in procurement funding from 2017 gfy cr levels. the budget request funds the dod with $52 billion over the limits mandated in the budget control act of 2011 ("bca"), which established limits on discretionary spending and reduced planned defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period beginning with gfy 2012. in addition, the bca provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, that went into effect march 1, 2013, that would have resulted in an additional $500 billion reduction to planned defense spending over a nine-year period beginning with gfy 2013.
in november 2015, president obama signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ("bba 2015"), which raised the limit on the u.s. government's debt through march 2017 and increased the sequester caps on discretionary spending imposed by the bca by $80 billion over gfy 2016 - 2017, providing more certainty in the near-term budget planning process. however, budget caps for gfys 2018 through 2022 remain intact after the enactment of bba 2015 as does the across-the-board spending reduction methodology provided under the bca.
we anticipate debate and negotiations will continue within the u.s. government over defense spending for gfy 2018 and beyond, which may have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and on our specific programs. however, as described in further detail in the "value drivers of our business" section of this md&a, our programs have been well supported in both the gfy 2017 omnibus appropriations bill as well as the president's gfy 2018 budget request.
government oversight and risk:    as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to u.s. government oversight. the u.s. government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the u.s. government could make claims against us. under u.s. government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new u.s. government contracts for a period of time determined by the u.s. government. similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
for a discussion of risks relating to u.s. government contracts and subcontracts, see "item 1. business - principal customers; government contracts" and "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. we are also subject to other risks associated with u.s. government business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 3. legal proceedings" of this report.
state and local:    we also provide products to state and local government agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. the public safety market was highly competitive and dependent on state and local government budgets during fiscal 2017. future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation lte solutions for high data-rate applications, an emerging market in the early stages of development.
international:   we believe there is continuing international demand from military and government customers for tactical radios, public safety communications, electronic warfare equipment, air traffic management, electronic attack and release systems and isr. we believe we can leverage our domain expertise and proven technology provided in the u.s. to further expand our international business.
we believe that our experience, technologies and capabilities are well aligned with the demand and requirements of the markets noted above in this report. however, we remain subject to the spending levels, pace and priorities of the u.s. government as well as international governments and commercial customers, and to general economic conditions that could adversely affect us, our customers and our suppliers. we also remain subject to other risks associated with these markets, including technological uncertainties, adoption of our new products and other risks that are discussed below in this report under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results" and in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report.

* not meaningful revenue fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the decrease in revenue in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower tactical communications revenue in our communication systems segment and lower revenue due to the impact of the divestiture of our aerostructures business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which contributed $60 million of revenue in fiscal 2016 in our electronic systems segment, and the impact of certain environmental and commercial space programs in our space and intelligence systems segment transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase, partially offset by higher revenue from the ramp up of the united arab emirates integrated battle management system (bms-elts) program and from electronic warfare in our electronic systems segment and by $36 million of higher revenue from classified customers in our space and intelligence systems segment.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in revenue in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of revenue from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness in our communication systems segment related to dod and international tactical radio markets.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.

gross margin percentage fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    gross margin as a percentage of revenue ("gross margin percentage") in fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016 reflecting cost containment and integration-related synergy savings and higher pension income, mostly offset by lower margins from the ads-b program as it transitions from a build-out to a sustainment phase and the margin impact of lower revenue in our communication systems segment.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of contract types, toward an increased percentage of lower-margin cost-plus contracts. additionally, gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 reflected a lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines and write-downs, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, of certain assets related to restructuring programs.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
engineering, selling and administrative expenses fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the decrease in engineering, selling and administrative ("esa") expenses in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cost containment, integration-related synergy savings and a $63 million reduction in integration and other costs associated with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by the benefit in fiscal 2016 of $101 million net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. esa expenses as a percentage of revenue ("esa percentage") in fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $310 million in fiscal 2017 compared with $305 million in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in esa expenses in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of esa expenses from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $109 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired, $121 million of integration and other costs associated with the acquisition (including $11 million for amortization of a step-up in inventory) and $33 million of charges, recorded in fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items. these drivers of the increase in esa expenses were partially offset by a net liability reduction of $101 million, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, for certain post-employment benefit plans. the decrease in esa percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefits described in the preceding sentence, lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis, partially offset by the amortization, integration and other costs and charges for restructuring noted in this paragraph.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $305 million in fiscal 2016 compared with $276 million in fiscal 2015.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
non-operating income (loss)
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    non-operating income in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an adjustment to the net gain on the sale of aerostructures. non-operating income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $10 million net gain on the divestiture of aerostructures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    non-operating income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the same reasons as noted above for fiscal 2016 non-operating income. non-operating loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $118 million of charges associated with our optional redemption on may 27, 2015 of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due december 1, 2017 and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019, including a total of $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to these notes that were written off in connection with our redemption of the notes. these charges were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $9 million related to our divestiture of hcs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
see note 21: non-operating income (loss) in the notes for further information.
net interest expense fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    our net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of $499 million of net repayment of borrowings, which included $313 million of repayment of our variable-rate term loans and our repayment of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016.
39
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    our net interest expense increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of our issuance of $2.4 billion of debt securities and our borrowing of $1.3 billion under a term loan agreement to finance our acquisition of exelis in fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
see note 18: interest expense in the notes for further information.
income taxes fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    in fiscal 2017, our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes) benefited from the net favorable impact of:
•   the adoption of the accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") that changed the accounting for certain aspects of stock options and other share-based compensation and resulted in a $23 million income tax benefit, as discussed in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes;
•   several differences between gaap and tax accounting related to investments; and
•   additional deductions and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2016 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate benefited from:
•   settlement of several items for amounts that were lower than previously recorded estimates;
•   legislation enacted in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 that restored the u.s. federal income tax credit for qualifying r&amp;d expenses for calendar year 2015 and made the credit permanent for the periods following december 31, 2015;
•   recognition of a tax loss, net of valuation allowances, upon the divestiture of aerostructures;
•   state tax reductions resulting from our integration of exelis operations; and
•   several differences between gaap and tax accounting related to investments.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the major discrete items from which our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited are those noted for fiscal 2016 in the preceding discussion under "income taxes." in fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from foreign tax credits resulting from a dividend paid by a foreign subsidiary, finalizing issues with various foreign and domestic tax authorities for amounts lower than estimates previously recorded, additional deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2014 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2014. these benefits were partially offset in the fourth quarter by the tax cost of repatriating offshore funds, the impact of non-deductible goodwill in our divestiture of hcs and the non-deductibility of some acquisition-related costs.
see note 23: income taxes in the notes for further information.
income from continuing operations fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016: the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this "consolidated results of operations" discussion regarding fiscal 2017 and 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this "consolidated results of operations" discussion regarding fiscal 2016 and 2015.
income from continuing operations per diluted common share fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 and fewer diluted weighted average common shares outstanding due to significant levels of repurchases of shares of common stock under our repurchase program during fiscal 2017.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, partially offset by greater diluted weighted average common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition of exelis.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    segment revenue in fiscal 2017 included tactical communications revenue of $1,341 million, a 6 percent decrease from $1,429 million in fiscal 2016; and public safety and professional communications revenue of $412 million, a 5 percent decrease from $435 million in fiscal 2016. the decrease in tactical communications revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $85 million lower revenue from legacy exelis tactical radios and night vision products. the decrease in public safety and professional communications revenue was primarily due to the wind-down of a significant international network project.
the decrease in segment gross margin in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower restructuring charges. segment gross margin percentage decreased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016, despite 6 percent lower revenue and a less favorable revenue mix, primarily due to cost containment and exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings. the decreases in segment esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to cost containment, lower restructuring costs and exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings. the slight increase in segment operating income and the increase in segment operating income as a percentage of revenue ("operating margin percentage") in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 2 percentage points in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite the impact of 6 percent lower revenue over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 42 percent in fiscal 2017 and 52 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally ground and airborne tactical radio and night vision operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness related to dod and international tactical radio markets. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a less favorable mix among products and programs, $14 million of restructuring and other charges and lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines. segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 was slightly higher compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to $6 million of charges, recorded during fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items, mostly offset by lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis. the decreases in segment operating income and segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher revenue from the ramp up of the united arab emirates integrated battle management system (bms-elts) program and from electronic warfare solutions, partially offset by $60 million of lower revenue attributable to the divestiture of aerostructures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and $41 million of lower revenue from the impact of the ads-b program transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase.
the increases in segment gross margin and gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to continued strong program performance principally in the electronic warfare solutions business and higher pension income, partially offset by a $21 million unfavorable margin impact from the ads-b program as it transitions from a build-out to a sustainment phase. the decrease in segment esa expenses in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings and $8 million of charges for restructuring and other costs recorded in fiscal 2016, partially offset by $13 million of higher r&d expenses. segment esa percentage for fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016. the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 2 percentage points in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite revenue increasing only 1 percent over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 82 percent in fiscal 2017 and 83 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally integrated electronic warfare systems; radar, reconnaissance and undersea systems; electronic attack and release systems; specialty applications; composites operations; and atm solutions for the aviation industry) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from faa nextgen modernization programs, electronic warfare and counter-ied systems, partially offset by lower revenue from commercial broadband satellite program terminals. the increase in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to a more favorable mix of programs. the segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 was slightly lower compared with fiscal 2015 as $8 million of charges for restructuring and other costs recorded in fiscal 2016 were partially offset by cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis. the increase in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    segment revenue in fiscal 2017 increased slightly compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to $36 million of higher revenue from classified customers, mostly offset by lower revenue from the impact of certain environmental and commercial space programs transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase.
the increases in segment gross margin and gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily attributable to improved program performance and higher pension income, partially offset by a $30 million impact due to lower revenue from relatively higher-margin environmental and commercial space programs. the increases in segment esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to higher r&d and proposal expenses. the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite slight revenue growth over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 95 percent in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally geospatial intelligence solutions; integrated sensing and information systems; environmental intelligence; precision instruments and pnt; and command, control and communication systems operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from new classified programs, including programs in space superiority and protection, partially offset by the completion of several other classified programs. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to a less favorable mix of cost-plus intelligence and space payload programs, as well as the retirement of risk on certain space programs in fiscal 2015. the decrease in segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower esa percentage from exelis businesses. the increase in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.

in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by a $63 million decrease in exelis acquisition-related and other charges. because the exelis acquisition benefited our entire company as opposed to any individual segment, we recorded the acquired intangible assets as corporate assets and the related amortization expense as unallocated corporate expense.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the decrease in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net liability reduction of $101 million for certain post-employment benefit plans, a $14 million decrease in acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of exelis, including transaction, integration, restructuring and other costs, and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis.

cash and cash equivalents:    the $3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $710 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $584 million used to repay borrowings (which included $313 million of repayment of our variable-rate term loans and our repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016), $262 million used to pay cash dividends and $119 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment, mostly offset by $1,014 million of net proceeds from sales of businesses, $569 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $85 million of proceeds from borrowings and $54 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options. the $6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $924 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $181 million of net proceeds from the sale of businesses, $61 million of proceeds from borrowings and $44 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, mostly offset by $730 million used to repay borrowings, $252 million used to pay cash dividends and $152 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment.
we ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $484 million, and we have a senior unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility that expires in july 2020 ($925 million of which was available to us as of june 30, 2017 as a result of $75 million of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper program). additionally, we had $3.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding at june 30, 2017, the majority of which we incurred in connection with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. for further information regarding our long-term debt, see note 13: long-term debt in the notes. our $484 million of cash and cash equivalents at june 30, 2017 included $171 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $132 million is considered permanently reinvested. of the $132 million, $96 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes. we would be required to recognize u.s. income taxes of $11 million on the remaining $36 million if we were to repatriate such funds to the u.s., but we have no current plans to repatriate such funds.
given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our current level of debt, u.s. government budget uncertainties and the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.
we also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and repayments of our term loans and debt securities at maturity for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $130 million. we anticipate tax payments in fiscal 2018 to be approximately equal to or marginally less than our tax expense for the same period, subject to adjustment for certain timing differences. for additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 23: income taxes in the notes. other than those cash outlays noted in the "contractual obligations" discussion below in this md&a, capital
44
expenditures, dividend payments, payments under our term loans and repurchases of common stock, no other significant cash outlays are anticipated in fiscal 2018.
there can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital markets disruptions. if we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and other markets we serve and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.
net cash provided by operating activities:    the $355 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $415 million more in qualified pension plan contributions, including a $400 million voluntary contribution, and $127 million less of impairment of goodwill and other assets, partially offset by $229 million more in net income. cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities:    the $871 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $833 million more in net proceeds from sales of businesses (consisting of $646 million of net proceeds from the sale of it services and $370 million of net proceeds from the sale of caprock in fiscal 2017, compared with $181 million in net proceeds from the sale of aerostructures in fiscal 2016), as well as $33 million less used for net additions of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software. the $3.3 billion decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.2 billion in net cash used to acquire exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:    the $545 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $710 million more cash used to repurchase our common stock and $10 million more cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by $170 million less cash used for net repayment of borrowings (reflecting $499 million of cash used for net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2017 compared with $669 million of cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2016).
the $3.3 billion increase in net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.6 billion less proceeds from borrowings (primarily reflecting the debt issued in connection of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015) and $54 million more net cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by: (i) $224 million less net cash used to repay borrowings (reflecting $730 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2016 compared with $954 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2015 including the redemption of two series of our notes), (ii) $150 million less net cash used to repurchase our common stock, and (iii) $39 million less net cash used in other financing activities.
funding of pension plans funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our u.s. pension plans. although we have significant discretion in making voluntary contributions, the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 and further amended by the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ("map-21") and applicable internal revenue code regulations mandate minimum funding thresholds. failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments. with respect to our u.s. qualified pension plans, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds.
the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 ("hatfa") and bba 2015 further extended the interest rate stabilization provision of map-21 until 2020. we made a $400 million voluntary contribution to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2017. as a result, we currently do not anticipate making any contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018.
future required contributions will depend primarily on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory minimum contributions could be material. we have net unfunded defined benefit plan obligations of approximately $1.3 billion as of june 30, 2017 compared with approximately $2.3 billion as of july 1, 2016. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.

common stock repurchases during fiscal 2017, we used $710 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under our 2013 repurchase program and our 2017 repurchase program, including (i) $600 million pursuant to asr agreements, as described below; (ii) approximately $100 million to repurchase 1,100,203 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price per share of $90.45, including commissions; and (iii) approximately $11 million to repurchase 101,030 shares of our common stock from our rabbi trust, which is associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, at an average price per share of $110.34. during fiscal 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our repurchase program. in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, $21 million and $16 million, respectively, in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.
on february 6, 2017, we entered into the february asr - a fixed-dollar asr transaction to repurchase an unspecified total number of shares of our common stock for $350 million - and on may 5, 2017, we entered into the may asr - a fixed-dollar asr transaction to repurchase an unspecified total number of shares of our common stock for $250 million. pursuant to each of these asr transactions, the counterparty delivers to us shares of our common stock during the term of the transaction in exchange for an up-front fixed dollar payment. the specific total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the transaction based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount. shares delivered pursuant to asr transactions are retired in the period of delivery, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to the "other capital" and "retained earnings" line items in our consolidated balance sheet in the period the payment is made.
the following table summarizes our asr transactions in fiscal 2017:

(1) pursuant to the may asr, on may 5, 2017, we paid $250 million and received an initial delivery of 1,931,818 shares of our common stock based on a price of $110.00 per share, representing approximately 85 percent of the total number of shares of our common stock we expect to repurchase under the may asr. the specific total number of shares we ultimately repurchase under the may asr will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount, and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the may asr. upon settlement of the may asr (expected no later than the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018), we may receive additional shares of our common stock from the counterparty or, under certain limited circumstances, be required to deliver shares of our common stock to the counterparty.
on january 26, 2017, our board of directors approved our 2017 repurchase program - a new $1 billion share repurchase program that does not have a stated expiration date and is in addition to our 2013 repurchase program - a $1 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on august 23, 2013 that also did not have a stated expiration date. our repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 used the entire remaining authorization under our 2013 repurchase program (approximately $233 million) and a portion of the authorization under our 2017 repurchase program, and consequently, we will not make further repurchases under our 2013 repurchase program. as of june 30, 2017, we had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately $973 million under our 2017 repurchase program. repurchases under our repurchase program are expected to be funded with available cash and commercial paper and may be made through open market purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. the level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. the timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. additional information regarding our repurchase programs is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
dividends on august 25, 2017, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.53 per share to $.57 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $2.28 per share, which was our sixteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. our annualized cash dividend rate in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.12 per share, $2.00 per share and $1.88 per share, respectively. there can be no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will continue to increase. quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in march, june, september and december. we currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends. the declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will

depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
capital structure and resources
2015 credit agreement:    as discussed in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes, on july 1, 2015, we established a new $1 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2015 credit facility") by entering into a revolving credit agreement (the "2015 credit agreement") with a syndicate of lenders. the 2015 credit facility replaced our prior $1 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. the description of the 2015 credit facility and the 2015 credit agreement set forth in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes is incorporated herein by reference.
short-term debt:     our short-term debt at june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 was $80 million and $15 million, respectively. our short-term debt at july 1, 2016 consisted of local borrowings by international subsidiaries for working capital needs. during fiscal 2017, our short-term debt increased to a fiscal quarter-end high of $233 million as of march 31, 2017, primarily due to commercial paper issued to partially fund repayment of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we used net proceeds from the caprock and it services divestitures to repay commercial paper, and as of june 30, 2017, our short-term debt consisted of $75 million under our commercial paper program and $5 million of local borrowings of international subsidiaries. our commercial paper program was supported at june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 by the 2015 credit facility.
long-term variable-rate debt:    the description of the term loan agreement set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 29, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our term loan agreement, comprised of two tranches:
•   $650 million in a 3-year tranche due may 29, 2018, and
•   $650 million in a 5-year tranche due may 29, 2020.
as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, we repaid $313 million and $650 million of the principal amount of our variable-rate term loans during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
long-term fixed-rate debt:    the description of our long-term fixed-rate debt set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 27, 2015, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due december 1, 2017 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $448 million and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $415 million. the notes were terminated and cancelled.
as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on april 27, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, and to fund our optional redemption of our two series of notes described above, we issued debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion, comprised of several tranches with principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates as follows:
•   $500 million of 1.999% notes due april 27, 2018,
•   $400 million of 2.700% notes due april 27, 2020,
•   $600 million of 3.832% notes due april 27, 2025,

(1) the purchase obligations of $1.0 billion included $166 million of purchase obligations related to cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.
(2) amount includes fiscal 2018 minimum contributions to a non-u.s. pension plan. contributions beyond fiscal 2018 have not been determined. during fiscal 2017, we made a voluntary contribution of $400 million to our u.s. qualified pension plans, and as a result, we currently do not anticipate making any contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018.
(3) the above table does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $90 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•   any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;
•   a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
•   any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain derivative instruments; and
•   any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the registrant, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or r&amp;d services with the registrant.
as of june 30, 2017, we were not participating in any material transactions that generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we did not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. as of june 30, 2017, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and we were not a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. we do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. if any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. we believe that the financial risk of default by such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

commercial commitments we have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. at june 30, 2017, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:

the surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to public safety and professional communications. as is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance, warranty and other purposes (collectively, "performance bonds"). such performance bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a performance bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project contract. in such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the performance bond for the amounts paid. it has been rare for our public safety and professional communications business to have a performance bond drawn upon. in addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure performance bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below "investment grade," we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of performance bonds. such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of performance bonds and could make it more difficult to procure performance bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. such collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. in addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain performance bonds and may result in higher funding costs.
financial risk management in the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
foreign exchange and currency:    we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments. factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets (particularly with respect to the united kingdom due to brexit) and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. a 10 percent change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
interest rates:    as of june 30, 2017, we had long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. the fair value of these obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of these obligations. additionally, there is no interest-rate risk associated with these obligations on our results of operations and cash flows,
49
because the interest rates are fixed, and because our long-term fixed-rate debt is not putable to us (i.e., not required to be redeemed by us prior to maturity). we can give no assurances, however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations over the next twelve months.
as of june 30, 2017, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $305 million under our senior unsecured term loan facility in connection with our acquisition of exelis, comprised of term loans of $36 million in a 3-year tranche due may 29, 2018 and $269 million in a 5-year tranche due may 29, 2020. these term loans bear interest that is variable based on certain short-term indices, thus exposing us to interest-rate risk; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for these term loans at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. we have the ability at any time or from time to time, to voluntarily prepay term loans of either tranche in whole or in part without premium or penalty. as a result of our prepayments, we have effectively prepaid all mandatory quarterly principal amortization payments and are no longer required to make such payments for the remaining term until maturity on each tranche of the term loans. see note 13: long-term debt in the notes for further information.
as of june 30, 2017, we also had short-term variable-rate debt outstanding, primarily under our commercial paper program, subject to interest rate risk. we utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. the interest rate risk associated with such debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material due to its temporary nature.
impact of foreign exchange approximately 20 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2017 compared with 16 percent in fiscal 2016. the impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to u.s. dollars is included as a component of shareholders' equity. as of june 30, 2017, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity was a $113 million loss compared with a $131 million loss at july 1, 2016. we utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions. gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
impact of inflation to the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin, revenue or operating income in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes. in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the notes. we consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this md&a where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of our board of directors. preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed "critical," affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem "critical."
50
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. revenue and profits related to development and production contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion (i.e., the "cost-to-cost" method) or the ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered under the contract (i.e., the "units-of-delivery" method) with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated profit. the majority of the revenue in our space and intelligence systems and electronic systems segments (and to a certain extent, revenue in our communication systems segment) relates to development and production contracts, and the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition is primarily used for these contracts. change orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a development and production contract are included in contract value only when the value can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. possible incentives or penalties and award fees applicable to performance on development and production contracts are considered in estimating contract value and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. incentive provisions that increase earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. we are party to certain contracts with incentive provisions or award fees that are subject to uncertainty until the conclusion of the contract, and our customers may be entitled to reclaim and receive previous award fee payments.
under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each development and production contract over its period of performance. recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress toward completion. the estimated profit or loss on a development and production contract is equal to the difference between the estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. due to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires judgment. factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance, the risk and impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims outside the original development and production contract included in the estimate to complete. at the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. after establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard estimate at completion process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing development and production contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. if we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. additionally, at the outset of a cost-reimbursable contract (for example, contracts containing award or incentive fees), we establish an estimate of total contract value, or revenue, based on our expectation of performance on the contract. as the cost-reimbursable contract progresses, our estimates of total contract value may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive higher or lower than expected award fees. when adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total contract value are determined, the related impact to operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. anticipated losses on development and production contracts or programs in progress are charged to operating income when identified. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to estimate our costs related to development and production contracts in the past three fiscal years.
estimate at completion adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented:
2017                                             2016              2015
(in millions)
favorable adjustments                 $118              $187              $114
unfavorable adjustments               (104   )          (119   )           (60   )
net operating income adjustments       $14               $68               $54
there were no individual impacts to operating income due to estimate at completion adjustments in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.
we also recognize revenue from arrangements requiring the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale. in these arrangements, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and the timing of revenue recognition for each deliverable. if we determine that individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we recognize the revenue associated with each unit of accounting separately, and contract revenue is allocated among the separate units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on relative selling price. if
51
options or change orders materially change the scope of work or price of the contract subsequent to inception, we reevaluate and adjust our prior conclusions regarding units of accounting and allocation of contract revenue as necessary. the allocation of selling price among the separate units of accounting may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. we establish the selling price used for each deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, or third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price if vsoe of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price is available. in determining vsoe of selling price, a substantial majority of the recent standalone sales of the deliverable must be priced within a relatively narrow range. in determining tpe of selling price, we evaluate competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. generally, comparable pricing of our products to those of our competitors with similar functionality cannot be obtained. in determining besp, we consider both market data and entity-specific factors, including market conditions, the geographies in which our products are sold, our competitive position and strategy, and our profit objectives.
the fasb has issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap and will be effective for us in fiscal 2019. see note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes for additional information.
postretirement benefit plans former exelis employees participate in numerous defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as "defined benefit plans") in the united states, which are sponsored by harris. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors (some of which are disclosed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes). actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy or, if applicable, the future working lifetime of the plan's active participants. in fiscal 2017, we adopted updated mortality tables, which resulted in a decrease in the defined benefit plans' projected benefit obligation as of june 30, 2017 and estimated net periodic benefit cost beginning fiscal 2018.
significant assumptions we develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.
obligation assumptions as of:              june 30, 2017        july 1, 2016
discount rate                                      3.76%               3.62%
rate of future compensation increase               2.76%               2.75%
cost assumptions for fiscal years:                  2017   2016
discount rate to determine service cost            3.80%               4.06%
discount rate to determine interest cost           2.94%               4.06%
expected return on plan assets                     7.65%               7.91%
rate of future compensation increase               2.75%               2.76%
key assumptions for the u.s. salaried retirement plan ("u.s. srp") (our largest defined benefit plan with approximately 90% of the total projected benefit obligation) included a discount rate for obligation assumptions of 3.78% and expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for fiscal 2017, which is being maintained at 7.75% for fiscal 2018. effective december 31, 2016, accruals under the u.s. srp benefit formula were frozen for all employees and replaced with a 1% cash balance benefit formula for certain non-highly compensated employees.
expected return on plan assets substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust. we determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets over the past 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes. future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class
52
returns. based on this approach, the long-term annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.65% and 7.91% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics.
in fiscal 2017, we changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost of the u.s. defined benefit plans. the new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. prior to fiscal 2017, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.
we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. we accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. although the benefit obligation measured under this approach was unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates reduced the fiscal 2017 service and interest costs for the u.s. defined benefit plans by approximately $46 million as a result of this change.
in tandem with our change to the alternative spot rate approach to estimate service cost and interest cost for fiscal 2017 expense, we changed, as of july 1, 2016, the underlying yield curve from a published median yield curve to our actuaries' above median yield curve to improve our ability to make such estimates. we believe we will be better able to explain changes of individual spot rates between periods with details from our actuaries supporting the underlying yield curve. if we had continued to use a median yield curve, our projected benefit obligation would have been approximately $339 million, or 5 percent, higher as of july 1, 2016.
sensitivity analysis pension expense a 25 basis point change in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans' fiscal 2018 pension expense:
increase/(decrease)
in pension expense
25 basis                  25 basis point increase            point decrease
(in millions)
long-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost   $(11.8        )           $11.8
discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost                        $8.1                      $(8.6         )
projected benefit obligation funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ("pbo") from the fair value of plan assets. the sensitivity of the pbo to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. we estimate that a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate of the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans would increase the pbo by approximately $167 million and an increase of 25 basis points would decrease the pbo by approximately $159 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and international equity securities, fixed income investments, interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. consequently, we have estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset

managers, as well as general market information. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information.
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. we balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer requirements. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. the review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our business segments. several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product line, technological change and new product development. these factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. in the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in the "cost of product sales" line item in our consolidated statement of income at the time of such determination. in the case of goods that have been written down below cost, such reduced amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. we have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.
as of june 30, 2017, our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $52 million, or 12 percent of our gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of $51 million, or 11 percent of our gross inventory balance, as of july 1, 2016. we recorded $6 million, $29 million and $2 million in inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations before income taxes during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, including the impact of planned future product launches, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.
goodwill goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 was $5,366 million and $5,352 million, respectively. goodwill is not amortized. we perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount, including goodwill, which is adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
it services goodwill allocation and impairment as described in more detail in note 3: discontinued operations and divestitures in the notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell it services on january 26, 2017 and completed the sale on april 28, 2017.
because the then-pending divestiture of it services represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our former critical networks segment, we assigned $487 million of goodwill to the it services disposal group on a relative fair value basis during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, when the held for sale criteria were met. the fair value of the it services disposal group was determined based on the negotiated selling price, and the fair value of the retained businesses (which comprised the remaining portion of the reporting unit) was determined based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. these fair value determinations are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.
in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses for impairment. as a result, we concluded, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that goodwill and other assets related to it services were impaired as of march 31, 2017, and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $240 million in discontinued operations, $228 million of which related to goodwill. the goodwill impairment charge is non-deductible for tax purposes.

fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 impairment tests we estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months' sales and earnings of our reporting units. projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. the sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. we then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable. we have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, we performed our annual impairment tests of our reporting units' goodwill. we completed these tests with no adjustment required to the goodwill of any of our reporting units. as of the date of our fiscal 2017 impairment test, the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. however, the fair value of one of the reporting units, which had approximately $1,450 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2017, within our electronic systems segment exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 percent. although no impairment exists for this reporting unit, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units, future deterioration of the business or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future revenue.
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years.
our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2017 included deferred tax assets of $409 million and deferred tax liabilities of $34 million. this compares with deferred tax assets of $549 million and deferred tax liabilities of $4 million as of july 1, 2016. for all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, was $183 million as of june 30, 2017 and $271 million as of july 1, 2016. the decrease in valuation allowance was primarily due to our divestitures of it services and caprock in fiscal 2017, which allowed us to utilize capital loss carryforwards, which had a full valuation allowance against tax gains on those transactions. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

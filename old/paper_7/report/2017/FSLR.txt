executive overview we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions. we design, manufacture, and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. additionally, we provide o&m services to system owners. we have substantial, ongoing r&d efforts focused on module and system-level innovations. we are the world's largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world's largest pv solar module manufacturers. our mission is to provide cost-advantaged solar technology through innovation, customer engagement, industry leadership, and operational excellence.
certain highlights of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31, 2017 include the following:
•   net sales in 2017 were $2.9 billion, which was consistent with net sales in 2016. such results were primarily driven by the sale of the moapa, california flats, switch station, and cuyama projects in 2017, together with an increase in third-party module sales in 2017 compared to 2016, offset by the completion of substantially all construction activities on a number of projects in 2016, including the desert stateline, astoria, taylor, east pecos, silver state south, butler, and mccoy projects.
•   gross profit decreased 3.3 percentage points to 18.7% during 2017 from 22.0% during 2016 primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction during the period and reductions in the average selling price per watt of our modules sold directly to third parties, partially offset by reductions in our product warranty liability and our module collection and recycling liability.
•   as of december 31, 2017, we had 18 installed production lines at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia. we produced 2.3 gw of solar modules during 2017, which represented a 26% decrease from 2016. the decrease in production was primarily driven by our previously announced plans to ramp down production of our series 4 modules and transition to series 6 module manufacturing over the next several years. we expect to produce approximately 3.1 gw of solar modules during 2018, including approximately 1 gw of series 6 modules.
•   in november 2017, we produced our initial series 6 modules at our manufacturing facility in perrysburg, ohio. we continue to qualify such modules for commercial production and expect the ohio facility to begin commercial production in early 2018. in late 2017, we also began installing series 6 production lines at our facility in kulim, malaysia.
•   during 2017, we ran our manufacturing facilities at approximately 99% capacity utilization, which represented a 2.0 percentage point increase from 2016.
•   the average conversion efficiency of our modules produced in 2017 was 16.9%, which represented an improvement of 0.5 percentage points from our average conversion efficiency of 16.4% in 2016.
market overview the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. in particular, module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years, and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further
50
increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, epc companies, and vertically-integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. in light of such market realities, we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module and system technologies, our manufacturing process, our vertically-integrated business model, our financial viability, and the sustainability of our modules and systems.
worldwide solar markets continue to develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system levels, which make solar power more affordable. we are developing, constructing, and operating multiple solar projects around the world as we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline. we expect a significant portion of our future consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows to be derived from such projects. we also continue to develop our early-to-mid-stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to further expand both our early-to-mid-stage and advanced-stage project pipelines. see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for additional information about projects within our advanced-stage project pipeline.
lower industry module and system pricing, while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers (particularly manufacturers with higher cost structures), is expected to continue to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy solutions. over time, we believe that solar energy generation will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy generation. in the near term, however, declining average selling prices are expected to adversely affect our results of operations relative to prior years. if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs; bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, epc agreements, and ppas; or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be further adversely affected. in certain markets in california and elsewhere, an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may further contribute to reduce short-to-medium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years, lower ppa pricing, and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets. we continue to mitigate these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements, including our transition to series 6 module manufacturing, continuing the development of key markets, and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives, including both manufacturing, bos, and other operating costs.
we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects. solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes, including conversion efficiency, energy yield, and reliability, and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value, return on equity, and lcoe. as noted above, competition on the basis of selling price per watt has intensified in recent years, which has contributed to declines in module average selling prices in several key markets. many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers are transitioning from lower efficiency bsf multi-crystalline cells (the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets) to higher efficiency perc multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline cells at competitive cost structures. additionally, while conventional solar modules, including the solar modules we produce, are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side, certain manufacturers of mono-crystalline perc solar modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. we believe the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules is being enabled by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china. bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency, but by converting both front and rear side irradiance, such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations, which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules, including the modules we produce.
we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems is highly competitive. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency, proprietary manufacturing technology (which enables us to
51
produce a cdte module in less than 3.5 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), and our operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years, and polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives, such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology, contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers.
given the smaller size (sometimes referred to as form factor) of our current series 4 modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules, we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with the construction of systems using our series 4 modules. thus, to compete effectively on an lcoe basis, our series 4 modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon-based modules with larger form factors. we recently introduced our next generation series 6 module technology, which is expected to enable the production of modules with a larger form factor along with better product attributes and a lower manufacturing cost structure. accordingly, the larger form factor of our series 6 modules is expected to reduce the number of electrical connections and hardware required for system installation. the resulting labor and material savings are expected to represent a significant improvement compared to current technologies and a substantial reduction in total installed system costs resulting in improved project returns as bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale system.
in terms of energy yield, in many climates, our cdte modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most conventional crystalline silicon solar modules (including bsf and perc technologies) of equivalent efficiency rating. for example, our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system's generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c (standard test conditions). in addition, our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards. our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs. as a result of these and other factors, our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity.
while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression, further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems, erosion in our market share for modules and systems, and/or declines in overall net sales. we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps, continuing to make technological advances at the system level, using innovative installation techniques and know-how, and leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. see item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our long-term strategic plans are focused on our goal to create long-term shareholder value through a balance of growth, profitability, and liquidity. in executing such plans, we are focusing on providing utility-scale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale pv electricity, including markets throughout the americas, the asia-pacific region, and certain other strategic markets. additionally,
52
we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis, or complement such generation offerings. such focus on our core module and utility-scale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, particularly in the united states. while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utility-scale based offerings in the next several years, we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. additionally, our ability to provide utility-scale offerings on economically attractive terms depends, in part, on certain market factors outside of our control, such as interest rate fluctuations, domestic or international trade policies, and government support programs. adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utility-scale systems, which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers.
we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our key markets. we have dedicated, and intend to continue to dedicate, significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy, to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions, and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market. we expect that, over time, the majority of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above. the timing, execution, and financial impacts of our long-term strategic plans are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in item 1a. "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand, relatively high existing electricity prices, strong demand for renewable energy generation, and high solar resources.
creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions. for example, our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins, which may adversely affect our results of operations. we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time, and possibly vary from our internal long-range profitability expectations and targets, depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions, traditional or otherwise, that are available to potential customers. in addition, as we execute on our long-term strategic plans, we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in emerging technologies, such as commercially viable energy storage solutions, which are expected to further enable pv solar power systems to compete with traditional forms of energy generation by shifting the delivery of energy generated by such systems to periods of greater demand. such storage solutions continue to evolve in terms of technology and cost, and global deployments of storage capacity are expected to exceed 100 gw by 2030, representing a significant increase in the potential market for renewable energy. we will also continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar projects. market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the solar projects we are developing, whereas, conversely, market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such solar projects.
on occasion, we may temporarily own and operate certain systems with the intention to sell them at a later date. we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an off-taker, such as a utility, but rather an intent to sell a portion of or all the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold. expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full offtake of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a fully contracted ppa. additionally, our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct, potentially for a period of up to several years. in each of the above mentioned examples, we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity.
53
we continually evaluate forecasted global demand, competition, and our addressable market, and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition. in july 2017, we announced our plans to utilize our idled vietnamese manufacturing plant for production of our next generation series 6 module technology. this decision is expected to provide us with several operational benefits, including (i) the ability to add additional series 6 production lines without ramping down current series 4 production, (ii) flexibility in production capacity during our series 6 transition period, and (iii) installing series 6 production lines in a facility that is substantially identical to our malaysian manufacturing plant where such lines are currently being installed, which is expected to accelerate and facilitate a cost-effective installation. our vietnamese plant, including the recently announced expansion of a second series 6 production line at the facility, and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of liquidity and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a. "risk factors," including those described under the headings "our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, convert existing production facilities to support new product lines, such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a cost-effective manner, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties" and "if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules, it may impair any future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers."
8point3 energy partners lp in june 2015, the 8point energy partners lp or "the partnership" completed its ipo. as part of the offering, we contributed interests in various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for an ownership interest in the entity. since the formation of the partnership, the sponsors have, from time to time, sold interests in solar projects to the partnership, which owns and operates a portfolio of solar energy generation projects.
in february 2018, we entered into an agreement with cd clean energy and infrastructure v jv, llc, an equity fund managed by capital dynamics and certain other co-investors and certain other parties, pursuant to which such parties agreed to acquire our interests in the partnership and its subsidiaries. in connection with the transaction, we entered into an agreement with capital dynamics and certain other parties, whereby we and sunpower have agreed, among other things, to vote to approve the merger agreement at any meeting of shareholders of the partnership for such purpose, as shareholders of the partnership and holders of equity units in opco.
for additional information on the partnership, see item 1a. "risk factors - we may be unable to complete the sale of our interests in 8point3 energy partners lp on the terms and in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, and if we are unable to complete such sale, we may continue to hold the interests and may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of the partnership, or the sale could result in shareholder litigation" and note 12. "investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures - 8point3 energy partners lp" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize, as of february 22, 2018, our approximately 2.2 gw advanced-stage project pipeline. the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mwac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mwdc, which will be greater than the mwac size pursuant to a dc-ac ratio typically ranging from 1.2 to 1.3. such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors. projects are typically removed from our advanced-stage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized. projects, or portions of projects, may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epc-contracted or partner-developed project does not obtain permitting or financing, a project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors, or we decide to temporarily own and operate, or retain interests in, such projects based on strategic opportunities or market factors.

segment overview we operate our business in two segments. our modules segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of cdte solar modules to third parties, and our systems segment includes the development, construction, operation, maintenance, and sale of pv solar power systems, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems. see note 22. "segment and geographical information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our operating segments. see also item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for a description of the system projects in our advanced-stage project pipeline.
beginning with the three months ended december 31, 2017, we changed the composition of our reportable segments to align with revisions to our internal reporting structure and long-term strategic plans. as a result of this change, our modules segment, which was historically referred to as our components segment, includes module sales to third parties and excludes any module sales to our systems segment. previously, we included an allocation of net sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our modules segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our modules segment. our systems segment now includes all net sales from the sale of solar power systems and related products and services, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems. all prior year balances were revised to conform to the current year presentation.

net sales modules business we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power. during 2017, zorlu enerji and rcr o'donnell griffin pty, ltd each accounted for more than 10% of our modules business net sales, and the majority of our solar modules were sold to integrators and operators of systems in the united states, india, and turkey. substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2017 were denominated in u.s. dollars. we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
systems business through our fully integrated systems business, we provide complete turn-key pv solar power systems, or solar solutions, that draw upon our capabilities, which include (i) project development, (ii) epc services, and (iii) o&m services. additionally within our systems segment, we may temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors. we typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods, which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract. we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a system after the project has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer. the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2017, the majority of our systems business net sales were in north america, and the principal customer of our systems business was capital dynamics, which accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales.

net sales from our modules segment increased by $130.9 million in 2017 primarily due to a 68% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 29% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment decreased by $94.2 million in 2017 primarily as a result of the completion of substantially all construction activities on a number of projects in 2016, including the desert stateline, astoria, taylor, east pecos, silver state south, butler, and mccoy projects, partially offset by the sale of the moapa, california flats, switch station, and cuyama projects in 2017.
net sales from our modules segment increased by $448.0 million in 2016 primarily due to a 211% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 5% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment decreased by $1.7 billion in 2016 primarily from the sale of majority interests in the desert stateline, north star, and lost hills projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015, the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016, and lower module plus sales transactions. this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015, the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016, and completion of substantially all construction activities on the astoria project.

research and development expense in 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to lower costs for third-party contracted services, reduced material and module testing costs, the termination of certain r&d programs for legacy module technologies, and lower employee compensation expense resulting from reductions to our r&d headcount as part of various restructuring activities. during 2017, the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules produced was 16.9% compared to 16.4% in 2016. research and development expense in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to reductions in our r&d headcount and employee compensation expense resulting from various restructuring activities. during 2016, the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules was 16.4% compared to 15.6% in 2015.
production start-up production start-up expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs. costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production start-up expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site, related legal and regulatory costs, and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. in general, we expect production start-up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition or replacement of production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility.

during 2017 and 2016, we primarily incurred production start-up expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our facilities in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia. production start-up expense for 2015 was primarily driven by our previous crystalline silicon module manufacturing operations, which we ended in 2016 as further described in note 4. "restructuring and asset impairments" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
restructuring and asset impairments restructuring and asset impairments consists of expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and includes any associated asset impairments, costs for employee termination benefits, costs for contract terminations and penalties, and other restructuring related costs. such restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with then current business conditions and to reduce costs.

as a result of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2016, we impaired the remaining $68.8 million of goodwill of our systems reporting unit primarily due to a strategic shift in the mix of our module and system net sales, which was approved by our board of directors in november 2016 as part of the restructuring activities described above. this shift involved an expected reduction in the annual megawatts sold through systems business projects. other factors that contributed to the impairment included our reduced market capitalization and the challenging conditions within the solar industry as of the date of our testing. in june 2016, we also impaired the remaining $6.1 million of goodwill associated with our crystalline silicon modules reporting unit due to the decision to end the related manufacturing operations as described above. see note 6.

interest income during 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to higher cash balances during the period, higher interest rates associated with such cash balances, and a promissory note with an affiliate issued in late 2016. interest income during 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to higher interest rates on our marketable securities.
interest expense, net interest expense is primarily comprised of interest incurred on long-term debt, settlements of interest rate swap contracts, and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with asc 815. we capitalize interest expense into our project assets or property, plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization, which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period.

income tax expense in december 2017, the u.s. president signed into law the tax act, which significantly revised u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on certain accumulated earnings and profits of foreign corporate subsidiaries (the "transition tax") that may electively be paid over eight years, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to u.s. tax. the tax act also includes many new provisions, such as changes to bonus depreciation, changes to deductions for executive compensation, net operating loss deduction limitations, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") earned by foreign corporate subsidiaries, a base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat"), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income ("fdii"). many of these provisions, including the tax on gilti, the beat, and the deduction for fdii, are not applicable to us until 2018, and we continue to evaluate the impact of such provisions of the tax act.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized an aggregate provisional tax expense of $408.1 million, which included an amount for the transition tax of $401.5 million and a net deferred tax expense of $6.6 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities taking into account the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21%. the final effects of the tax act may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the tax act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act, any updates or changes to estimates utilized to calculate provisional amounts, or actions we may take as a result of the tax act. the associated accounting for the tax act is expected to be completed when our 2017 u.s. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
income tax expense or benefit, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, principally australia, india, and malaysia. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the u.s. will decrease from 35% to 21% beginning in january 2018, while the tax rates in australia, india, and malaysia are 30%, 34.6%, and 24%, respectively. in malaysia, we have been granted a long-term tax holiday, scheduled to expire in 2027, pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax.

our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions. the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period, but are not consistent from period to period. income tax expense increased by $348.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to provisional tax expense of $408.1 million related to the tax act as described above, higher pretax income, a $35.4 million reversal of an uncertain tax position in 2016 related to the income of a foreign subsidiary, and lower excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, partially offset by certain u.s. taxes in 2016 on a cash distribution received from a foreign subsidiary and a $42.1 million discrete tax benefit associated with the acceptance of our election to classify certain of our german subsidiaries as disregarded entities of first solar, inc.
income tax expense decreased by $9.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of lower pretax income and the $35.4 million reversal of an uncertain tax position as described above, partially offset by certain u.s. taxes on a cash distribution received from a foreign subsidiary and a $41.7 million discrete tax benefit associated with the receipt of a private letter ruling during 2015. see note 19.

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the recognition of a gain of $125.1 million, net of tax, in december 2016 from the sale of our residual interest in the desert stateline project to 8point3 operating company, llc ("opco"), a subsidiary of the partnership, and lower equity in earnings from our investment in opco. equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the desert stateline project in 2016 described above, the deferral of certain profit on the sale of our controlling interest in the desert stateline project in 2015, and higher equity in earnings from our investment in opco during the period.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2017, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, advanced-stage project pipeline, availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements, and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital, systems project investment, and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally.
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and strategic discretionary spending. in the future, we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings, including project specific debt financings. we believe that when necessary, we will have adequate access to the capital markets, although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industry-wide or company-specific concerns. such financings could result in increased debt service expenses, dilution to our existing stockholders, or restrictive covenants which require us to maintain certain financial conditions.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.0 billion as of december 31, 2016. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2017 increased primarily from the sale of the moapa, california flats, switch station, and cuyama projects and proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment. as of december 31, 2017, $1.6 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in u.s. dollar, euro, and japanese yen denominated holdings. as of december 31, 2016, $1.2 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in u.s. dollar, euro, and malaysian ringgit denominated holdings.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we may be required to accrue and pay certain u.s. and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds. although we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside of the u.s., with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany, we continue to evaluate how the tax act may affect our plans to repatriate additional amounts
64
to fund our domestic operations or otherwise deploy our worldwide cash. in addition, changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances, which could negatively impact our access to capital, resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future. the net amount of our project assets and related portion of deferred revenue, which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects, was $0.5 billion as of december 31, 2017. solar power project development and construction cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system, vary substantially and can take many years to mature. as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects using our working capital, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects. delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are self-financing may also impact our liquidity. we have historically financed these up-front systems project investments primarily using working capital. in certain circumstances, we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital, if project financing becomes unavailable due to market-wide, regional, or other concerns.
from time to time, we develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years. given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the u.s. dollar in some of these markets, we continue to explore local financing alternatives. should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive, we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted.
additionally, we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so. if, for example, we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership, we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms. the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project. as of december 31, 2017, we had $0.4 billion of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service, primarily in international markets. we have elected, and may in the future elect, to enter into temporary or long-term project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems. we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects, which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be realized over time.
the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2018 and beyond:
•   we expect to make significant capital investments over the next several years as we transition our production to series 6 module technology and purchase the related manufacturing equipment and infrastructure. such investments also include the commencement and expansion of operations at our previously announced manufacturing plant in vietnam. we expect the aggregate capital investment for currently planned series 6 related programs to be approximately $1.4 billion, including $0.5 billion of capital expenditures already made as of december 31, 2017. such programs are expected to provide an annual series 6 manufacturing capacity of approximately 5 gw once completed. during 2018, we expect to spend $650 million to $750 million for capital expenditures, the majority of which is associated with the series 6 transition. we believe these capital expenditures will increase our aggregate manufacturing capacity, increase our solar module conversion efficiencies, reduce our manufacturing costs, and reduce the overall cost of systems using our modules.
•   the balance of our solar module inventories and bos parts was $151.4 million as of december 31, 2017. as we continue to develop and construct our advanced-stage project pipeline, we must produce solar modules and procure bos parts in the required volumes to support our planned construction schedules. as part of the construction cycle, we typically produce or procure such inventories in advance of receiving payment for such materials, which may temporarily reduce our liquidity. once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a
65
project, they are classified as either project assets, pv solar power systems, or cost of sales depending on whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether other revenue recognition criteria have been met. we also produce significant volumes of modules for sale directly to third-parties, which requires us to carry inventories at levels sufficient to satisfy the demand of our customers and the needs of their utility-scale projects, which may also temporarily reduce our liquidity.
•   we may commit working capital during 2018 and beyond to acquire solar power projects in various stages of development, including advanced-stage projects with ppas, and to continue developing those projects as necessary. depending upon the size and stage of development, costs to acquire such solar power projects could be significant. when evaluating project acquisition opportunities, we consider both the strategic and financial benefits of any such acquisitions.
•   we have initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers. some of these arrangements may involve significant investments or other allocations of capital that could reduce our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing, assuming such sources are available to us. additionally, we have elected and may in the future elect or be required to temporarily retain a noncontrolling ownership interest in certain underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct. any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments.

net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                                       192,045              (136,393   )           101,207
effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash               8,866                (6,306   )           (19,272   )
net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash                    $914,786              $208,574             $(399,451   )
operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 was primarily driven by the sale of the moapa, california flats, switch station, and cuyama projects, partially offset by expenditures for the construction of certain projects. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was primarily due to the lower volume of solar power projects under development and construction, which generally require significant liquidity when such projects are financed using working capital. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was also driven by the sale of certain other solar power projects at or near substantial completion.
investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments of $291.5 million in 2016, including the sale of our remaining interest in the desert stateline project, (ii) an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment driven by our transition to series 6 module manufacturing, and (iii) net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments of $114.7 million in 2017 compared to net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments of $102.9 million in 2016. the increase in net cash provided by investing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments described above and (ii) higher net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments also described above compared to net purchases of marketable
66
securities and restricted investments of $203.1 million in 2015, partially offset by the receipt of $239.0 million from the ipo of the partnership in 2015.
financing activities the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily the result of net proceeds from borrowings under long-term debt arrangements associated with the construction of certain projects in japan, india, and australia of $191.3 million in 2017 compared to net repayments on such debt arrangements of $110.6 million in 2016 and proceeds from commercial letters of credit for the construction of certain projects in india of $43.0 million. cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily driven by the net repayments of long-term debt arrangements described above compared to net proceeds from borrowings under such debt arrangements of $98.9 million in 2015.

critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information as appropriate. the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following:
revenue recognition - solar power system sales and/or engineering, procurement, and construction services. we generally recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems and/or epc services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer. furthermore, the sale of a solar power system when combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset. for such sales arrangements, we recognize revenue using cost based input methods, which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs of the contract. for sales of solar power systems in which we obtain an interest in the project sold to the customer, we recognize all of the revenue for the consideration received, including the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtained. we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a solar power system after it has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer.
estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtain begins with the valuation of the entire solar project (i.e., solar power system) being sold to the customer. such valuation generally uses an income based valuation technique in which relevant cash flows are discounted to estimate the expected economic earnings capacity of the project. typical factors considered in a project's valuation include expected energy generation, the duration and pricing of the ppa, the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa (i.e., merchant pricing curves), other offtake agreements, the useful life of the system, tax attributes such as accelerated depreciation and tax credits, sales of renewable energy certificates, interconnection rights, operating agreements, and the cost of capital. once the overall project valuation is agreed upon with the customer, we determine the relative value related to our specific ownership interests conveyed through the transaction agreements, including the membership interest purchase and sale agreement and the limited liability company agreement (or equivalent) of the project or its holding company.
in applying cost based input methods of revenue recognition, we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs (including solar module costs) to determine our progress towards contract completion and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and gross profit to recognize. cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy long-term construction contracts and therefore reflect the
68
transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts. costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations ("inefficient costs") are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer. costs incurred towards contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules, direct materials, labor, subcontractors, and other indirect costs related to contract performance. we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system. cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. in making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues, including the impact of any performance incentives, liquidated damages, and other payments to customers. significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects, including materials, labor, contingencies, and other system costs.
if the estimated total costs on any contract, including any inefficient costs, are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract. such revisions could occur in any reporting period, and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates.
as part of our solar power system sales, we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement. in addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system's operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. in certain instances, a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level. conversely, if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests, we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price. such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur.
revenue recognition - operations and maintenance. we recognize revenue for standard, recurring o&m services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. costs of o&m services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. as part of our o&m service offerings, we typically offer an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold, we may receive a bonus payment, or if system availability falls below a separate threshold, we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa. such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the o&m services.
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability-weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials; the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center; the material, labor, capital costs; the scale of recycling centers; and an estimated third-party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. we base these estimates on (i) our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules, (ii) the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling, and (iii) the expected
69
economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly.
as of december 31, 2017, our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was $166.6 million. a 1% increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by $33.5 million, and a 1% decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by $28.1 million.
product warranties. we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.5% every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25-year performance warranty period.
as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. this system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system-level limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty.
in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above, for pv solar power systems we construct, we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system.
when we recognize revenue for module or system sales, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites, our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos parts, and our estimated per-module replacement costs. as a result of such factors, we estimate our limited product warranties based on warranty return rates of approximately 1% to 3% for modules covered under warranty, depending on the series of module technology.
as of december 31, 2017, our accrued liabilities for product warranties were $224.3 million. a 1% change in estimated warranty return rates would change our module warranty liability by $71.0 million, and a 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos parts would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability.
income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, its states and municipalities, and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate.
70
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions. once established, we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment, fine, or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations, assess uncertain tax positions, and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense. conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense.
we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our non-u.s. operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives, including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment exception assertions, and the realizability of deferred tax assets, in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained, or when the initiatives are materially complete. it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months.
asset impairments. we assess long-lived assets classified as "held and used," including our property, plant and equipment; project assets; pv solar power systems; and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise, including consideration of technological obsolescence, that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred. relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels.
when impairment indicators are present, we compare undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the asset group's carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group, (ii) third-party valuations, and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market value for such assets. if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.
71
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we do not amortize goodwill, but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually. we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value.
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. such qualitative impairment test considers various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, the overall financial performance of a reporting unit, and any other relevant events affecting our company or a reporting unit. if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is not required. if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. we may also elect to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test without considering qualitative factors.
the quantitative impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. our reporting units consist of our cdte module manufacturing (or "modules") business and our fully integrated systems business. we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we primarily use an income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. significant judgment is required when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates used to determine projected cash flows. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired, and no further analysis is required. conversely, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

executive overview our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. we make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, las vegas visitor volume decreased 2%, las vegas strip revpar increased 2% and las vegas strip gaming revenue increased by 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority. results of operations for our domestic resorts during 2017 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and revpar, discussed below. our rooms revenue benefited from robust convention business at our las vegas strip resorts, which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.
gross gaming revenue in the macau market increased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of growth on the cotai strip. additionally, according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government, visitor arrivals increased 5% and overnight visitors increased 10% in 2017 compared to 2016. as a significant number of mgm macau's customers are from mainland china, we believe operating results at mgm macau are affected by economic conditions in mainland china as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland china and macau. we believe a slowdown in china's economic growth rate as well as the implementation of policies related to gaming promoters, the chinese government's restrictions on travel to macau and cross-border currency transactions led to a multi-year decrease in gross gaming revenues for the macau market, which lasted through the first half of 2016 and primarily impacted vip casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations throughout the macau market. despite the impact of these events and concerns over the sustainability of economic growth in china, we expect the macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland china market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within macau. we believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within the macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased year over year in each month beginning in august 2016 and continuing through december 2017.
our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. while we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. for instance, we opened mgm cotai on february 13, 2018. mgm cotai is an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort located on an 18 acre site on the cotai strip in macau. the gaming inspection and coordination bureau of macau ("dicj") approved 100 gaming tables for the opening of mgm cotai and 25 additional gaming tables effective for operation on january 1, 2019, for a total of 125 gaming tables in aggregate. in addition, the dicj approved the initial transfer of 77 gaming tables from mgm macau to mgm cotai.
additionally, we were awarded a casino license to build and operate mgm springfield in springfield, massachusetts. mgm springfield is being developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown springfield. mgm's plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 2,550 slots and 120 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,500 space parking garage; with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $960 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. construction of mgm springfield is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.
in august 2015, we announced the implementation of a profit growth plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. the profit growth plan's initiatives focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth. the profit growth plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and in 2017 we transitioned from the profit growth plan to a continuous improvement approach to explore additional opportunities to drive further improvement.
formation and initial public offering of mgp on april 25, 2016, mgm growth properties llc ("mgp"), a consolidated subsidiary, completed its initial public offering ("ipo"). mgp is organized as an umbrella partnership reit (commonly referred to as an "upreit") structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the operating partnership. mgp has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the "shares"): class a shares and a single class b share.
32
we own mgp's class b share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of mgp or upon liquidation or winding up of mgp. mgp's class a shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the class b share, are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of mgp's shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates' (excluding mgp's) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in mgp and the operating partnership does not fall below 30%. the sole general partner of the operating partnership is also a subsidiary of mgp.
in connection with the formation of mgp, mgp used the proceeds from the ipo to purchase operating partnership units in the operating partnership. concurrently, we contributed the real estate assets associated with the mirage, mandalay bay, luxor, new york-new york, monte carlo, excalibur, the park, gold strike tunica, mgm grand detroit and beau rivage to the operating partnership in exchange for operating partnership units. a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership (the "landlord") subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours (the "tenant") pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the "master lease").
in august 2016, we completed the acquisition of boyd gaming corporation's ("boyd gaming") ownership interest in borgata, at which time borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. subsequently, mgp acquired borgata's real property from us, and in october 2017, mgp also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with mgm national harbor from us. amendments to the master lease agreement provided that we then lease the real estate assets of borgata and mgm national harbor from a subsidiary of the operating partnership. as of december 31, 2017, we owned 73.4% of the operating partnership units, and mgp held the remaining 26.6% ownership interest in the operating partnership.
see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding mgp and its subsidiaries, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and from which we lease certain of our real estate assets pursuant to a master lease agreement. all intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease, have been eliminated in consolidation.
reportable segments we have two reportable segments: domestic resorts and mgm china. we currently own and operate 14 resorts in the united states. mgm china's operations consist of mgm macau resort and mgm cotai on the cotai strip in macau. we have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. citycenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee. our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as "corporate and other" operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results.
domestic resorts. at december 31, 2017, our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:
las vegas, nevada:   bellagio, mgm grand las vegas (including the signature), mandalay bay (including delano and four seasons), the mirage, luxor, new york-new york (including the park), excalibur, monte carlo and circus circus las vegas.

other:               mgm grand detroit in detroit, michigan; beau rivage in biloxi, mississippi; gold strike tunica in tunica, mississippi; borgata in atlantic city, new jersey; and mgm national harbor in prince george's county, maryland.
over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. we market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in las vegas, nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded las vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the united states generally.
key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are:
•   gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); "win" or "hold" percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 20% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle; and

33
•   hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("adr," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("revpar," a summary measure of hotel results, combining adr and occupancy rate). our calculation of adr, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or "cash" rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

mgm china. we own an approximate 56% controlling interest in mgm china, which owns mgm grand paradise, the macau company that owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai, the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. we believe our investment in mgm china plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.
revenues at mgm macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the macau gaming market: vip casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations, and slot machine operations. vip players play mostly in dedicated vip rooms or designated gaming areas. vip customers can be further divided into customers sourced by in-house vip programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. a significant portion of our vip volume is generated through the use of gaming promoters. gaming promoters introduce vip gaming players to mgm macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players. in exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover based commissions. in-house vip players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. mgm macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. unlike gaming promoters and in-house vip players, main floor players do not receive commissions. the profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the vip segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. gaming revenues from the main floor segment have become an increasingly significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.
vip gaming at mgm macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from mgm macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. the nonnegotiable chips allow mgm macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters' clients in order to determine vip gaming play. gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. they also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. the estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to vip customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense. in-house vip commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.
in addition to the key performance indicators used by our domestic resorts, mgm macau utilizes "turnover," which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by mgm macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. turnover provides a basis for measuring vip casino win percentage. win for vip gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover. win for main floor gaming operations at mgm macau is typically in the range of 16-22% of table games drop.
corporate and other. corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. see note 1 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company's unconsolidated affiliates.
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

summary operating results consolidated net revenues for 2017 increased 14% compared to 2016 due primarily to the full year of operations at borgata and mgm national harbor, an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, valet and parking fee revenue at our domestic resorts and an increase in casino revenue at mgm china. consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased 3% compared to 2015 due primarily to the borgata transaction on august 1, 2016, the opening of mgm national harbor in december 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domestic resorts, partially offset by a decrease in casino revenue at mgm china. see "operating results - detailed segment information" below for additional information related to segment revenues.
consolidated operating income was $1.7 billion in 2017 compared to $2.1 billion in 2016. the current year period included a full year of operations at borgata, which included a benefit of $36 million related to borgata's share of a property tax settlement from atlantic city, a full year of operations at mgm national harbor, and a benefit of $45 million related to the modification of the nv energy exit fee, which included the benefit recognized at our domestic resorts as well as our 50% share of the benefit recognized at citycenter. the prior year included a $430 million gain recognized on the borgata acquisition and a $401 million gain related to the sale of the shops at crystals ("crystals") at citycenter, which was offset by charges of $152 million of nv energy exit expense associated with the company's strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of nv energy. operating income at our domestic resorts increased 35%, or $481 million in 2017 compared to 2016, and benefitted from a full year of contributions from borgata and mgm national harbor and a decrease in preopening expense. see "operating results - details of certain charges" below for additional detail on our preopening expense. corporate expense increased to $357 million in 2017 from $313 million in 2016, primarily from a $16 million charge for the operating partnership's share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the mgm national harbor transaction, with the remainder of the increase primarily related to corporate brand campaign expenses, legal expenses, and charitable contributions. operating income at mgm china decreased 24%, or $62 million, compared to 2016 due primarily to an increase in preopening expense related to the mgm cotai project. income from unconsolidated affiliates was $146 million in 2017 compared to $528 million in 2016, which included the gain related to the sale of crystals. see "operating results - income from unconsolidated affiliates" for additional detail.
consolidated operating income was $2.1 billion in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $156 million in 2015. operating income in 2016 was affected by the items discussed above. operating loss in 2015 was negatively affected by a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in mgm china in 2011. the impairment charge resulted from our annual review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for mgm china's resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in the macau market. income from unconsolidated affiliates was $528 million in 2016, as discussed above, compared to $258 million in 2015, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by citycenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. corporate expense increased to $313 million in 2016 from $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives related to the profit growth plan of $23 million, costs associated with the initial public offering of mgp of $25 million, transaction costs incurred in connection with the borgata transaction, incremental performance-based compensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement.

in 2017, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding mgm china, decreased compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average debt outstanding related to our senior notes and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. this was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding under our credit facilities and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility and an increase in the weighted average interest rate. in 2016, interest cost related to mgm resorts, excluding mgm china, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average long-term debt outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with the mgp related financing transactions in april 2016. interest cost related to mgm china increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the mgm china credit facility partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs.
capitalized interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to the opening of mgm national harbor in december 2016, partially offset due to the mgm cotai and mgm springfield projects. capitalized interest in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to the mgm cotai, mgm national harbor, and mgm springfield projects.
non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates. non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $18 million in 2017 compared to 2016, and decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to the acquisition of borgata on august 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. prior to the acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method.
other, net. other expense in 2017 primarily consisted of a $30 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our 11.375% senior notes due 2018, as well as a $14 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to the mgm national harbor credit facility. other expense in 2016 primarily consisted of a $16 million loss on the early retirement of debt related to our 7.625% senior notes due 2017, as well as a $49 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our previously outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 and our prior senior credit facility, recorded in the second quarter of 2016. the previously discussed losses related to the early retirement of debt recorded in 2016 are primarily responsible for the increase in other non-operating expense from 2016 to 2015.

our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required as a result of the enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the borgata transaction, partially offset
41
by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits. our effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the non-cash impairment charge on mgm china goodwill for which we did not record income tax benefit, partially offset by an income tax benefit for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance.
cash taxes paid increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased u.s. taxable income and state income taxes attributable to borgata, which has been consolidated since the august 2016 acquisition of boyd gaming's interest in the company. cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased u.s. taxable income.
non-gaap measures
"adjusted ebitda" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, nv energy exit expense, gain on borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. "adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted ebitda before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the mgm resorts and mgp stock compensation plans, which are not allocated to each property. mgm china recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock-based compensation plan which is included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for mgm china. "same-store adjusted property ebitda" is adjusted property ebitda related to the operating resorts which were consolidated by the company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. "adjusted ebitda margin" is adjusted ebitda divided by net revenues. "same-store adjusted property ebitda margin" is same-store adjusted property ebitda divided by "same-store" net revenues. adjusted ebitda information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies. we present adjusted property ebitda on a "same-store" basis as supplemental information because management believes that providing performance measures on a "same-store" basis is useful for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our domestic casino resorts.
we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, same-store adjusted property ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and same-store adjusted property ebitda margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. for example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. in addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. therefore, we use adjusted property ebitda and same-store adjusted property ebitda as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.
adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, same-store adjusted property ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin or same-store adjusted property ebitda margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, same-store adjusted property ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, or same-store adjusted property ebitda margin. also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda same-store adjusted property ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin or same-store adjusted property ebitda margin information may calculate adjusted ebitda, adjusted property ebitda, same-store adjusted property ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin or same-store adjusted property ebitda margin in a different manner.

47
other factors affecting liquidity anticipated uses of cash. we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. at december 31, 2017, we had $13.0 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $373 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion senior secured credit facility, $2.1 billion outstanding under the $2.7 billion operating partnership credit facility, and $2.3 billion outstanding under the $2.9 billion mgm china credit facility. in the next twelve months, we have due an estimated $710 million of cash interest payments and $820 million of term loan principal payments, of which approximately $774 million relates to mgm china's existing credit facility. mgm china is in the process of amending its credit facility to extend the maturity date, extend the timing of and reduce the amount of scheduled amortization payments, and increase the maximum leverage ratio. we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as planned capital expenditures, over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, and availability under our revolving credit facilities.
in addition, we have made significant investments through december 31, 2017 and we expect to make capital investments as described below during 2018. see "executive overview" for further information regarding the scope and timing of our significant development projects.
•   approximately $640 million in capital expenditures at our domestic resorts and corporate entities, excluding mgm springfield;

•   approximately $455 million on the mgm cotai project, excluding development fees and capitalized interest;

•   approximately $375 million on the mgm springfield project, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs; and

•   approximately $115 million in maintenance capital improvements at mgm china.

our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms. future capital expenditures could vary from our current expectations depending on the progress of our development efforts and the structure of our ownership interests in future developments.
mgm resorts international stock repurchase program. in september 2017, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. the timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. repurchased shares are retired. the remaining availability under the stock repurchase program was approximately $672 million as of december 31, 2017.

off balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in citycenter, grand victoria, and las vegas arena company, llc. we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than the operating partnership's cash flow hedges. see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment facilities in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. we guarantee the t-mobile arena credit facility as described in item 2 - properties. in addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

(3)   refer to note 12 for further information on operating leases.

(4)   reflects future expected cash outlays of our other long-term liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2017, and, accordingly, we have not included such liabilities above that do not have future cash payments, such as deferred rent. we have also excluded deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented in the table as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain.

(5)   our purchase obligations represent minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors, primarily utility and entertainment contracts. also, although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, and hence, have not been included in the table above.

critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts. our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. mgm china extends credit to certain in-house vip gaming customers and gaming promoters. we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau. markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states. we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the united states. mgm china performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 60% and 49%, respectively, of our gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from the united states.
we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. the provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. at domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. at domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information. mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.
in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region's economy occur.
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

casino receivables                                                 $343,869                  $332,443

allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable                  25    %                   28   %
approximately $31 million and $35 million of casino receivables and $7 million and $8 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to mgm china at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. at december 31, 2017, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $3 million.
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost. a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. when we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. in addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. when constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. in addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. for assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. for operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
there are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. first, management must determine the usage of the asset. to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. this means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
on a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. for our 2017 annual impairment test, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative ("step zero") analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the borgata trade name using a discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4%. for our 2016 and 2015 annual impairment tests we utilized the two-step quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow approach for license rights and using the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. the estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying values, with the fair value of the borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the borgata transaction. as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.
we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. with the exception of our mgm china reporting unit, discussed below, none of our other reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2016 or 2015. for our 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for all of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values. we utilized the quantitative analysis for the mgm china reporting unit, for which the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. for our 2016 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. the estimated fair values of reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-step quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying values. as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our mgm china reporting unit. the step one goodwill analysis of the mgm china reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. the decrease in fair value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the mgm china reporting unit as well as those of the mgm china reporting unit's peer group. as a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. as such, we determined the fair values of all assets of the mgm china reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. the fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill. therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the mgm china reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015.
there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. in particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. in addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.
see note 2 and note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates see note 7 and note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we assess our tax positions using a two-step process. a tax position is recognized if it meets a "more likely than not" threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in "other accrued liabilities" or long-term in "other long-term liabilities" based on the time until expected payment. additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

market risk in addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the operating partnership's term loan b facility. a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. as fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

as of december 31, 2017, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 27% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million and $700 million notional amount operating partnership interest rate swaps with weighted average fixed rates that we pay 1.764% and 1.901%, respectively. the following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the operating partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

in addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to mgm china and to our operations at mgm macau and the development of mgm cotai. while recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the united states, china, macau or hong kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the u.s. dollar or the current peg rate for the hong kong dollar will remain at the same level. the possible changes to the peg of the hong kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. as of december 31, 2017, a 1% increase in the hong kong dollar (the functional currency of mgm china) to the u.s. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $7 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $23 million.

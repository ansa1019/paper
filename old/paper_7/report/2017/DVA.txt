item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. all statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and/or strategies for the future. these forward-looking statements may include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, such as expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, estimated charges and accruals, capital expenditures, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our level of indebtedness on our financial performance, and including earnings per share. these statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including risks resulting from the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, including as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations; the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, or enforcement thereof, including among other things those regarding the exchanges, results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare end stage renal disease program or other government-based programs; the impact of the medicare advantage benchmark structure; risks arising from potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation or regulation, including healthcare-related and labor-related legislation or regulation, that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability; the impact of the changing political environment and related developments on the current health care marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the affordable care act, the exchanges and many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace; uncertainties related to the impact of federal tax reform legislation; changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing; legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement (cia) and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and restrictions on our business and operations required by our corporate integrity agreement and other current or potential settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof and our ability to recover any losses related to such legal matters from third parties; continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us; our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings from our recent restructurings; our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector, that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations (acos), independent practice associations (ipas) and integrated delivery systems; our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services to markets outside the united states, or to businesses outside of dialysis; noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; the variability of our cash flows; factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including market conditions, the price of our common stock, our cash flow position and leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory and contractual requirements; the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all; risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements; impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets; the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing, conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions of the dmg sale transaction, potential disruption in connection with the dmg sale transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, and uncertainties related to our use of proceeds from the dmg sale transaction, including our ability to repurchase stock; the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which dmg conducts its business; the risk that the cost of providing services under dmg's agreements may exceed our compensation; the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including medicare advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact dmg's business, revenue and profitability; the risk that dmg may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability; the risk that a disruption in dmg's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on dmg's business operations and profitability; the risk that

company overview the company has consisted of two major divisions, davita kidney care (kidney care) and davita medical group (dmg). kidney care is comprised of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services, our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, and our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is our largest line of business and is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd). dmg is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner.
on december 5, 2017, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our dmg division to collaborative care holdings, llc (optum), a subsidiary of unitedhealth group inc. the transaction is expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. as a result of this pending transaction, the dmg business is classified as held for sale and its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations. in addition, prior periods' presentation has been revised to conform to current year presentation and dmg is not included in our management's discussion and analysis below.
the overall financial performance of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services in 2017 benefited from increased treatment volume from acquired and non-acquired growth and cost control initiatives in our dialysis business. this was partially offset by an increase in labor costs and other center related costs.
some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in 2017 and year over year were as follows:
•   improved clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis operations, including the fifth consecutive year as a leader in cms' quality incentive program;
•   consolidated net revenue growth of 1.6%, which included 2.4% total net revenue growth in our u.s. dialysis segment, despite a decrease of $5 in average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment;
•   solid performance in our normalized non-acquired u.s. dialysis treatment growth of 3.5%, which contributed to an increase of approximately 4.1% in the overall number of u.s. dialysis treatments;
•   a net increase of 160 u.s. dialysis centers, including dialysis centers from the renal ventures acquisition, and a net increase of 83 international dialysis centers;
•   an increase in our overall number of patients we serve in the u.s. of approximately 5.4% in 2017;
•   a decrease in u.s. dialysis and lab related services patient care costs of approximately $2 per treatment and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $1 per treatment; and
•   consolidated operating cash flows of $1.9 billion, or $1.6 billion from continuing operations, which included the net va settlement of $332 million.
we believe 2018 will be challenging. we continue to expect clinical costs to increase due to inflation and a tight labor market and we do not foresee an opportunity to offset these pressures with productivity improvements. with labor cost inflation continuing to outpace medicare reimbursement, we anticipate that margins on our medicare business will continue to experience pressure. in addition, we will experience an increase in benefit costs as we transition to a 401(k) plan match program as our 2017 benefit costs did not include a comparable expense. in 2018 we also anticipate additional reimbursement pressure on our pharmacy business. we remain committed to our plans for international expansion in certain regions, which will continue to require investment. we anticipate that these challenges will be partially offset in 2018 by the expected reduction in income taxes as a result of recent u.s. tax reform legislation. in addition, in connection with our previously announced capital allocation strategy, in 2018 we plan to continue our evaluation of strategic alternatives for various assets in our portfolio.

(1)   for the periods presented in the table above adjusted operating income is defined as operating income before certain items which we do not believe are indicative of ordinary results, including goodwill impairment charges, investment and other asset impairments, restructuring charges, a net settlement gain, gains on ownership changes, estimated accruals for certain legal matters and a settlement charge. adjusted operating income as so defined is a non-gaap measure and is not intended as a substitute for gaap operating income. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.
consolidated net revenues consolidated net revenues for 2017 increased by approximately $170 million, or 1.6%, from 2016. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $222 million, principally as a result of solid volume growth from additional treatments, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5 in average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment and by one less treatment day in 2017, as discussed below. revenue for 2017 was negatively impacted by a decrease of approximately $25 million from 2016 in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from decreases in revenue from our pharmaceutical business, partially offset by an increase in net revenues from expansion in our international business and increases in villagehealth revenues, as described below.
consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $725 million, or 7.3%, from 2015. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $496 million, principally resulted from solid volume growth from additional treatments, one additional treatment day in 2016, and an increase of $4 in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment, as discussed below. in addition, revenue for 2016 increased by approximately $239 million from 2015 in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmaceutical business and from expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives.

consolidated operating income consolidated operating income of $1.813 billion for 2017, which includes goodwill impairment charges of $35 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an equity investment loss of $6 million for goodwill impairments at our apac jv, an impairment of $280 million on our investment in the apac jv, an asset impairment of $15 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business, restructuring charges in our international business of $3 million, a net gain on settlement of $530 million, and a gain adjustment on the 2016 ownership change of our apac jv of $6 million, as discussed below, decreased by $217 million as compared to 2016, which included goodwill impairment charges of $28 million, an investment impairment of $15 million, an estimated gain on the ownership change of our apac jv of $374 million and estimated accruals for legal matters of $16 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2017 decreased by approximately $99 million due to an increase in adjusted operating losses in our ancillary and strategic initiatives of $59 million, an increase in expenses in our corporate administrative support of $31 million, and a decrease in adjusted operating income in u.s. dialysis and related lab services of $9 million, as described below.
consolidated operating income of $2.030 billion for 2016, which included goodwill impairment charges of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an investment impairment of $15 million, an estimated gain on the ownership change of our apac jv of $374 million and estimated accruals for legal matters of $16 million increased by approximately $893 million from 2015, which included estimated impairment charges of approximately $4 million, estimated accruals for legal matters of $22 million and a settlement charge of $495 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $57 million. adjusted consolidated operating income increased primarily as a result of an increase in adjusted operating income in u.s. dialysis and related lab services of $22 million, a decrease in adjusted operating losses in our ancillary and strategic initiatives of $30 million, and a decrease in expenses in our corporate administrative support of $5 million, as described below.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services business our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through a network of 2,510 outpatient dialysis centers which we own and manage through management services agreements, in 46 states and the district of columbia, serving a total of approximately 197,800 patients. we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 37% share of the u.s. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve. in 2017, our overall network of u.s. outpatient dialysis centers increased by 160 dialysis centers, primarily as a result of opening new dialysis centers and from acquisitions of existing dialysis centers. the overall number of patients that we serve in the u.s. increased by approximately 5.4% in 2017, including dialysis patients from the renal ventures acquisition, as compared to 2016.
the stated mission of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. we believe our attention to these three stakeholders-our patients, our business partners, and our teammates-represents a major driver of our long-term performance, although we are subject to the impact of external factors such as government policy, physician practice patterns, commercial payor payment rates and the mix of commercial and government patients, as further described in item 1a risk factors. two principal non-financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the davita quality index (dqi). our clinical outcomes as measured by dqi have improved over each of the past several years, which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. our patient mortality percentages have decreased from 19.0% in 2001 to 13.8% in 2016. for the fifth year in a row, we have been a leader in the industry in qip standards and for the last three years for which data is available, we have been a leader in the industry under the cms five-star quality rating systems. over the last two years our clinical teammate turnover has increased slightly due to increased competition for skilled clinical personnel; however, despite this headwind, we have continued to improve our clinical performance. we will continue to focus on these three stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long-term value drivers.
we believe our national scale, size and commitment to our patients, among other things, allows us to provide industry-leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients, referring physicians, and qualified medical directors to our network, which in turn provides our dialysis patient base with a large number of outpatient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a full range of other integrated services, which in turn provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently manage a patient's care and certain costs while still maintaining strong legal and compliance programs.

the following graph summarizes our u.s. dialysis services revenues by modality for the year ended december 31, 2017:
approximately 86% of our 2017 consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business. approximately 79% of our 2017 dialysis services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in our 2,471 consolidated u.s. dialysis centers. other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home-based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis and management and administrative services provided to dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly owned by third parties. these services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2017 u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues are:
•   the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis and home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
•   average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of commercial and government patients.
the total u.s. dialysis patient base is a relatively stable and growing factor, and is fundamentally influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, as well as mortality rates that are common for patients with esrd. the united states renal data system has reported an approximate compound annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2015 for the u.s. dialysis patient population.
we believe our ability to maintain a stable or growing share of the u.s. dialysis patient base is influenced by the quality of our relationships with referring physicians and the quality of our clinical care, which can lead to reduced patient mortality rates, as described above, as well as our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers.
our average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment is driven by changes in our mix of commercial and government (principally medicare and medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment. the percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out-of-network providers has continued to increase, which can significantly affect our average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment since commercial payment rates for patients with out-of-network providers are on average higher than in-network payment rates that are covered under commercial contracted plans.
in addition, growth of our government-based patients outpaced the growth of our commercial patients in 2017 due to a decrease in exchange patients. government dialysis-related payment rates in the u.s. are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate encompassing all goods and services provided during
75
the dialysis treatment, including certain pharmaceuticals such as epogen® (epo), vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the amount of pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. under the esrd pps, the bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures set annually by cms through qip, which was established by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.
this bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks as further described in the risk factor in item 1a risk factors under the heading "changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition." for example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive. in addition, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the esrd bundle, cms' failure to adequately calculate the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business, as well as the potential implementation of or changes in coverage determinations or other rules or regulations by cms or macs that may impact reimbursement. an important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket inflation update, to the esrd pps base rate. absent action by congress, the pps base rate is automatically updated annually by a formulaic inflation adjustment.
in december 2013, cms issued the 2014 final rule for the esrd pps, which phases in the payment reductions mandated by atra, as modified by the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 which reduced our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2016 and 2017, and by 1% in 2018. in november 2017, cms published the 2018 final rule for the esrd pps, which increased dialysis facilities' bundled payment rate for 2018 relative to prior years. in particular, cms projects that the 2018 final rule for the esrd pps will (i) increase the total payments to all esrd facilities by 0.5% in 2018 compared to 2017; (ii) increase total payments to hospital-based esrd facilities by 0.7% in 2018 compared to 2017; and (iii) increase total payments for freestanding facilities by 0.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. the 2018 final rule for esrd pps also implements changes to the pps outlier policy, broadening the pricing methodologies used to determine the cost of certain service drugs and biologicals in computing outlier payments when average sales price data is not available.
as a result of the bca and subsequent activity in congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect on april 1, 2013, reducing medicare payments by 2% which was subsequently extended through fiscal year 2027. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the cms innovation center is working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement acos and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. we are uncertain of the extent to which the long-term operation and evolution of these models of care, including acos, bundled payments for care improvement initiative, the cec model (which includes the development of escos), the comprehensive primary care initiative, the duals demonstration, or other models, will impact the healthcare market over time. our u.s. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. we currently participate in the cec model with the innovation center, including with the esco organizations in the arizona, florida, and adjacent new jersey and pennsylvania markets. in areas where we are not directly participating in this or other innovation center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's or other programs' calculations.
the department of health and human services (hhs) has also pledged to tie 50% of medicare payments to quality or alternate payment models by the end of 2018. as new models of care emerge and evolve, we may be at risk for losing our medicare patient base, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. other initiatives in the government or private sector may also arise, including the development of models similar to acos, independent practice associations (ipas) and integrated delivery systems or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2018 that will outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing regulatory requirements, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
76
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. our commercial payment rates also include payments for out-of-network patients that on average are higher than our in-network commercial contract rates. we continue to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. however, some contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to the bundled payment. we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and if our negotiations result in overall commercial contract payment rate reductions in excess of our commercial contract payment rate increases, or if commercial payors implement plans that restrict access to coverage or the duration or breadth of benefits or impose restrictions or limitations on patient access to commercial plans on non-contracted or out-of-network providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, if there is an increase in job losses in the u.s., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system by cms and/or the impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial insurance plans and/or an increase in uninsured or underinsured patients. patients with commercial insurance who cannot otherwise maintain coverage frequently rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. if these patients are unable to obtain or continue to receive or receive for a limited duration, such financial assistance, or if our assumptions about how patients will respond to any change in such financial assistance are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for further details, see the risk factor in item 1a risk factors under the heading "if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition."
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment we recognize and are able to collect. over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks, and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. we continue to upgrade our billing and other systems; however, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, such as changes to what is included in the bundled payment from medicare, we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection performance, which would affect our average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment.
our u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current period financial statements based upon on-going actual experience and trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.
our average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates; government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments covered under medicare's bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics; and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients and the number of commercial patients that are either covered under commercial contracts or are out of network.
our annual average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment was approximately $330, $336 and $332 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in 2017, our average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $5 per treatment due to a decrease in our commercial treatment volume, a decline in our commercial payor mix, including exchange patients, and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts. in 2016, our average u.s. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment increased by approximately $4 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and certain professional fees. however, other cost categories can also present significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, insurance costs and medical supply costs. in addition, currently pending and future proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to challenge and, if implemented, impose additional requirements on our operations, including increases in the required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical personnel, minimum transition times between treatments, limits on how much patients may be charged for care, limitations as to the amount that can be spent on certain medical costs, and a ceiling on the percent of profit for such care. changes such as these mandated by currently pending and future ballot initiatives or
77
referendums, legislation or policy changes would likely materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating expense and impact our ability to staff our clinics to the new, elevated staffing levels, in particular given the ongoing nationwide shortage of healthcare workers, especially nurses.
our average clinical hours per treatment, or productivity levels, were flat in 2017 compared to 2016. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new requirements, which can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. in addition, improvements in the u.s. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel resulting in slightly higher teammate turnover in 2017, which we believe negatively affected productivity levels. in 2017 and 2016, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 4.0% and 2.8%, respectively, consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the high demand for and nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. in 2018, we will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of up to $100 million as we finish the transition from a profit sharing program to a 401(k) match program. with the old program, we accrued for the expense in the calendar year before payout; with the new program, we will accrue for the expense as we pay out. this accounting change created a one-year gap in 2017 when we did not need to accrue for any such payouts. we also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. in 2017, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity.
our u.s. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented 8.1% and 8.2% of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. although slightly down as a percent of net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased by $9 million, primarily due to an increase in labor and benefit costs and occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term compensation, profit sharing and travel expenses. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, and professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems. we expect that these levels of expenditures on our u.s. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses will continue in 2018 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters.

(1)   for the periods presented in the table above adjusted operating income is defined as operating income before certain items which we do not believe are indicative of ordinary results, including a net settlement gain and a settlement charge related to a legal matter. adjusted operating income as so defined is a non-gaap measure and is not intended as a substitute for gaap operating income. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.
net revenues u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2017 increased by approximately $222 million, or 2.4%, from 2016. this increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.1% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatments, including the acquisition of renal ventures. u.s. dialysis and related lab services' net revenues was negatively impacted by approximately one less treatment day in 2017 as compared to 2016, a decrease in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $5, primarily due to a decrease in our commercial payor mix, including exchange patients. in addition, our provision for uncollectible accounts increased by $52 million in 2017.
79
u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $496 million, or 5.7%, from 2015. this increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.5% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers, as well as one additional treatment day in 2016 as compared to 2015. u.s. dialysis and related lab services' net revenues also benefited from an increase in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $4, primarily due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix. in addition, our provision for uncollectible accounts increased by $24 million in 2016.
the following table summarizes our u.s. dialysis services revenues by source:

total u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues   100   %     100   %     100   %
approximately 67% of our total u.s. dialysis services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 were from government-based programs, principally medicare, medicaid, medicare-assigned and managed medicaid plans, representing approximately 89.5% of our total patients. over the last year we have seen a decline in our commercial patients, which have been outpaced by the growth of our government-based patients. less than 1% of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. there is no single commercial payor that accounted for more than 10% of total u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment. for a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three month waiting period, or earlier if the patient's commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rates we receive for that patient shift from the commercial insurance plan rates to medicare payment rates, which on average are significantly lower than commercial insurance rates. medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis services, and we therefore lose money on each medicare treatment that we provide.
nearly all of our net earnings from our u.s. dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others of which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for out-of-network patients, which are typically higher than commercial contracted rates. if we experience an overall net reduction in our contracted and non-contracted commercial payment rates as a result of negotiations, restrictions or changes to the healthcare regulatory system, including the potential impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
operating expenses and charges patient care costs. u.s. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers. u.s. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $224 and $226 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. the $2 decrease in per treatment costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pharmaceutical unit costs due to a net price reduction as well as a decrease in profit sharing expense. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in labor and benefit costs due to an increase in teammates and clinical labor rates, and an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including the impact of the hurricanes during the third quarter of 2017.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $226 and $221 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the $5 increase in per treatment costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefit costs due to a decrease in productivity, increased turnover and clinical labor rates, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers and an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.
80
general and administrative expenses. u.s. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2017 increased by approximately $9 million as compared to 2016. this increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs, and occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term incentive compensation, profit sharing and travel expenses.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased by approximately $42 million as compared to 2015. this increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs, occupancy, and legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense.
depreciation and amortization. u.s. dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2017 increased by approximately $38 million as compared to 2016 and increased by $45 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. the increases were primarily due to both growth through new dialysis center developments and acquisitions as well as additional informational technology initiatives.
gain on settlement, net. during the first quarter of 2017, we reached an agreement with the government for amounts owed to us for dialysis services provided from 2005 through 2011 to patients covered by the department of veterans affairs (va). as a result of this settlement we recognized a one-time net gain of $527 million as well as equity investment income of $3 million for our share of the settlement recognized by our nonconsolidated joint ventures. as such, the total effect of this settlement on our operating income was an increase of $530 million.
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business was 4.9% for 2017 and 4.5% for both 2016 and 2015. we continue to experience higher amounts of accounts receivable write-offs due to uninsured and underinsured patients. we assess our level of provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical cash collection experience and trends, and have and will continue to adjust the provision as necessary as a result of changes in expectations based on our cash collections.
equity investment income. equity investment income was approximately $25 million, $18 million and $15 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increases in equity investment income over the last three years were primarily due to the increase in the number of our nonconsolidated dialysis joint ventures and an increase in profitability at some of these joint ventures.
segment operating income u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2017, which includes a net gain on the va settlement of $530 million, increased by approximately $520 million as compared to 2016. excluding this item from 2017, u.s. dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income decreased by approximately $9 million from 2016. this decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to a decrease in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $5, one less treatment day, partially offset by treatment growth, as described above. adjusted operating income also decreased due to an increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower patient care costs, as described above.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $517 million as compared to 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million. excluding this item from 2015, u.s. dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income increased by $22 million. this increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments, one additional treatment day, and an increase in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $4, as described above. adjusted operating income also increased due to a decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher patient care costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses, as described above.
other-ancillary services and strategic initiatives business our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2017, these consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, clinical research programs, physician services, direct primary care, esrd seamless care organizations, and comprehensive care as well as our international operations.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and international operations among others, generated approximately $1.6 billion of net revenues in 2017, representing approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenues. we expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. in addition, in connection with our
81
previously announced capital allocation strategy, in 2018 we plan to continue our evaluation of strategic alternatives for various assets in our portfolio. any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of our strategic initiatives. if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we may determine to exit the line of business. we could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. in addition, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives. in that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment charges related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including in our international and pharmacy businesses.
as of december 31, 2017, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 237 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the u.s. the total net revenues generated from our international operations, as reflected below, were approximately 3% of our 2017 consolidated net revenues.

net revenues ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2017 decreased by approximately $25 million, or 1.5%, as compared to 2016. this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in volume in our pharmaceutical business, partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical rates, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues, an increase in shared savings revenue recognized by our esco joint ventures and an increase in net revenues from expansions in our international business and other strategic initiatives.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $239 million, or 17.3%, as compared to 2015. this increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from expansions in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our pharmacy services volume.
operating and general expenses ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating and general expenses for 2017, which includes restructuring charges related to our international business of $3 million, increased by approximately $25 million from 2016, which included an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses increased by $38 million. this increase in adjusted operating and general expenses was primarily related to an increase in medical costs at villagehealth, an increase in labor and benefits costs and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, including losses from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates included in equity investment income, partially offset by a decrease in pharmaceutical costs due to decreased volume in our pharmacy services business.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating and general expenses for 2016, which includes an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million, increased by approximately $203 million from 2015, which included an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $22 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses increased by $209 million. this increase in adjusted operating and general expenses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, labor and benefit costs, professional fees, other general and administration expenses, and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, partially offset by a decrease in prescription dispensing volume, long-term incentive compensation expense and foreign currency gains.
investment and other asset impairments during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash other-than-temporary impairment charge of $280 million on our investment in the apac jv. this charge resulted from changes in our expectations for the joint venture based on continuing market research and assessments by both us and the davita care pte. ltd. (the apac jv) concerning the size of the addressable market available to the joint venture at attractive risk-adjusted returns. we estimated the fair value of our retained interest in the apac jv with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm based on information available to management as of december 31, 2017. after this charge, our investment in the apac jv was carried at $160 million as of december 31, 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we also recognized other asset impairment charges of $15 million related to a restructuring of our pharmacy business.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized an impairment of $15 million related to an investment in one of our international reporting units.
goodwill impairment charges during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit as a result of changes in future governmental reimbursement rates for this business and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of $35 million at our vascular access reporting unit. this charge resulted primarily from continuing changes in our outlook for this business unit as our partners and operators continued to evaluate and make decisions concerning changes in operations, including termination
84
of their management services agreements and center closures as a result of the changes in reimbursement structure discussed above. as of december 31, 2017, there was no goodwill remaining at our vascular access reporting unit.
we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $2 million at one of our international reporting units during the year ended december 31, 2017 and $4 million at another international reporting unit during the year ended december 31, 2015.
restructuring charges during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized total restructuring charges related to our international business of $2 million and recognized equity investment losses of $1 million related to restructuring charges at our apac jv. these restructuring charges were related to a reorganization of our international general and administrative infrastructure at the global, regional and county levels in order to improve efficiency.
gain on changes in ownership interests in apac jv as a result of our agreement with khazanah nasional berhad (khazanah) and mitsui and co., ltd (mitsui) concerning the apac jv, we recorded an additional $6 million non-cash gain during the year ended december 31, 2017 related to a change in estimate of pending post-closing adjustments for the 2016 formation of this joint venture.
in 2016 we deconsolidated our asia pacific dialysis business and recognized an initial non-cash non-taxable estimated gain of $374 million on our retained investment in the apac jv net of contingent obligations as a result of adjusting the carrying value of our retained interest in the apac jv to our proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the business.
segment operating (loss) income ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating results for 2017, which include goodwill impairment charges of $35 million at our vascular access reporting unit, an impairment of $280 million on our investment in the apac jv, an asset impairment of $15 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business, equity investment losses of $6 million related to goodwill impairments at our apac jv, restructuring charges related to our international business of $3 million and an adjustment to the gain on the 2016 ownership change of our apac jv of $6 million, decreased by approximately $706 million from the same period in 2016, which included an estimated gain on the ownership change of our apac jv of $374 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million at our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million and an investment impairment of $15 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating losses increased by $59 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenues in our pharmacy services business, an increase in medical costs, higher labor and benefits costs, and additional expenses associated with our international operations, partially offset by an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues, an increase in shared savings revenue recognized by our esco joint ventures, an increase in net revenues from expansion in our international business, and a decrease in pharmaceutical costs due to decreased volume in our pharmacy services business.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating results for 2016, which includes an estimated gain on the ownership change of our apac jv of $374 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million at our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million and an investment impairment of $15 million, increased by approximately $372 million from 2015, which included an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating losses decreased by $30 million. this decrease in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. the decrease in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, higher labor and benefits costs and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion.
corporate level charges debt expense. debt expense for 2017, 2016, and 2015 consisted of interest expense of approximately $407 million, $394 million and $390 million, respectively, and amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of interest rate cap agreements of approximately $24 million, $20 million, and $18 million, respectively. the increase in debt expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in our average interest rate, partially offset by a decrease in our average outstanding balance. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2017 was 4.70% as compared to 4.43% in 2016.
85
the increase in debt expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to an increase in our weighted average outstanding principal balances as a result of a full year of interest on our 5.0% senior notes, which were issued in april 2015, and an increase in our interest rate on the amortization of our cap agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2016 was 4.43% as compared to 4.42% in 2015.
corporate administrative support. corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. this is partially offset by internal management fees charged to our other lines of business for that support.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $45 million in 2017 and $14 million 2016. corporate administrative support costs increased $31 million due to a decrease in internal management fees charged to our ancillary lines of business and increases in long-term incentive compensation and labor and benefits expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $14 million in 2016 and $19 million in 2015. corporate administrative support costs decreased $5 million primarily attributable to a decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense, primarily due to reductions in ultimate expected pay-outs as well as the departure of a senior executive, partially offset by increases in labor and benefits, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses.
other income. other income was approximately $18 million in 2017 and $8 million in both 2016 and 2015, and consisted principally of interest income. other income in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased approximately $10 million, primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses. other income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was flat, as short-term investment interest income increased but was offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 23.1%, 26.6% and 30.1% of income from continuing operations, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2017 was lower primarily due to the enactment of new u.s. federal tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 tax act) as signed into law on december 22, 2017. the 2017 tax act, among other changes, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, resulting in a net income net tax benefit of $252 million in 2017 primarily related to a remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability. excluding this item, our effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 was 41.1%. the effective tax rate in 2016 was lower primarily due to the gain on the apac jv ownership changes, offset by goodwill impairment charges. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $167 million, $153 million and $158 million, respectively. the increase in noncontrolling interests in 2017 was primarily due to additional income to noncontrolling interests related to the net gain on the settlement with the va of $24 million, partially offset by the impairment of our vascular access reporting unit, which reduced income to noncontrolling interests by $2 million year over year.
the decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of our vascular access reporting unit, which resulted in a decrease in income to noncontrolling interest of $8 million. the percentage of net u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues generated from dialysis-related joint ventures was approximately 24% in 2017, and 23% in both 2016 and 2015.
accounts receivable our consolidated accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 were $1.715 billion and $1.504 billion, respectively, representing approximately 57 days and 52 days of revenue, respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the increase in consolidated dso was primarily related to our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business and was due to changes we made in our collection policies and procedures to improve overall collections. we expect dso to decline two to three days over the next few quarters as we continue to adjust and refine our collection operations for these new protocols. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day. there were no significant changes during 2017 from 2016 in the amount of unreserved accounts receivable over one year old or the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our net patient services accounts receivable balances more than six months old represents approximately 21% and 16% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances, respectively. the increase was primarily
86
due to changes we made in our collection policies and procedures to improve overall collections. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. approximately 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $104 million and $105 million, respectively, and are classified as other receivables. currently, a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. however, payments received from medicare are subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of these audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity. as of december 31, 2017, our cash balance was $508 million and we also had approximately $44 million in short-term investments. we had $300 million drawn on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities, in addition to the approximately $14 million committed for outstanding letters of credit. we also have approximately $90 million of additional outstanding letters of credit related to kidney care and $0.2 million of committed outstanding letters of credit related to dmg, which is backed by a certificate of deposit. we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service payments and other obligations for the foreseeable future. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
consolidated cash flows from operations during 2017 was $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion was from continuing operations, compared with consolidated cash flows from operations of $2.0 billion for 2016, of which $1.7 billion was from continuing operations. consolidated cash flows declined due to an increase in dso and the timing of other working capital items, partially offset by the payment received from the settlement with the va, net of associated tax payments. cash flows from operations in 2017 included cash interest payments of approximately $425 million and cash tax payments of $387 million. cash flows from operations in 2016 included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of $339 million.
non-operating cash outflows in 2017 included $905 million for capital asset expenditures, including $559 million for new center developments and relocations and $346 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $804 million for acquisitions. in addition, during 2017 we received $21 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $211 million, which included $24 million related to the noncontrolling interest portion of the va settlement gain, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $75 million associated with new or existing joint ventures. we also repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares of our common stock for $811 million, or an average price of $62.54 per share, of which $8 million was unsettled at december 31, 2017.
consolidated cash flows from operations during 2016 was $2.0 billion, of which $1.7 billion was from continuing operations, compared with cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion for 2015, of which $1.2 billion was from continuing operations. the increase in our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to payments of $494 million, or $304 million after-tax, made in connection with the settlement of a private civil suit in 2015 and the timing of other working capital items, offset by an increase in our income tax payments and a slight increase in our cash interest payments. cash flows from operations in 2016 included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of $339 million. cash flows from operations in 2015 included cash interest payments of approximately $405 million and cash tax payments of $156 million.
non-operating cash outflows in 2016 included $829 million for capital asset expenditures, including $470 million for new center developments and relocations and $359 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $564 million for acquisitions. during 2016, we also received $1.3 billion from the maturity and sale of investments, however these proceeds were principally used to repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2016 we received $37 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $192 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $48 million associated with new or existing joint ventures. we also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion, or an average price of $64.41 per share. in addition, we settled $25 million in share repurchases related to 2015.
during 2017, in the u.s. we opened 121 dialysis centers, acquired 66 dialysis centers, including dialysis centers from the renal ventures acquisition, closed and merged ten dialysis centers, closed nine dialysis centers, divested six dialysis centers, deconsolidated seven dialysis centers which we continue to operate under management services agreements, and terminated two management services agreements. in addition, our international dialysis operations acquired 68 dialysis centers,
87
opened eight dialysis centers, and closed one dialysis center. in addition, our apac jv acquired two dialysis centers, opened nine dialysis centers and closed three dialysis centers.
during 2017, our dmg business acquired four primary care physician practices, including the acquisition of magan, seven private medical practices, and one independent physician association.
on december 5, 2017, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our dmg division to optum, a subsidiary of unitedhealth group inc., for $4.9 billion in cash, subject to net working capital and other customary adjustments. the transaction is expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
during 2016, in the u.s. we opened 100 new dialysis centers, acquired a total of eight dialysis centers, closed and merged five centers, added two centers which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement, terminated two management and administration services agreements, deconsolidated three centers which we now operate under management and administrative services agreements and closed four centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers and opened 12 new dialysis and hospital operated centers. in addition, our apac jv acquired three dialysis and hospital operated centers.
during 2016, our dmg business acquired three primary care physician practices including the acquisition of tec, and four private medical practices.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $88 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $63 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b.
interest rate cap agreements as of december 31, 2017, we maintain several currently effective interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in november 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these cap agreements became effective september 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2018. as of december 31, 2017, these cap agreements had an immaterial fair value. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized debt expense of $8.3 million from these caps. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $0.1 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
as of december 31, 2017, we also maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in october 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these forward cap agreements will become effective june 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of its debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2020. as of december 31, 2017, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $1.0 million. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $8.8 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
other items as of december 31, 2017, our term loan b debt bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 2.75%. term loan b is subject to interest rate caps if libor should rise above 3.50%. term loan a bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 2.00%. the capped portion of term loan a is $122.5 million. in addition, the uncapped portion of term loan a, which is subject to the variability of libor, is $652.5 million. interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 4.45%, based on the current margins in effect of 2.00% for term loan a and the revolver and 2.75% for term loan b, as of december 31, 2017.
as of december 31, 2017, our interest rates are fixed on approximately 52% of our total debt.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2017 was 4.70% and as of december 31, 2017 was 4.88%.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $300 million drawn on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities, in addition to approximately $14.4 million committed for outstanding letters of credit. we also have approximately $90.1 million of additional outstanding letters of credit related to kidney care and $0.2 million of committed outstanding letters of credit related to dmg, which is backed by a certificate of deposit.

we believe that we will generate significant operating cash flows and will have sufficient liquidity to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months, under the terms of our debt agreements. however, our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, including general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in the risk factor in item ia risk factors under the heading "the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control."
goodwill we elected to early adopt asu no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, effective january 1, 2017. the amendments in this asu simplify the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating the second step in the assessment. all goodwill impairment tests performed during 2017 have been performed under this new guidance.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit as a result of changes in future governmental reimbursement rates for this business and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of $35 million at our vascular access reporting unit. this charge resulted primarily from continuing changes in our outlook for this business unit as our partners and operators continued to evaluate and make decisions concerning changes in operations, including termination of their management services agreements and center closures, as a result of the changes in reimbursement structure discussed above. as of december 31, 2017, there was no goodwill remaining at our vascular access reporting unit.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we also performed annual impairment assessments for various other reporting units. as a result of these assessments, we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $2 million at one of our international reporting units during the year ended december 31, 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million in another international reporting unit.
based on our most recent assessments, we determined that reductions in reimbursement rates, changes in actual or expected growth rates, or other significant adverse changes in expected future cash flows or valuation assumptions could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future for the following reporting units, which remain at risk of goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2017:

(2)   potential impact on estimated fair value of a sustained, long-term reduction of 3% in operating income as of the latest assessment date.
(3)   potential impact on estimated fair value of an increase in discount rates of 100 basis points as of the latest assessment date.
there were no major changes in the business, prospects, or expected future results of these reporting units from their latest assessment date through december 31, 2017.
except as described above, none of our various other reporting units was considered at risk of significant goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2017. since the dates of our last annual goodwill impairment tests, there have been certain developments, events, changes in operating performance and other changes in key circumstances that have affected our businesses. however, except as further described above, these did not cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units would be less than their respective carrying amounts as of december 31, 2017.

long-term incentive compensation long-term incentive program (ltip) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term performance-based cash awards. long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general and administrative in nature, was attributed among our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.
our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
during 2017, we granted approximately 1,692,154 stock-settled stock appreciation rights (ssars) with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $24.5 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.2 years and approximately 528,968 stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $34.8 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.4 years. we also granted 15,000 cash-settled stock-based awards with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $0.3 million.
for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, long-term incentive compensation expense of $62.0 million and $65.0 million decreased by approximately $3.0 million and $59.0 million as compared to 2016 and 2015, respectively. this decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense was primarily due to cumulative revaluation of liability-based awards for reductions in estimated ultimate payouts, as well as the final vesting of a prior broad grant that is no longer contributing expense.
as of december 31, 2017, there was $98.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term incentive compensation expense for ltip awards outstanding, including $61.2 million relating to stock-based awards under our equity compensation plans. we expect to recognize the performance-based cash component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.1 years and the stock-based component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years.
for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received $13.5 million, $28.4 million and $45.7 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. since we issue stock-settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, we did not receive cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
stock repurchases we repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares for $811 million, or an average price of $62.54 during the year ended december 31, 2017. we also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares for $1.1 billion, or an average price of $64.41 during the year ended december 31, 2016 and a total of 7,779,958 shares for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 during the year ended december 31, 2015. subsequent to december 31, 2017, we have repurchased 1,237,800 additional shares of our common stock for $93 million, or an average price of $74.96 per share, through february 22, 2018.
on october 10, 2017, our board of directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization in the amount of $1.3 billion. this share repurchase authorization was in addition to the $247 million remaining at that time under our board of directors' prior share repurchase authorization announced in july 2016. accordingly, as of february 22, 2018, we have a total of $1.0 billion available under the current board repurchase authorizations for additional share repurchases. although these share repurchase authorizations do not have expiration dates, we remain subject to share repurchase limitations under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. substantially all of our u.s. dialysis facilities are leased. we have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in several of our majority-owned joint ventures and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third-party owners' equity interests at either the appraised fair market value or
90
a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flows attributable to the equity interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. the methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions are a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests. the amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties or centers in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management and administrative services agreements.
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2017:
less than 1 year                 1-3                 4-5                after               total years               years              5 years

in 2010, we entered into and subsequently extended an agreement with fmc to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from fmc through december 31, 2017. in january 2018, we entered into a new agreement extending this agreement with fmc through december 31, 2020. the actual amount of purchases in future years from fmc will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, and growth of our existing centers.
we are party to agreements with baxter healthcare corporation (baxter) that commit us to purchase a certain amount of hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices through 2018. in addition, in february 2018 we amended our agreement with baxter related to certain peritoneal dialysis supplies. under this new contract with baxter we have committed to purchase a certain amount of peritoneal dialysis supplies at fixed prices (as set forth in the contract for each year) through 2022.

in january 2017, we entered into a sourcing and supply agreement with amgen usa inc. (amgen) that expires on december 31, 2022. under the terms of the agreement, we will purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for esas through the expiration of the contract. the actual amount of epo that we will purchase will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.
settlements of approximately $33 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
supplemental information concerning certain physician groups and unrestricted subsidiaries the following information is presented as supplemental data as required by the indentures governing our senior notes.
we provide services to certain physician groups, including those within our dmg business, which while consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, are not subsidiaries of or owned by us, do not constitute "subsidiaries" as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and do not guarantee those senior notes. in addition, we have entered into management agreements with these physician groups pursuant to which we receive management fees from the physician groups.
as of december 31, 2017, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our consolidated assets would have been approximately $18.522 billion and our consolidated other liabilities would have been approximately $3.342 billion. our consolidated indebtedness would have remained approximately $9.400 billion due to these physician groups being classified as held for sale. for the year ended december 31, 2017, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our consolidated net income would have been reduced by approximately $21 million. our consolidated total net revenues and consolidated operating income would have remained approximately $10.877 billion and $1.813 billion, respectively, due to these physician groups being reported as discontinued operations.
in addition, our dmg business owns a 67% equity interest in california medical group insurance (cmgi), which is an unrestricted subsidiary as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and does not guarantee those senior notes. dmg's equity interest in cmgi is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, meaning that, although cmgi is not consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, our consolidated income statement reflects our pro rata share of cmgi's net income within net loss from discontinued operations.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, excluding dmg's equity investment income attributable to cmgi, our consolidated net income would be decreased by approximately $19 thousand. see note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
contingencies the information in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill and investments, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, consolidation of variable interest entities, and fair value estimates are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial
92
healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, a slowdown in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 197,800 u.s. dialysis patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect the range of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 5% of u.s. dialysis and related lab services' adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
laboratory service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
impairments of goodwill and investments. we account for impairments of goodwill and equity method and other investments in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment when changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. equity method and other investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when changes in circumstances warrant. an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded when the fair value of an investment has fallen below its carrying amount and the shortfall is expected to be indefinitely or permanently unrecoverable.
such changes can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market, business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure, operating performance, future prospects, relationships with partners, and/or market value indications for the subject business. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning the subject businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. any change in the factors, assessments or assumptions involved could impact a determination of whether and when to assess goodwill or an investment for impairment as well as the outcome of such an assessment. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. the actual impact of any such laws or regulations, including the 2017 tax act, could be materially different from our current estimates.

significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations, assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
variable compensation accruals. we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate-specific and/or corporate financial and operating goals. our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses and other awards, including long-term incentive programs, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final payment amount. actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and/or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors, as applicable.
consolidation of variable interest entities. we rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do not directly own or control, but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the primary beneficiary. under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities, we have determined that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements. the analyses upon which these determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement. while these determinations have a meaningful effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements, non-consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.
fair value estimates. we rely on fair value measurements and estimates for purposes that require the recording, reassessment, or adjustment of the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest subject to put provisions (temporary equity). these purposes can include the accounting for business combination transactions, impairment assessments for goodwill, investments, or other long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation, among others. the criticality of a particular fair value estimate to our consolidated financial statements depends upon the nature and size of the item being measured and the extent of uncertainties involved and the nature and magnitude or potential effect of assumptions and judgments required. critical fair value estimates can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
the fasb defines fair value as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. critical fair value estimates can be required for measurement of goodwill and equity method and other investment impairments, as discussed previously. fair value estimates can also be critical in accounting for major acquisitions or business combination transactions of significant size involving businesses or industries in which we and/or our professional valuation advisors do not have significant experience. in these cases, the nature and size of the item being measured and the extent of uncertainties involved, as well as the nature and magnitude or potential effect of assumptions and judgments required, can make the fair value estimate a critical accounting estimate.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent financial accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb.

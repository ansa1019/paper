our net income of $2.0 billion for 2017 includes charges totaling $1.8 billion related to the enactment of the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017. see "md&a-income taxes" below for additional information.
our common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, including transition provisions, was 10.3% and 10.1% as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. see "md&a-capital management" below for additional information.
on june 28, 2017, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018. in december 2017, the board of directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remaining 2017 ccar period, which ends june 30, 2018 ("2017 stock repurchase program"). see "md&a-capital management-dividend policy and stock purchases" for additional information.
below are additional highlights of our performance in 2017. these highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2017 and 2016, except as otherwise noted. the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2017 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2016. we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this "executive summary and business outlook."

total company performance
•   earnings: our net income decreased by $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily driven by:
◦   higher income tax provision due to charges associated with the estimated impacts of the tax act;
◦   higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio;
◦   higher operating expenses as a result of (i) loan growth; (ii) continued investments in technology and infrastructure; and (iii) restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations; and
◦   higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities.
these drivers were partially offset by higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, as well as higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.
•   loans held for investment:
◦   period-end loans held for investment increased by $8.9 billion to $254.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, largely driven by loans obtained in the cabela's acquisition, as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
◦   average loans held for investment increased by $12.3 billion to $245.6 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by growth in our auto, domestic credit card and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: our net charge-off rate increased by 50 basis points to 2.67% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations.
our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 21 basis points to 3.48% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to:
◦   higher auto delinquency inventories; and
◦   growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations.
we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under "md&a-business segment financial performance" and "md&a -credit risk profile."
•   allowance for loan and lease losses: our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $999 million to $7.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 30 basis points to 2.95% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016. the increases were primarily driven by:
◦   an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning; and
◦   an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher losses associated with growth.
these drivers were partially offset by an allowance decrease in our commercial loan portfolio primarily driven by charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio, as well as reduced exposure and improved credit risk ratings in our oil and gas portfolio.

business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this report. the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in "part i-item 1. business" and "part ii-item 7. md&a" of this report. certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:
•   any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies;
•   the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or
•   any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.
see "part i-item 1. business-forward-looking statements" in this report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this report and "part i-item 1a. risk factors" in this report for factors that could materially influence our results.
total company expectations we expect that our current trajectory, coupled with the tax act, will enable us to accelerate 2018 earnings per share growth, excluding adjusting items and assuming no substantial change in the broader economic or credit cycles.
we expect that a majority of the benefit from the tax act will be reflected in our earnings in the near term. over time, we expect that marketplace dynamics will consume a portion of the benefit through increasing competition, including higher levels of marketing, lower prices and higher wages, and we expect that these market effects will increase over time.
we expect our annual effective income tax rate to be around 19% in 2018, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility.
we expect that marketing expense in 2018 will be higher than 2017.
while our efficiency ratio may vary in any given year, over the long term, we believe that we will be able to achieve gradual improvement in our efficiency ratio driven by growth and digital productivity gains.
we believe that our common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis will trend toward the mid-10% range by the end of 2018.
on june 28, 2017, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018 as part of the 2017 stock repurchase program. in december 2017, the board of directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remaining 2017 ccar period, which ends june 30, 2018. the timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position, the amount of retained earnings and utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. see "md&a-capital management-dividend policy and stock purchases" for more information.
we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and returns, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval and market conditions.
business segment expectations credit card: in our domestic card business, we expect that the upward pressure on charge-offs as new loans season and become a larger portion of our overall portfolio will continue to moderate, with a small impact in 2018. as the impact of new loan seasoning moderates, we expect that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors.
consumer banking: in our consumer banking business, we expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually and the growth we have experienced in that business will moderate.

consolidated results of operations the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2017 and 2016. we provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, "md&a-business segment financial performance." you should read this section together with our "md&a-executive summary and business outlook," where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. we expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(1)   past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(2)   some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications to present interest income and yields from our commercial banking business on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate (35% for all periods presented), with offsetting reductions to the other category. taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our commercial banking loans totaled approximately $129 million, $126 million and $102 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with corresponding reductions to other.
(3)   interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.

net interest income increased by $1.6 billion to $22.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. net interest margin increased by 19 basis points to 6.97% in 2017 compared to 2016. these increases were primarily driven by:
•   growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios; and
•   higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.
these drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities.
net interest income increased by $2.0 billion to $20.9 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the hfs acquisition; and
•   higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.
net interest margin increased by 12 basis points to 6.78% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   continued growth in our credit card loan portfolio; and
•   continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
this increase was partially offset by:
•   the impact of loans acquired from the hfs acquisition, which generally have lower net interest margins compared to our total company portfolio; and
•   margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.

__________
(1)   we calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. when the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.
(2)   some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications to present interest income and yields from our commercial banking business on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate (35% for all periods presented), with offsetting reductions to the other category.

non-interest income increased by $149 million to $4.8 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to:
•   an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume; and
•   gains from the sale of investment securities as a result of portfolio repositioning.
non-interest income increased by $49 million to $4.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume in our credit card business, net of rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and
•   higher revenue attributable to our multifamily business in our commercial banking business.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our domestic card business during the first quarter of 2016.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $7.6 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.5 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 33.6%, 30.9% and 24.1% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
our provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by:
•   higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and
•   higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to growth.
these drivers were partially offset by lower provision in our commercial banking loan portfolio primarily driven by stabilizing industry conditions impacting our oil and gas lending portfolio compared to adverse industry conditions in the prior year.
our provision for credit losses increased by $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by:
•   higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning;
•   higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios; and
•   higher allowance in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts.
we provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within "md&a-credit risk profile," "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments." for information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."

non-interest expense increased by $636 million to $14.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to:
•   higher operating expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure; and
•   restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower marketing expenses; and
•   lower amortization of intangibles.
non-interest expense increased by $562 million to $13.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to:
•   higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure;

•   higher bank optimization charges; and
•   higher fdic surcharges and premiums.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax income (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, greenpoint mortgage funding, inc. ("greenpoint") and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of greenpoint credit, llc, a subsidiary of greenpoint, both of which were acquired as part of the north fork bancorporation, inc. ("north fork") acquisition in december 2006. loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $135 million in 2017, primarily driven by a mortgage representation and warranty settlement in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to loss of $19 million in 2016 and income of $38 million in 2015.
we provide additional information on discontinued operations in "note 2-business developments and discontinued operations" and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-mortgage representation and warranty reserve" and "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
income taxes we recorded income tax provision of $3.4 billion (61.5% effective income tax rate) in 2017, which includes charges of $1.8 billion associated with the estimated impacts of the tax act. the estimated impacts of the tax act consist of:
•   $1.6 billion due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets reflecting the reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%;
•   $125 million related to the deemed repatriation of our undistributed foreign earnings; and
•   $76 million associated with the revaluation of our investments in affordable housing projects.
the impacts of the tax act are considered to be reasonable estimates that are provisional in nature and are subject to potential adjustment during the measurement period ending no later than december 2018. see "md&a-accounting changes and developments" for more information on the accounting for the impacts of the tax act.
we recorded income tax provisions of $1.7 billion (31.3% effective income tax rate) and $1.9 billion (31.8% effective income tax rate) in 2016 and 2015, respectively. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.
the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to charges of $1.8 billion associated with the impacts of the tax act, partially offset by a relative increase in the amount of tax credits and tax-exempt income.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower income before taxes and increased tax credits. this decrease was partially offset by reduced discrete tax benefits and a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings.
we recorded total discrete tax expense of $1.7 billion in 2017, primarily consisting of the charges of $1.8 billion for the estimated impacts of the tax act, and discrete tax benefits of $2 million and $15 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items, was 29.9%, 31.3% and 32.0% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in "note 16-income taxes."
consolidated balance sheets analysis total assets increased by $8.7 billion to $365.7 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in loans held for investment primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, largely driven by loans obtained in the cabela's acquisition, as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
total liabilities increased by $7.4 billion to $317.0 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily driven by:
•   an increase in our senior and subordinated notes; and
•   an increase in our deposits.
these drivers were partially offset by a decrease in our federal home loan banks ("fhlb") advances outstanding, which is included in other debt.
49      capital one financial corporation (cof)
stockholders' equity increased by $1.2 billion to $48.7 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to our net income of $2.0 billion in 2017, partially offset by $1.0 billion of dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders.
the following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2017. period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing the liquidity requirements of the company, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.
investment securities our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: u.s. treasury securities; u.s. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ("agency") and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs"); agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"); other asset-backed securities ("abs"); and other securities. agency securities include government national mortgage association ("ginnie mae") guaranteed securities, federal national mortgage association ("fannie mae") and federal home loan mortgage corporation ("freddie mac") issued securities. the carrying value of our investments in u.s. treasury and agency securities represented 95% and 91% of our total investment securities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $37.7 billion as of december 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.1 billion from december 31, 2016. the decrease in fair value was primarily due to the sale of investment securities as a result of portfolio repositioning. the fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was $29.4 billion as of december 31, 2017, an increase of $3.2 billion from december 31, 2016. the increase in fair value was primarily driven by purchases outpacing paydowns.

credit ratings our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the u.s. treasury and agencies. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 96% and 95% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated aa+ or its equivalent, or better, respectively, while approximately 3% and 4% was below investment grade, respectively. we categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lower of credit ratings issued by standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's").
table 6 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency rmbs, non-agency cmbs, other abs and other securities in our portfolio as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. we sold all of our non-agency cmbs during 2017.

loans held for investment increased by $8.9 billion to $254.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, largely driven by loans obtained in the cabela's acquisition, as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.

securitized debt obligations securitized debt obligations increased to $20.0 billion as of december 31, 2017 from $18.8 billion as of december 31, 2016 primarily driven by securitized debt obligations assumed in the cabela's acquisition, partially offset by maturities outpacing issuances. we provide additional information on our borrowings in "md&a-liquidity risk profile" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
other debt other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and fhlb advances, totaled $40.3 billion as of december 31, 2017, of which $39.7 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. other debt totaled $41.6 billion as of december 31, 2016, of which $40.6 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings.
the decrease in other debt of $1.4 billion in 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in our fhlb advances outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes. we provide additional information on our borrowings in "md&a-liquidity risk profile" and in "note 9-deposits and borrowings."
mortgage representation and warranty reserve we face residual exposure related to subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. we establish representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. these reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. as a result of resolutions and settlements of the substantial majority of our active representation and warranty matters in 2017, our reserve was immaterial as of december 31, 2017. see "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" for additional information.
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.4 billion from december 31, 2016. the decrease in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by the revaluation reflecting the reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, as a result of the tax act. the impacts of the tax act are considered to be reasonable estimates that are provisional in nature and are subject to potential adjustment during the measurement period ending no later than december 2018. see "md&a-accounting changes and developments" for more information on the accounting for the impacts of the tax act.
we have recorded valuation allowances of $226 million and $179 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in valuation allowance was primarily driven by the reduction in federal income tax rate as a result of the tax act. we expect to fully realize the 2017 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
we provide additional information on income taxes in "md&a-consolidated results of operations" and in "note 16-income taxes."

off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. these activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("vies") as well as other arrangements, such as letter of credits, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. we provide additional information regarding these types of activities in "note 6-variable interest entities and securitizations" and "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
business segment financial performance our principal operations are organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group, are included in the other category.
the results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market interest rates. our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. we regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our "managed" presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on u.s. gaap. there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to u.s. gaap; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. in addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.
below we summarize our business segment results, changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as a comparative discussion of these results. we provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in "note 18-business segments."

(1)   total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.
(2)   net income (loss) for our business segments and the other category is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax.
(3)   some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate (35% for all periods presented), with offsetting reductions to the other category.
credit card business the primary sources of revenue for our credit card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.
our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.9 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. total net revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $732 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees and related losses. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $491 million and $402 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
54      capital one financial corporation (cof)
(3)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(4)   total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale.
(5)   purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
(6)   within our credit card loan portfolio, only certain loans in our international card businesses are classified as nonperforming. see "md&amp;a-nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets" for additional information.
key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2017 compared to 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $1.0 billion to $13.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was substantially flat at $3.3 billion in 2017 primarily driven by:
◦   lower service charges and other customer-related fees, including the impact of the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our domestic card business during the first quarter of 2016; and
◦   the absence of a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in visa europe with visa inc. as a result of visa inc.'s acquisition of visa europe.
these drivers were largely offset by an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion to $6.1 billion in 2017 primarily driven by:
◦   higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and
◦   a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $213 million to $7.9 billion in 2017, primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure.
this driver was partially offset by:
◦   lower marketing expenses;
◦   lower amortization of intangibles; and
◦   operating efficiencies.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $9.2 billion to $114.8 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to:
◦   growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, largely driven by loans obtained in the cabela's acquisition; and
◦   the impact of foreign exchange rates in our international card businesses driven by the weakening of the u.s. dollar in 2017.
average loans held for investment increased by $6.9 billion to $103.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic card business.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 79 basis points to 4.88% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 5 basis points to 3.99% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations, partially offset by loans obtained in the cabela's acquisition.

key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $1.5 billion to $12.6 billion in 2016 primarily driven by loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was flat at $3.4 billion in 2016 as an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume was largely offset by:
◦   higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and
◦   lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our domestic card business during the first quarter of 2016.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $1.5 billion to $4.9 billion in 2016 primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $201 million to $7.7 billion in 2016 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continued investments in technology, partially offset by operating efficiencies.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $9.4 billion to $105.6 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and average loans held for investment increased by $9.8 billion to $96.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, both primarily due to continued loan growth in our domestic card business.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 73 basis points to 4.09% in 2016 compared to 2015, and the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 54 basis points to 3.94% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015. these increases were primarily driven by growth and seasoning of credit card loan originations, partially offset by continued growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio.
domestic card business domestic card generated net income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in 2017, 2016 and 2015, domestic card accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our credit card business.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs.
(2)   period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.
(3)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(4)   total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.
(5)   purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
because our domestic card business accounts for the substantial majority of our credit card business, the key factors driving the results are similar to the key factors affecting our total credit card business. net income for our domestic card business decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by:
•   higher provision for credit losses; and
•   higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure.
these drivers were partially offset by:
•   higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth;
•   lower marketing expenses; and
•   operating efficiencies.

(1)   average consumer banking loans held for investment includes purchased credit-impaired loans ("pci loans") of $12.2 billion, $16.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. period-end consumer banking loans held for investment includes pci loans with carrying values of $10.3 billion and $14.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(2)   average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
(3)   nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, real estate owned ("reo") and other foreclosed assets. the total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, reo and other foreclosed assets.
(4)   excluding the impact of the pci loan amounts in footnote 1 above, the allowance coverage ratio for our total consumer banking portfolio was 1.87% and 1.83% as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(5)   loans serviced for others represents loans serviced for third parties related to our consumer home loan business.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2017 compared to 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $551 million to $6.4 billion in 2017 primarily driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio and higher deposit volumes and margins in our retail banking business.
consumer banking loan yield increased by 33 basis points to 6.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily driven by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was substantially flat at $749 million in 2017 as a mortgage representation and warranty reserve release in the first quarter of 2017 had a similar impact as the customer rewards reserve release within our retail banking business in the first quarter of 2016 related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $125 million to $1.2 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher losses in our auto loan portfolio due to growth.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $94 million to $4.2 billion in 2017 primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio and continued investment in technology and infrastructure, partially offset by operating efficiencies.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.0 billion to $75.1 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016, and average loans held for investment increased by $3.2 billion to $74.6 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. these increases were due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $3.9 billion to $185.8 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 24 basis points to 1.39% in 2017 compared to 2016. this increase was primarily driven by:
◦   higher losses in our auto loan portfolio due to changes in our charge-off practices for certain bankrupt accounts and growth; and
◦   a greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio.
the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 67 basis points to 5.34% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily attributable to higher auto delinquency inventories.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income was flat at $5.8 billion in 2016 as growth in our auto loan portfolio was offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.
60      capital one financial corporation (cof)
◦   consumer banking loan yield increased by 8 basis points to 6.3% in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by declining yield in our auto loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income was substantially flat at $733 million in 2016.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $236 million to $1.1 billion in 2016 primarily driven by:
◦   a higher allowance in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, increasing loss expectations on recent originations and a build reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts; and
◦   higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to seasoning of recent growth.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $113 million to $4.1 billion in 2016 primarily due to:
◦   higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio; and
◦   higher marketing expenses.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.7 billion to $73.1 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015, and average loans held for investment increased by $272 million to $71.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. the increases were primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $9.2 billion to $181.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 as a result of strong growth in our deposit products that are sold directly to both existing and new customers.
•   net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 12 basis points to 1.15% in 2016 compared to 2015. the increase reflects the greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio. the 30+ day delinquency rate was flat at 4.67% as of both december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
commercial banking business the primary sources of revenue for our commercial banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. because our commercial banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.
our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $676 million, $575 million and $570 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2017 compared to 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income was substantially flat at $2.3 billion in 2017.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $130 million to $708 million in 2017 primarily driven by:
◦   higher revenue from our commercial investments that generate tax credits; and
◦   higher service charges and other customer-related fees as a result of increased activity across a broad range of products and services provided to our commercial customers.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses decreased by $182 million to $301 million in 2017 primarily driven by stabilizing industry conditions impacting our oil and gas lending portfolio compared to adverse industry conditions in the prior year.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $196 million to $1.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with growth and continued investments in technology and other business initiatives.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment decreased by $2.3 billion to $64.6 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to:
◦paydowns in our commercial and industrial loan portfolios;
◦charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio; and
◦   the transfer of the substantial majority of our remaining taxi medallion lending portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.
average loans held for investment increased by $2.2 billion to $67.4 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios.
•   deposits: period-end deposits were substantially flat at $33.9 billion as of december 31, 2017.
•   net charge-off and nonperforming metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 24 basis points to 0.69% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by higher charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio resulting from declines in taxi medallion values.
the nonperforming loan rate decreased by 109 basis points to 0.44% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016 primarily due to:
◦   a combination of improved credit risk ratings, charge-offs and paydowns in our oil and gas portfolio; and
◦   charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio resulting from declines in taxi medallion values and the impact of transferring the substantial majority of our remaining taxi medallion lending portfolio, which was downgraded to nonperforming classification in the third quarter of 2017, from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.
key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2016 compared to 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $351 million to $2.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by loan growth, including loans obtained in the hfs acquisition.
63      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $91 million to $578 million in 2016 primarily driven by fee-based services, including impacts from the hfs acquisition, and products attributable to our multifamily finance business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $181 million to $483 million in 2016 primarily driven by higher charge-offs, partially offset by a smaller allowance build, due to continued adverse industry conditions impacting our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $251 million to $1.4 billion in 2016 driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the hfs acquisition and continued growth in our commercial banking business.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $3.7 billion to $66.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015 driven by growth in our commercial loan portfolios. average loans held for investment increased by $12.5 billion to $65.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by the hfs acquisition and growth in our commercial loan portfolios.
•   deposits: period-end deposits decreased by $391 million to $33.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015.
•   net charge-off and nonperforming metrics: the net charge-off rate increased by 36 basis points to 0.45% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting rising losses in our taxi medallion and oil and gas lending portfolios. increased credit risk rating downgrades in these same lending portfolios resulted in the nonperforming loan rate increasing by 66 basis points to 1.53% as of december 31, 2016 from december 31, 2015.
other category other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized corporate treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities. other also includes:
•   foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances;
•   unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges;
•   offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications; and
•   residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments.

net loss from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $1.6 billion in 2017 compared to net income of $165 million in 2016. the loss in 2017 was primarily driven by:
•   charges associated with the estimated impacts of the tax act; and
•   higher operating expenses associated with restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations, as well as the realignment of resources supporting our businesses.
net income from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $165 million in 2016 compared to $54 million in 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by:
•   higher net interest income due to balance sheet growth, as well as the impact of rates on our other treasury-related activities; and
•   lower restructuring charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs as a result of the realignment of our workforce.
these drivers were partially offset by:
•   higher bank optimization charges and an impairment charge associated with certain acquired intangible and software assets within non-interest expense;
•   lower non-interest income due to rate-driven hedge ineffectiveness; and
•   a reduced income tax benefit as a result of higher income before taxes and increased discrete tax expense, partially offset by increased tax credits.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. these critical accounting policies govern:
•   loan loss reserves
•   asset impairment
•   fair value of financial instruments
•   customer rewards reserve we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment portfolios as of each balance sheet date. we also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
65      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses. our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $7.6 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.5 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. losses are inherent in our loan portfolios and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolios with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. the allowance totaled $7.5 billion as of december 31, 2017, compared to $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016.
we review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices and the valuation of commercial properties and other collateral, consumer real estate and automobiles.
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial banking business. changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies." we provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. total net revenue was reduced by $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $732 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $491 million as of december 31, 2017, compared to $402 million as of december 31, 2016.
we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. below we describe our process for assessing impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.
66      capital one financial corporation (cof)
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
goodwill totaled $14.5 billion as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016. intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ("pccr"), core deposit and other intangibles. the net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $421 million as of december 31, 2017, from $665 million as of december 31, 2016 primarily due to amortization. goodwill and intangible assets together represented 4% of our total assets as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016. we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2017, 2016 or 2015. see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october 1 at a reporting unit level. we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment may have occurred. in 2017, we had four reporting units: credit card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking.
the goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step is not necessary. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then the second step, which requires measurement of any potential impairment, must be performed. the second step of goodwill impairment testing requires an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit's balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance.
for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and intangibles balances. we then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholders' equity to assess the reasonableness of our methodology. the total carrying amount of our four reporting units was $43.6 billion, as compared to consolidated stockholder's equity of $50.2 billion as of october 1, 2017. the $6.6 billion excess in consolidated stockholder's equity was primarily attributable to capital allocated to our other category and other future capital needs such as dividends.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the associated assets, liabilities and intangible assets, is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. the fair value of the reporting units was calculated using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") calculation, a form of the income approach. this income approach calculation used projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. our dcf analysis requires management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. these cash flows and terminal values were then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. the reasonableness of the dcf approach was assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. the results of the 2017 annual impairment test for the credit card, auto, other consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of these four reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.
by definition, assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. a significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration in market conditions, adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment charge to earnings in a future period.
67      capital one financial corporation (cof)
intangible assets intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. an impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying amount. there was no meaningful impairment of intangible assets in 2017 or 2015. we recorded an impairment charge of $17 million in 2016 related primarily to our brokerage relationship intangibles.
see "note 7-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
fair value fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. the fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2: observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 3: unobservable inputs the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. if markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level 2 or level 3. in making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. if level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as level 3. the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in "note 17-fair value measurement."
fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.
groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information.
68      capital one financial corporation (cof)
our fair value committee ("fvc"), which includes representation from business areas, risk management and finance divisions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. the model risk office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance.
the fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee ("vac") for resolution. the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior management. the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes.
customer rewards reserve we offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards, that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise, based on account activity. the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. we use a weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average redemption cost have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all rewards earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. we recognized customer rewards expense of $3.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
accounting changes and developments in connection with the enactment of the tax act, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act to express the views of the staff of the sec's division of corporation finance regarding application of accounting standards codification topic 740, income taxes, ("topic 740") in the reporting period that includes the date the tax act was signed into law. this bulletin states that the financial statements which include the reporting period in which the tax act was signed into law, should reflect the income tax impacts of the tax act for which the accounting under topic 740 is complete. to the extent the accounting under topic 740 is not complete, but a reasonable estimate of the impacts can be determined, such an estimate should be included in the financial statements as a provisional amount. for any specific tax impacts for which a reasonable estimate cannot be determined, a provisional amount should not be reported and topic 740 should be applied using the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the tax act.
the bulletin sets forth a measurement period which begins in the reporting period that includes the date the tax act was signed into law and ends when the accounting under topic 740 is complete, subject to a maximum length of one year. during this measurement period, adjustments to provisional amounts may need to be reflected based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the date the tax act was signed into law that, if known, would have affected the income tax impacts initially reported as provisional. finally, the bulletin requires disclosures for any income tax impacts of the tax act that are accounted for under a measurement period approach.
69      capital one financial corporation (cof)
under this bulletin, we have determined that we are able to make reasonable estimates for certain effects of the tax act for the year ended december 31, 2017. accordingly, we have recognized provisional amounts for the impacts of the tax act based on these reasonable estimates. however, as of the date of this form 10-k, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the tax act as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the u.s. treasury department, internal revenue service, or other standard-setting bodies. we continue to assess information relating to these amounts, and with respect to the repatriation tax, we continue to assess its application in other jurisdictions. additionally, we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance, and accordingly, we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period ending no later than december 2018.
we provide the additional disclosures required by this bulletin in "note 16-income taxes."
see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on accounting standards adopted in 2017, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards.
capital management the level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. the level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
capital standards and prompt corrective action we are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve, office of the comptroller of the currency ("occ") and federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") (collectively, the "federal banking agencies"), including the capital rules that implemented the basel iii capital framework ("basel iii capital rule") developed by the basel committee on banking supervision ("basel committee"). moreover, the banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action ("pca") capital regulations.
in july 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted the basel iii capital rule, which, in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework, also implemented certain dodd-frank act and other capital provisions, and updated the pca capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. the basel iii capital rule amended both the basel i and basel ii advanced approaches frameworks, established a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. we refer to the amended basel i framework as the "basel iii standardized approach," and the amended advanced approaches framework as the "basel iii advanced approaches."
at the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. as a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the advanced approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. we entered parallel run under advanced approaches on january 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches, though we continue to use the standardized approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.
the basel iii capital rule also introduced the supplementary leverage ratio for all advanced approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including derivatives and unused commitments. given that we are in our basel iii advanced approaches parallel run, we calculate the ratio based on tier 1 capital under the standardized approach. the minimum requirement for the supplementary leverage ratio became effective as of january 1, 2018. as an advanced approaches banking organization, however, we were required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
the market risk rule supplements both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches by requiring institutions subject to the market risk rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. the market risk rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10%
70      capital one financial corporation (cof)
or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. as of december 31, 2017, the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule. see "md&a-market risk profile" below for additional information.
in october 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed certain limited changes to the basel iii capital rule. there is uncertainty regarding how any of the proposed changes may impact the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches. additionally, in december 2017, the basel committee finalized certain modifications to the international basel iii capital standards, which would require rulemaking in the united states prior to becoming effective for united states banking organizations. there is uncertainty around which of those changes may be adopted in the united states and how those changes may impact the u.s. capital framework.

__________
(1)   capital ratios are calculated based on the basel iii standardized approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. the inclusion of aoci and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.
(2)   common equity tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(3)   tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(4)   total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
(5)   tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.
(6)   supplementary leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.
the company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under pca requirements as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016.
71      capital one financial corporation (cof)
the basel iii capital rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity tier 1 capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios. the capital conservation buffer is being phased in over a transition period that commenced on january 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in on january 1, 2019. the capital conservation buffer was 1.25% in 2017.
for banks subject to the advanced approaches, including the company and the banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% (once fully phased-in) composed of common equity tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the federal banking agencies. as of december 31, 2017, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero percent in the united states. a determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the federal banking agencies set an earlier effective date. the countercyclical capital buffer, if set to an amount greater than zero percent, would be subject to the same transition period as the capital conservation buffer, which commenced on january 1, 2016.
for 2017, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively, for the company and the banks. a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank's ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. as of december 31, 2017, the company and each of the banks were all above the applicable combined thresholds.
additionally, banks designated as global systemically important banks ("g-sibs") are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the basel iii capital rule. we are currently not designated as a g-sib and therefore not subject to this surcharge.
the following table compares our common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2017, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for advanced approaches banks such as ourselves that have not yet exited parallel run. our estimated common equity tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets and common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach are non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide useful information in evaluating compliance with regulatory capital requirements that are not effective yet. they are calculated based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. as we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation.

(1)   includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(2)   adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. the adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.
(3)   estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio is calculated by dividing estimated common equity tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for advanced approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.

under the basel iii capital rule, when we complete our parallel run for the advanced approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information. once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the basel iii capital rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the basel iii capital rule, will be deducted from our basel iii standardized approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our basel iii advanced approaches ratios will be lower than our basel iii standardized approach ratios. however, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the united states capital rules.
capital planning and regulatory stress testing on june 28, 2017, the federal reserve completed its 2017 ccar and did not object to our proposed capital plan. as a result, in june 2017, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018 and the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. as a condition to not objecting to the capital plan, the federal reserve required us to submit a revised capital plan by december 28, 2017 to address certain weaknesses it identified in our capital planning process. on december 24, 2017, using data as of june 30, 2017, we resubmitted our capital plan for the 2017 ccar process. in connection with the resubmission, the board of directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remaining 2017 ccar period, which ends june 30, 2018. if the federal reserve objects to the resubmitted capital plan, it may restrict subsequent capital distributions.
dividend policy and stock purchases on february 1, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on february 23, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of the business on february 12, 2018. our board of directors also approved quarterly dividends on our 6.00% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series b ("series b preferred stock"), our 6.25% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series c ("series c preferred stock"), our 6.70% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series d ("series d preferred stock"), our 6.20% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series f ("series f preferred stock"), our 5.20% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series g ("series g preferred stock") and our 6.00% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series h ("series h preferred stock"), payable on march 1, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 14, 2018. based on those declarations, we will pay approximately $196 million in common equity dividends and approximately $52 million in total preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2018. under the terms of our outstanding preferred stock, our ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that we do not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.
we paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in each quarter of 2017. the following table summarizes the dividends paid per share on our various preferred stock series in each quarter of 2017.

non-cumulative the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. as a bank holding company ("bhc"), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the banks to transfer funds to our bhc. as of december 31, 2017, funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona were $4.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.
on june 29, 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock ("2016 stock repurchase program") from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. through the end of the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of shares of common stock as part of the 2016 stock repurchase program. we repurchased an immaterial amount of our common stock through the end of 2017 as part of the 2017 stock repurchase program.
the timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. for additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation-dividends, stock repurchases and transfer of funds."
risk management risk framework we use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. we execute against our risk framework with the "three lines of defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.
the "first line of defense" is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. as the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. this principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the ceo and business heads. the "second line of defense" provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our risk management organization. the second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. the second line is both an "expert advisor" to the first line and an "effective challenger" of first line risk activities. the "third line of defense" is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions. the third line provides
74      capital one financial corporation (cof)
independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.
the risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise.
our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:
establish governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites the starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites. our board of directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the company. management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. this portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense, and the risk appetites and tolerance limits for risk taking.
identify and assess risks and ownership identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. this portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.
develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans we develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. the first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. controls may prevent risks from occurring or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels. the first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. the second line is a consultant on control design when needed.
test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action while the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests and oversees first and second line risk taking. these activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. control gaps are closed by first line corrective action.
escalate key risks and gaps to executive management and when appropriate, the board of directors escalation is an important component of our risk framework. use of escalation is encouraged and does not necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second, or third line risk management. through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decisions. escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. if appropriate, risks are escalated to the board of directors to ensure alignment with the most material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization.
calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing)
capital ultimately is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. as such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.
support with the right culture, talent and skills the right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. our risk framework is supported with the right culture that promotes the foundation and values of the risk management organization. skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. when needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates.

enabled by the right data, infrastructure and programs data, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our risk management processes and practices. these core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance, and cross-line interaction.
risk appetite risk appetite defines the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our board of directors to make business decisions. risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. the board of directors approves our risk appetite including risk appetite statements and associated metrics, board notification thresholds, and board limits for each of our eight risk categories. we communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence. while first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the chief risk officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the board of directors. the chief risk officer reports to the board of directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. in addition to his broader management responsibilities, our chief executive officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite.
risk categories we apply our risk framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. our eight major categories of risk are:
•   compliance risk: compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations;
•   credit risk: credit risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed;
•   legal risk: legal risk is the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions/consequences arising from litigation or regulatory action; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek/follow appropriate legal counsel when needed;
•   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period;
•   market risk: market risk is the risk that an institution's earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors;
•   operational risk: operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events;
•   reputation risk: reputation risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities; and
•   strategic risk: strategic risk is the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from: (i) the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; (ii) lack of responsiveness to these conditions; (iii) strategic decisions to change the company's scale, market position or operating model; or (iv) failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the company's strategy.
below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories.
76      capital one financial corporation (cof)
compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. in response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations.
our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance risk management program. business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and corporate compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.
credit risk management we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. in unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. in commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. in addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. in addition, the chief risk officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.
our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors.
legal risk management the general counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as compliance and internal audit. this evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.
liquidity risk management the chief financial officer and the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, are responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systematic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios. we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and appropriate
77      capital one financial corporation (cof)
action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan. management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly.
we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. from a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. from a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. we also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured markets through ongoing issuance. this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enables us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.
market risk management the chief financial officer and the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. we manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure.
we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the banking business due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
the market risk positions for the company and each of the banks are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. results are reported to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly. management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner.
the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program. in accordance with basel iii advanced approaches requirements, the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. corporate operational risk management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. the heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank. the executive vice president of external affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies.
78      capital one financial corporation (cof)
strategic risk management we monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. these items provide input for development of the company's strategy led by the chief executive officer and other senior executives. through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the chief risk officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.
credit risk profile our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.
we also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. we provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-investment securities" and credit risk related to derivative transactions in "note 10-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products. our primary loan products include credit cards, auto, home loans and commercial.
•   credit cards: we originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. the underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as fico, and on other factors, such as applicant income. we maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.
•   auto: we originate both prime and subprime auto loans. customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio. we generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.
•   home loans: most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. we previously originated residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing and dedicated home loan officers. on november 7, 2017, we announced our decision to cease new originations of residential mortgage and home equity loan products within our consumer banking business. we continue to service our existing home loan portfolio. our primary home loan products included conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. in general, our underwriting policy limits for such loans were:
◦   a maximum ltv ratio of 90% for loans without mortgage insurance;
◦   a maximum ltv ratio of 97% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products;
◦   a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and
◦   a maximum loan amount of $3 million.
79      capital one financial corporation (cof)
our underwriting procedures were intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. we might, in limited instances, have used automated valuation models to determine home values. our underwriting standards for conforming loans were designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the government-sponsored enterprises at a minimum, and we sold most of our conforming loans to these enterprises. we generally retained non-conforming mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit.
•   commercial: we offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, ltv ratio and standard covenants and conditions. we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten). in addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to the government-sponsored enterprises.
loans held for investment portfolio composition our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including pci loans, by portfolio segment as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $971 million and $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

purchased credit-impaired loans our portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans obtained in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for pci loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. these pci loans totaled $10.8 billion as of december 31, 2017 compared to $15.1 billion as of december 31, 2016.
the difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference, or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. we regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information on pci loans that are accounted for based on expected cash flows.
81      capital one financial corporation (cof)
home loans the majority of our home loan portfolio are pci loans from previous acquisitions, representing 58% and 67% of our total home loan portfolio as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the expected cash flows for the pci loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. in addition, pci loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming, as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.

(1)   due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. we report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. we assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years.
(2)   we report the maturity period for the home loan portfolio included in the consumer banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan.
credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans. trends in delinquency rates are one of the primary indicators of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, particularly in our credit card loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. in addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions.
we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. we also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.

(1)   percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. domestic card credit scores generally represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. we approximate non-fico credit scores to comparable fico scores for consistency purposes. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.
(2)   percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. auto credit scores generally represent average fico scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.
see "note 4-loans" in this report for additional credit quality information, and see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and tdrs for each of our loan categories.
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer's due date, measured at each balance sheet date. our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. the 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under "md&a-business segment financial performance."

table 23 summarizes loans that were 90+ days delinquent as to interest or principal, and still accruing interest as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. these loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ("ffiec"), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. while domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

(1)   we recognized interest income for loans classified as nonperforming of $52 million and $45 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $44 million and $59 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.
(2)   nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category.
(3)   beginning in the first quarter of 2017, partially charged-off auto loans previously presented within other assets were prospectively included within loans held for investment. other assets includes repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans and the net realizable value of certain partially charged-off auto loans, which will continue to decline over time.
(4)   excluding the impact of pci loans, the nonperforming loan rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 2.39% and 0.91%, respectively, as of december 31, 2017, compared to 3.81% and 0.90%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.
(5)   excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.60% and 1.08% as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(6)   the denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.

net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

in the credit card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in tdrs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. the effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
in the consumer banking business, the majority of our loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of the three. in addition, tdrs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. in certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.
in the commercial banking business, the majority of loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. the impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value.
we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in "note 4-loans."
impaired loans a loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdrs. loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. impaired loans also exclude pci loans, which are accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.

impaired loans totaled $2.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these amounts include tdrs of $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in "note 4-loans" and "note 5-allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."

(1)   allowance coverage ratios by loan category are calculated based on the allowance for loan and lease losses for each specified portfolio segment divided by period-end loans held for investment within the specified loan category.
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $999 million to $7.5 billion as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 30 basis points to 2.95% as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016. the increases were primarily driven by:
•   an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning; and
•   an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher losses associated with growth.
these increases were partially offset by an allowance decrease in our commercial loan portfolio primarily driven by charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio, as well as reduced exposure and improved credit risk ratings in our oil and gas portfolio.
liquidity risk profile we have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. we maintain these reserves in the form of readily-marketable or pledgeable assets that can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.

liquidity coverage ratio we are subject to the final liquidity coverage ratio rule ("final lcr rule") issued by the federal banking agencies. the final lcr rule came into effect in january 2015 and required us to calculate the lcr daily starting july 1, 2016. the minimum lcr standard was phased-in beginning january 1, 2015 and is at 100% as of january 1, 2017. at december 31, 2017, we exceeded the fully phased-in lcr requirement. the calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.
borrowing capacity we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on march 31, 2015, which expires in march 2018. under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. there is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. we expect to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration statement. we also filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on january 12, 2016, which expires in january 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust.
in addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to fhlb advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $21.0 billion, of which $11.9 billion was still available to us to borrow as of december 31, 2017. the ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks' ability to post collateral. our fhlb membership is secured by our investment in fhlb stock of $360 million and $760 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. we also have access to the federal reserve discount window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $7.4 billion as of december 31, 2017. our membership with the federal reserve is secured by our investment in federal reserve stock, totaling $1.2 billion as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016.
funding the company's primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds. in addition to deposits, the company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, fhlb advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. a key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.

short-term borrowings and long-term debt we access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. in addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term fhlb advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. substantially all of our long-term fhlb advances are structured with either a monthly or a quarterly call option at our discretion.
our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. the short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $416 million to $576 million as of december 31, 2017 from december 31, 2016.

credit ratings our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs.

contractual obligations in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. table 34 summarizes, by remaining contractual maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2017. the actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented below due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases. table 34 excludes short-term obligations such as trade payables, representation and warranty reserves, and obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, which are discussed in more detail in "note 19-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" and "note 15-employee benefit plans."

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.
primary market risk exposures our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. we also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.
interest rate risk interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the u.k. and canada. the largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the great british pound ("gbp") and the canadian dollar ("cad"), respectively. we also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate.
96      capital one financial corporation (cof)
our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk exposure in our aoci and capital ratios. we manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. we use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our aoci exposure. we apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging denominated in gbp.
we measure our total exposure from non-dollar-denominated intercompany borrowings to our international businesses by regularly tracking the value of the loans made to our foreign operations and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts we use to hedge them. we apply a 1% u.s. dollar appreciation shock against these exposures to measure the impact to our consolidated statements of income from foreign exchange transaction risk. the intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 741 million gbp and 786 million gbp as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 6.4 billion cad and 6.2 billion cad as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
we measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our u.k. and canadian operations. our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. we apply a 30% u.s. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. our gross equity exposures in our u.k. and canadian operations were 1.6 billion and 1.5 billion gbp as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.0 billion cad and 863 million cad as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
as a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.
customer-related trading risk we offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to customers within our commercial banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. these exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. as a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.
we employ value-at-risk ("var") as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. var is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. we employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. we use internal models to produce a daily var measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.
for further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see "note 10-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions. derivatives are the primary tools that we use for managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. use of derivatives is included in our current market risk management policies. we execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter ("otc") and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $196.6 billion as of december 31, 2017 from $142.9 billion as of december 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.
97      capital one financial corporation (cof)
market risk measurement we have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the board of directors. our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. we provide additional information below in "economic value of equity."
we consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. due to the increase in interest rates since december 31, 2016, we have incorporated a 100-basis points decline scenario into our interest rate sensitivity analysis. we use this 100-basis points decrease as our largest magnitude declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. in scenarios where a 100-basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.
net interest income sensitivity this sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. in addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points and -100 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. at the current level of interest rates, our net interest income remains mostly unchanged in the -50, +50 and +100 basis points scenarios and decreases slightly in the -100 and +200 basis points scenarios.
economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points and -100 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.
our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.
table 35 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. during the second quarter of 2017, we updated our projected commercial deposit attrition assumptions that resulted in longer life of these deposit balances and accounts for most of the decrease in economic value of equity sensitivity from december 31, 2016. our net interest income sensitivity measures were largely unchanged from this assumption update.

limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. we regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

we include certain non-gaap measures in the following tables. we consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. while our non-gaap measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. these non-gaap measures are individually identified and calculations are explained in footnotes below the table. the following tables present reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with gaap.

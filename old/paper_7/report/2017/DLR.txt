overview our company. digital realty trust, inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock, or our ipo, on november 3, 2004. we believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code. our company was formed on march 9, 2004. during the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our ipo, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the company. our operating partnership was formed on july 21, 2004.
on september 14, 2017, we completed the acquisition of dupont fabros technology, inc., in an all-stock merger, which we refer to as the dft merger, for equity consideration of approximately $6.2 billion. we believe this transaction expanded our reach with a complementary footprint in top u.s. metropolitan areas while enhancing our ability to meet the growing demand for hyper-scale and public cloud solutions and solidifying our blue-chip customer base. as part of the dft merger, we acquired 15 data centers, 14 of which are located in the united states and one is located in canada.
on september 14, 2017, pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") by and among digital realty trust, inc., digital realty trust, l.p., penguins reit sub, llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of digital realty trust, inc.("merger sub"), penguins op sub 2, llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of digital realty trust, l.p. ("merger sub gp"), penguins op sub, llc, a subsidiary of digital realty trust, l.p. and merger sub gp (the "partnership merger sub"), dupont fabros technology, inc., a maryland corporation ("dft"), and dupont fabros technology, l.p., a maryland limited partnership (the "dft operating partnership") (i) dft merged with and into merger sub (the "reit merger") and (ii) the partnership merger sub merged with and into the dft operating partnership (the "partnership merger" and, together with the reit merger, the "dft merger" or "the merger"). upon completion of the reit merger, merger sub survived and the separate corporate existence of dft ceased.
business and strategy. our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our operating partnership's unitholders through the payment of distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. we expect to accomplish our objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies. we plan to focus on our core business of investing in and developing and operating data centers. a significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development and acquisition of new properties. we target high quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers and properties that may be developed for such use. most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. we focus exclusively on owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers because we believe that the growth in data center demand and the technology-related real estate industry generally will continue to outpace the overall economy.
as of december 31, 2017, our portfolio included 205 data centers, including seven data centers held-for-sale and 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 32.1 million rentable square feet including approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development. the 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet. the 21 parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately 539 acres. at december 31, 2017, approximately 2.7 million square feet was under construction for turn-key flex®, colocation and

we have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. we expect to continue to acquire additional assets as part of our growth strategy. we intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. we may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated demand and returns.
we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. we are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. we target a debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio at or less than 5.5x, fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. in addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost.
revenue base. as of december 31, 2017, we operated 205 data centers through our operating partnership, including seven data centers held-for-sale and 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and developable land. these data centers are mainly located throughout north america, with 38 located in europe, seven in asia and five properties in australia. we, through our predecessor, acquired our first portfolio property in january 2002 and have added properties through acquisition and development activities as set forth in the table below:
the following table presents an overview of our portfolio of data centers, including the seven data centers held-for-sale and 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and developable land, based on information as of december 31, 2017.

(1)   current net rentable square feet as of december 31, 2017, which represents the current square feet under lease as specified in the applicable lease agreements plus management's estimate of space available for lease based on engineering drawings. includes customers' proportional share of common areas and excludes space under active development and space held for development.
(2)   space under active development includes current base building and data center projects in progress.
(3)   space held for development includes space held for future data center development, and excludes space under active development.
as of december 31, 2017, our portfolio, including the 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, were approximately 90.2% leased excluding approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development. due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations being supported, our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. as of december 31, 2017, our average remaining lease term is approximately five years. our scheduled lease expirations through december 31, 2019 are 22.1% of rentable square feet excluding month-to-month leases, space under active development and space held for development as of december 31, 2017.
factors which may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions. general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum. the terms of any withdrawal are subject to ongoing negotiations. nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal. instability in the u.s., european, asia pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our customers, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our customers', financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. we cannot assure you that long-term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity. such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.
foreign currency exchange risk. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had foreign operations in the united kingdom, ireland, france, the netherlands, germany, switzerland, canada, singapore, australia, japan and hong kong, and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. our foreign operations are conducted in the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, singapore dollar, australian dollar, japanese yen and the hong kong dollar. our primary currency exposures are to the british pound sterling, the euro and the singapore dollar. the possible exit of the united kingdom (or any other country) from the european union, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in increased foreign currency exchange volatility. we attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations, although there can be no assurance that this will be effective. as a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to u.s. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets, the book value of our debt and the amount of stockholders' equity.
rental income. the amount of rental income generated by the data centers in our portfolio depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. excluding approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active
55
index to financial statements development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development as of december 31, 2017, the occupancy rate of our portfolio, including the 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 90.2% of our net rentable square feet.
as of december 31, 2017, we had over 2,300 tenants in our data center portfolio, including the 13 data centers held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 2% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index. we cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates.
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties, which in turn depends on several factors, including supply and demand and market rates for data center space. included in our approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet, excluding space under active development and space held for development and 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, at december 31, 2017 is approximately 1.4 million square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease. our turn-key flex® product is an effective solution for customers who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive data center infrastructure and security. our expertise in data center construction and operations enables us to lease space to these customers at a premium over other uses. in addition, as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development, or approximately 14% of the total rentable space in our portfolio, including the 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which we may not be able to obtain. development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop data center facilities that are ready for use and, in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space. we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future. we will require additional capital to finance our development activities, which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, including as a result of the conditions described above under "global market and economic conditions."
in addition, the timing between when we sign a new lease with a customer and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable. certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space, the timing of which may be delayed significantly.
economic downturns, including as a result of the conditions described above under "global market and economic conditions," or regional downturns affecting our metropolitan areas or downturns in the data center industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space, or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our customers to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties.
scheduled lease expirations. our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. in addition to approximately 2.5 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, which excludes approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development as of december 31, 2017 and the five data centers held as investments in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, leases representing approximately 8.1% and 14.0% of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we signed new leases totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 2.1 million square feet of space. the following table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended december 31, 2017:

(1)   for some of our properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area.
(2)   rental rates represent annual estimated cash rent per rentable square foot adjusted for straight-line rents in accordance with gaap. gaap rental rates are inclusive of tenant concessions, if any.
(3)   excludes short-term leases.
(4)   commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2017 to 2018.
(5)   includes leases signed for new and re-leased space.
our ability to re-lease or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. we continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and, subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas, expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on re-leased or renewed data center space leases for 2018 expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a gaap basis and slightly down on a cash basis. for the year ended december 31, 2017, rents on renewed space increased by an average of 4.0% on a gaap basis on our turn-key flex® space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of 25.4% on a gaap basis on our powered base building® space compared to the expiring rents. our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our data centers will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.

index to financial statements geographic concentration. we depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional metropolitan areas can impact our future results. as of december 31, 2017, our portfolio, including the 18 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas:

(1)   annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of december 31, 2017 multiplied by 12. the aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended december 31, 2017 was approximately $21.4 million.
operating expenses. our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases. in particular, our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations contained in them. many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. however, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for turn-key flex® facilities. we also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, sec reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes-oxley act. increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance. we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.
climate change legislation. in june 2009, the u.s. house of representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or ghg, emissions, via a cap-and-trade program. the u.s. senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. new climate change legislation was introduced in the u.s. senate in 2013, but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists.
in the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation, over the past several years, regulatory agencies, primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency, or epa, and states took the lead in regulating ghg emissions in the u.s. under the obama administration, the epa moved aggressively to regulate ghg emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its own authority under the clean air act. the trump administration has signaled that it intends to eliminate or modify certain of the epa's ghg emissions regulations and refocus the epa's mission away from such regulation.
58
index to financial statements the epa made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of ghgs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. under the obama administration, the epa finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit ghgs under the clean air act new source review prevention of significant deterioration, or nsr psd, and title v permitting programs. as a result, newly-issued nsr psd and title v permits for new or modified electricity generating units (egus) and other facilities may need to address ghg emissions, including by requiring the installation of "best available control technology." the epa implemented in december 2015 the "clean power plan" regulating carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from new and existing coal-fired and natural gas egus. existing egus are subject to statewide co2 emissions reduction targets, an effort designed to achieve a thirty-two percent reduction in nationwide existing egu co2 emissions by 2030 (in comparison to 2005 levels). new, modified, and reconstructed egus are subject to "new source performance standards" that include both technological requirements and numeric emission limits. however, twenty-four states and a number of industry groups challenged the clean power plan in federal court, and in february 2016 the u.s. supreme court issued a stay of the clean power plan until the legal challenges have been decided. in march 2017, president trump ordered the epa to review and if appropriate revise or rescind the clean power plan, and the epa initiated this review in april 2017. separately, the epa's ghg "reporting rule" requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report ghg emissions. the trump administration may seek to revise or reverse these regulations.
as a result, states may drive near-term regulation to reduce ghg emissions in the united states. at the state level, california implemented a ghg cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in january 2013. in september 2016, california adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in ghg emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and in july 2017, california extended its cap-and-trade program through 2030. as another example of state action, washington began implementing in 2017 a cap on ghg emissions, and the cap will decrease over time.
outside the united states, the european union, or eu (including the united kingdom), has been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of ghgs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the eu has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements).  the paris agreement, which was adopted by the united states and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels officially went into force on november 4, 2016. president trump announced in june 2017 that he will initiate the process to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement; however, a number of states have formed groups supporting the paris agreement. national legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the eu.  for example, in the united kingdom, the implementation of the crc energy efficiency scheme introduced a mandatory reporting and pricing scheme that is designed to incentivize energy efficiency and cut emissions by large energy users. it is not yet clear how brexit will impact the united kingdom's (or the eu's) approach to climate change regulation. in canada, the first compliance period under ontario's ghg cap-and-trade program began in january 2017. climate change regulations are in various stages of implementation in other nations as well, including nations where we operate, such as australia, where a ghg emissions cap was implemented in 2016.
the cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the epa has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the eu or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our customers. these matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
interest rates. as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.0 billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loans, along with $558.2 million, $406.8 million and $150.1 million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the global revolving credit facility, the unswapped portion of the unsecured term loans and the floating rate notes due 2019, or the 2019 notes, respectively. the availability of debt and equity capital may decrease or be on unfavorable terms as a result of the circumstances described above under "global market and economic conditions" or other factors. the effects on commercial real estate mortgages, if available, include, but may not be limited to: higher loan spreads, tightened loan covenants, reduced loan-to-value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments. potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets. increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap
59
index to financial statements agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our interest expense. if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to digital realty trust, inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a reit.
demand for data center space. our portfolio consists primarily of data centers. a decrease in the demand for, or increase in supply of, data center space, internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified customer base or less specialized use. we have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major metropolitan areas prior to having executed leases with respect to this space. we believe that demand in key metropolitan areas such as northern virginia, dallas and chicago is largely in line with supply. we also continue to see strong demand in other key metropolitan areas across our portfolio. however, until this inventory is leased up, which will depend on a number of factors, including available data center space in these metropolitan areas, our return on invested capital is negatively impacted. our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions and the other circumstances described above under "global market and economic conditions," as well as adverse developments in the corporate data center, internet and data communications and broader technology industries. any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for data center space. reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve. changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. in addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our customers' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. in addition, demand for data center space, or the rates at which we lease space, may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific metropolitan areas as a result of an increase in the number of competitors, or the amount of space being offered in our metropolitan areas and other metropolitan areas by our competitors.
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. our actual results may differ from these estimates. we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in item 8, note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate. the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements, the occupancy of the building, the term and rate of in-place leases, the creditworthiness of the customers, favorable or unfavorable financing, above- or below-market ground leases and numerous other factors.
accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities. this includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, ground leases, if any, and tenant improvements. additionally, we evaluate the value of in-place leases on occupancy and market rent, the value of the tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above (or below) market leases, any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller. each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. for example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term (including renewal and extension assumptions) of the leases. additionally,
60
index to financial statements the amortization of the value (or negative value) assigned to above (or below) market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place tenant leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated income statements.
from time to time, we will receive offers from third parties to purchase our properties, either solicited or unsolicited. for those offers that we accept, the prospective buyers will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transactions. it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. we classify real estate as "held for sale" when all criteria under the gaap guidance have been met.
useful lives of assets. we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
asset impairment evaluation. we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. when such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. we consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.
we generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. in certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value.
goodwill impairment evaluation. we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and between annual tests, we evaluate goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  in our impairment tests of goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  if based on this assessment, we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is not less than its carrying value, then performing the additional two-step impairment test is unnecessary. if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. we test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value of the net assets, including goodwill, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value. we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized.
61
index to financial statements revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the customer leases. deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straight-line basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases. many of our leases contain provisions under which the customers reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. however, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for turn-key flex® facilities. such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. as discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below-market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of above-market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below-market leases.
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. these estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period.
share-based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. the calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.

stabilized rental revenues increased $6.1 million, or 0.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of new leasing at our properties during the year ended december 31, 2017, the largest of which was for space at 1-11 templar road, 1725 comstock street and 200 paul avenue, offset by expiring leases at certain properties in the stabilized portfolio. stabilized tenant reimbursement revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of increased property tax reimbursements due to one-time reductions in 2016 at two properties in the stabilized portfolio as well as lower utility reimbursements due to decreased usage and vacancies at certain properties. stabilized interconnection and other revenues increased $21.2 million, or 11.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of increased demand and product sales during the year ended december 31, 2017 in the stabilized portfolio.
pre-stabilized and other revenue increases during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 were primarily a result of the properties acquired in the dft merger, which contributed approximately $115.4 million and $62.3 million to the rental revenue and tenant reimbursement increases, respectively. in addition, the european portfolio

stabilized rental revenues and tenant reimbursement revenues remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of new leasing at our properties during the year ended december 31, 2016, the largest of which were for space at 2121 south price road and 2045 & 2055 lafayette street, offset by the british pound sterling and euro weakening against the u.s. dollar.
pre-stabilized and other revenue increases during the year ended december 31, 2016 were primarily a result of the telx acquisition and the european portfolio acquisition, which contributed approximately $209.0 million and $157.8 million to rental revenue and interconnection revenue, respectively, along with new leases at our properties during the year ended december 31, 2016, which were primarily leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space at 44060 digital loudoun plaza, 907 security row, 29a international business park and 9355 grand avenue, offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2016.
fee income occasionally, customers engage the company for certain services. the nature of these services historically involves property management, construction management, and assistance with financing. the proper revenue recognition of these services can be different, depending on whether the arrangements are service revenue or contractor type revenue. service revenues are typically recognized on an equal monthly basis based on the minimum fee to be earned. the monthly amounts could be adjusted depending on if certain performance milestones are met.
fee income also includes management fees. these fees arise from contractual agreements with entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest. the management fees are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. management and other fee income related to partially owned entities are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated interest.

stabilized property taxes increased by approximately $1.4 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of increased assessed taxes at one of our properties in illinois.
pre-stabilized and other rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $102.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the properties acquired in the dft merger, which contributed approximately $51.2 million along with the european portfolio acquisition, which contributed approximately $20.4 million to the increase, and leasing of completed and delivered inventory.
pre-stabilized and other property tax expense increased approximately $20.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a tax refund received in 2016 at one property in singapore related to a change in assessed value along with the properties acquired in the dft merger, which contributed approximately $5.3 million.

other other expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was due to the write off of straight-line rent receivables related to the telx acquisition ($75.3 million), which was partially offset by a gain related to the settlement of pre-existing tenant relationships with telx ($14.4 million).

liquidity and capital resources of the parent company
68
index to financial statements in this "liquidity and capital resources of the parent company" section and in the "liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership" section below, the term, our "parent company", refers to digital realty trust, inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our operating partnership.
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company's business is operated primarily through our operating partnership, of which our parent company is the sole general partner and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. because our parent company operates on a consolidated basis with our operating partnership, the section entitled "liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of our parent company on a consolidated basis and how our company is operated as a whole.
our parent company issues public equity from time to time, but generally does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership. our parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of the indebtedness of our operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of our operating partnership. therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of our parent company and our operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by our parent company. however, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level. our parent company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. our parent company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from our operating partnership.
.
as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, our parent company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership's day-to-day management and control. our parent company causes our operating partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our parent company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our operating partnership's partnership agreement. our parent company receives proceeds from its equity issuances from time to time, but is generally required by our operating partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to our operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of our operating partnership.
our parent company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on september 22, 2017, which allows our parent company to register an unspecified amount of various classes of equity securities. as circumstances warrant, our parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. any proceeds from such equity issuances would be generally contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our operating partnership. our operating partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.
the liquidity of our parent company is dependent on our operating partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to our parent company. the primary cash requirement of our parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. our parent company also guarantees our operating partnership's, as well as certain of its subsidiaries' and affiliates', unsecured debt. if our operating partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger parent company guarantee obligations, then our parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. however, our parent company's only material asset is its investment in our operating partnership.
we believe our operating partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our parent company and, in turn, for our parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. however, we cannot assure you that our operating partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our parent company. the lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our operating partnership's ability to pay its distributions to our parent company, which would in turn, adversely affect our parent company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.
our parent company entered into equity distribution agreements in june 2011, which we refer to as the 2011 equity distribution agreements, with each of merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated, citigroup global markets inc., credit suisse securities (usa) llc, deutsche bank securities inc. and morgan stanley & co. llc, or the agents, under which it can issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through, at
69
index to financial statements its discretion, any of the agents as its sales agents. the sales of common stock made under the 2011 equity distribution agreements will be made in "at the market" offerings as defined in rule 415 of the securities act. cumulatively through december 31, 2017, our parent company had generated net proceeds of approximately $342.7 million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common shares under the 2011 equity distribution agreements at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents and before offering expenses. no sales were made under the program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. as of december 31, 2017, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.

we used the net proceeds from the offerings of the 2.750% 2024 notes, the usd notes and the series j preferred stock to fund a portion of the repayment, redemption and/or discharge of dft debt and the payment of certain transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with the dft merger.
future uses of cash our parent company may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our operating partnership or its subsidiaries through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under "dividends and distributions."
dividends and distributions our parent company is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order for it to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. accordingly, our parent company intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our operating partnership's operating activities. while historically our parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. all such distributions are at the discretion of our parent company's board of directors. our parent company considers market factors and our operating partnership's performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels. our parent company has distributed at least 100% of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal income taxes. amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our parent company's status as a reit.
as a result of this distribution requirement, our operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can. our parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our operating partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. in addition, our parent company may be required to use borrowings under our global revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our parent company's reit status.

distributions out of our parent company's current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income whereas distributions in excess of our parent company's current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent company's stock, are generally classified as a return of capital. distributions in excess of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent company's stock are generally characterized as capital gain. cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis, however, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund distributions.
the expected tax treatment of distributions on our parent company's common and preferred stock paid in 2017 is as follows: approximately 95% ordinary income and 5% capital gain distribution. the tax treatment of distributions on our parent company's common and preferred stock paid in 2016 was as follows: approximately 98% ordinary income and 2% capital gain distribution.

liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership in this "liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership" section, the terms "we", "our" and "us" refer to our operating partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries or our operating partnership and our parent company together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. because we operate on a consolidated basis with our parent company, the section entitled "liquidity and capital resources of the parent company" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $0.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $13.1 million of restricted cash. restricted cash primarily consists of contractual capital expenditures plus other deposits.
our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses, development costs and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our parent company in order for it to make dividend payments on its preferred stock, distributions to our parent company in order for it to make dividend payments to its stockholders required to maintain its reit status, distributions to the unitholders of common limited partnership interests in digital realty trust, l.p., capital expenditures, debt service on our loans and senior notes, and, potentially, acquisitions. we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, restricted cash accounts established for certain future payments and by drawing upon our global revolving credit facility.
we are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. we target a debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio at or less than 5.5x, fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. in addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the related cost.
on january 15, 2016, we refinanced our global revolving credit facility and entered into a global senior credit agreement for a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the global revolving credit facility, that replaced the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility executed on august 15, 2013, as amended. the global revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that would enable us to increase the borrowing capacity of the credit facility to up to $2.5 billion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. the refinanced facility matures on january 15, 2020, with two six-month extension options available. the interest rate for borrowings under the global revolving credit facility equals the applicable index plus a margin which is based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt and is currently 100 basis points. an annual facility fee on the total commitment amount of the facility, based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt, currently 20 basis points, is payable quarterly. funds may be drawn in u.s., canadian, singapore, australian and hong kong dollars, as well as euro, british pound sterling and japanese yen. as of december 31, 2017, borrowings under the global revolving credit facility bore interest at an overall blended rate of 2.15% composed of 2.48% (u.s. dollars), 1.50% (british pound sterling), 0.62% (euros), 2.20% (hong kong dollars), 0.96% (japanese yen) and 2.36% (canadian dollars). the interest rates were based on 1-month libor, 1-month gbp libor, 1-month euribor, 1-month hibor, 1-month jpy libor and 1-month cdor, respectively, plus a margin of 1.00%. the facility also bore a base borrowing rate of 4.50% (usd) which is based on the u.s. prime rate. we have used and intend to use borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes. the global revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments or merge with another company, and requirements to maintain financial coverage ratios, including with respect to unencumbered assets. in addition, the global revolving credit facility restricts digital realty trust, inc. from making distributions to its stockholders, or redeeming or otherwise repurchasing shares of its capital stock, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, except in limited circumstances including as necessary to enable digital realty trust, inc. to maintain its qualification as a reit and to minimize the payment of income or excise tax. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of such covenants. as of december 31, 2017, we have capitalized approximately $7.2 million of financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the global revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2017, approximately $558.2 million was drawn under this facility and $22.8 million of letters of credit were issued, leaving approximately $1.5 billion available for use.
on january 15, 2016, we refinanced our senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility and entered into a term loan agreement, which governs (i) a $1.25 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which we refer to as the 5-year term loan, and (ii) a $300 million 7-year senior unsecured term loan, which we refer to as the 7-year term loan. the 2016 term loan

index to financial statements agreement replaced the $1.0 billion term loan agreement executed on april 16, 2012, as amended. the 5-year term loan matures on january 15, 2021 and the 7-year term loan matures on january 15, 2023. in addition, we have the ability from time to time to increase the aggregate size of lending under the 2016 term loan agreement from $1.55 billion to up to $1.8 billion, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. interest rates are based on our senior unsecured debt ratings and are currently 110 basis points and 155 basis points over the applicable index for floating rate advances for the 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan, respectively. funds may be drawn in u.s., canadian, singapore, australian and hong kong dollars, as well as euro, british pound sterling and japanese yen. based on exchange rates in effect at december 31, 2017, the balance outstanding is approximately $1.4 billion, excluding deferred financing costs. we have used borrowings under the term loan for acquisitions, repayment of indebtedness, development, working capital and general corporate purposes. the covenants under the term loans are consistent with our global revolving credit facility and, as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of such covenants. as of december 31, 2017, we have capitalized approximately $4.8 million of financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the 2016 unsecured term loans.

our parent company commenced its at-the-market equity distribution program in june 2011, which is discussed under "liquidity and capital resources of the parent company" above. to date, our parent company has generated net proceeds of approximately $342.7 million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock under the program at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents and before offering expenses. the proceeds from the issuances were contributed to us in exchange for the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common units to our parent company. no sales were made under the program during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. as of december 31, 2017, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.

on february 9, 2018, the operating partnership closed on the sale of 34551 ardenwood boulevard, a 323,000 square foot technology manufacturing property in silicon valley for approximately $73 million. we expect to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $25 million in the first quarter of 2018. the property was classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2017.
on january 25, 2018, the operating partnership closed on the sale of 200 quannapowitt parkway, a substantially vacant, 211,000 square foot data center redevelopment project in boston for $15 million. we expect to recognize a loss on the sale of approximately $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. the property was classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2017.
none of our property sales to date represented a significant component or significant shift in strategy that would require discontinued operations presentation.
the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower as such private investors typically have lower return expectations than we do. as a result, we anticipate that near-term single-asset acquisitions activity will comprise a smaller percentage of our growth until seller price expectations realign with our return requirements.

land inventory and space held for development reflect cumulative cost spent pending future development. base building construction consists of ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future data center fit-out. datacenter construction includes 1.4 million square feet of turn key flex®, colocation and powered base building® products with a cost to date of approximately $748.0 million. generally, we expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules. equipment pool and other inventory represent the value of long-lead time equipment and materials required for timely deployment and delivery of data center construction fit-out. campus, tenant improvements and other costs include the value of development work which benefits space recently converted to our operating portfolio and is composed primarily of shared infrastructure projects and first-generation tenant improvements.
future uses of cash our properties require periodic investments of capital for customer-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately 2.7 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.7 million square feet of space held for development and we also owned approximately 1.4 million net rentable square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements. turn-key flex® space is move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment required to provide a data center environment. depending on demand for additional turn-key flex® space, we expect to incur significant tenant improvement costs to build out and develop these types of spaces. at december 31, 2017, approximately 2.7 million square feet was under construction for turn-key flex®, colocation and powered base building® products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in seven u.s. metropolitan areas, four european metropolitan areas, two australian metropolitan areas, one canadian metropolitan area and one asian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 1.3 million square feet of base building construction and 1.4

index to financial statements million square feet of data center construction. at december 31, 2017, we had open commitments, including amounts reimbursable of approximately $6.3 million, related to construction contracts of approximately $317.3 million.
we currently expect to incur approximately $0.9 billion to $1.1 billion of capital expenditures for our development programs during the year ending december 31, 2018, although this amount may increase or decrease, potentially materially, based on numerous factors, including changes in demand, leasing results and availability of debt or equity capital.

total capital expenditures (excluding indirect costs)      $1,054,847                  $654,189
for the year ended december 31, 2017, total capital expenditures increased $400.7 million to approximately $1,054.8 million from $654.2 million for the same period in 2016. capital expenditures on our development projects plus our enhancement and improvements projects for the year ended december 31, 2017 were approximately $918.6 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 59% from the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily due to increased spending for ground-up development projects, turn-key flex space development and base building improvements. our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital.
indirect costs related to construction and leasing activities, including capitalized interest, capitalized in the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $95.8 million and $85.2 million, respectively. capitalized interest comprised approximately $21.7 million and $16.3 million of the total indirect costs capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. capitalized interest in the year ended december 31, 2017 increased compared to the same period in 2016 due to an increase in qualifying activities. excluding capitalized interest, the indirect costs increased in the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to increased capitalized amounts relating to compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction and leasing activities. see "-future uses of cash" above for a discussion of the amount of capital expenditures we expect to incur during the year ending december 31, 2018.
we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under "commitments and contingencies," "off-balance sheet arrangements" and "distributions."
we actively pursue opportunities for potential acquisitions, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. the dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending december 31, 2018 will be based on numerous factors, including customer demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities.
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our parent company through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our parent company in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
we expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including to pay for scheduled debt maturities and to fund acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our parent company. we also may fund future short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, using our global revolving credit facility pending permanent financing. if we are not able to obtain additional financing on terms attractive to us, or at all, including as a result of the circumstances described above under "factors which may influence future results of operations-global market and economic conditions", we may be required to reduce our acquisition or capital expenditure plans, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.

as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $8.7 billion of outstanding consolidated long-term debt as set forth in the table above. our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 25% (based on the closing price of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock on december 31, 2017 of $113.90). for this purpose, our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust, inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), plus the liquidation value of digital realty trust, inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of our operating partnership's units not held by digital realty trust, inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, class c units and class d units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.
the variable rate debt shown above bore interest at interest rates based on various one-month libor, euribor, gbp libor, sor, bbr, hibor, jpy libor, cdor and u.s. prime rates, depending on the respective agreement governing the

cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased approximately $112.1 million over 2016 and cash provided by operating activities in 2016 increased approximately $114.4 million over 2015. the 2017 increase was driven by year-over-year increase in the cash flow from properties acquired in the july 2016 european portfolio acquisition and the cash flow from properties acquired in the september 2017 dft merger. the increases in cash flow were offset by properties sold in 2016 and 2017 and an increase in interest expense. the 2016 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was due to the telx acquisition and european portfolio acquisition and increased revenues from new leasing at our stabilized properties, completed and leased development space which was partially offset by increased operating and interest expenses.
net cash used in investing activities in 2017 increased $53.6 million over 2016 due to an increase in improvements to investments in real estate that were primarily development driven offset by a larger 2016 cash acquisition total (net of cash dispositions in both periods). net cash used in investing activities in 2016 decreased $1.2 billion over 2015 due to decreased acquisition activity, partially offset by proceeds from property sales of $359.3 million in 2016 as compared to $185.6 million in 2015.

index to financial statements net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $29.4 million in 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2017 as compared to 2016, offset by increased repayments of borrowings on the global revolving credit facility, a decrease in net equity issuances and an increase in dividends and distributions paid in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase in dividend and distribution payments for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding and dividend amount per share of common stock in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the payment of dividends on our series j preferred stock during the year ended december 31, 2017, whereas this series of preferred stock was not outstanding in year ended december 31, 2016. the 2017 borrowing activity was used to fund a portion of the repayment, redemption and/or discharge of dft debt and the payment of certain transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with the dft merger. the 2016 equity issuance was driven primarily by the european portfolio acquisition.
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was a result of lower net repayments on borrowings along with the sale of common stock, issuance of series i preferred stock, and the sale of unsecured notes due 2020, 2022 and 2025 in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2016, which included the issuance of common stock offset by the redemption of our series e preferred stock, in addition to higher dividend and distribution payments. the increase in dividend and distribution payments for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding and dividend amount per share of common stock in 2016 as compared to 2015 and the payment of dividends on our series i preferred stock during the year ended december 31, 2016, whereas this series of preferred stock was not outstanding for the entire year ended december 31, 2015.

net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $29.4 million in 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2017 as compared to 2016, offset by increased repayments of borrowings on the global revolving credit facility, a decrease in net equity issuances and an increase in distributions paid in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase in distribution payments for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was due to an increase in the number of units outstanding and distribution amount per common unit in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the payment of distributions on our series j preferred units during the year ended december 31, 2017, whereas this series of preferred units was not outstanding in year ended december 31, 2016. the 2017 borrowing activity was used to fund a portion of the repayment, redemption and/or discharge of dft debt and the payment of certain transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection with the dft merger. the 2016 equity issuance was driven primarily by the european portfolio acquisition.
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was a result of lower net repayments on borrowings along with the sale of common units, issuance of series i preferred units, and the sale of unsecured notes due 2020, 2022 and 2025 in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2016, which included the issuance of common units offset by the redemption of our series e preferred units, in addition to higher distribution payments. the increase in distribution payments for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to an increase in the number of units outstanding and distribution amount per common unit in 2016 as compared to 2015 and the payment of distributions on our series i preferred units during the year ended december 31, 2016, whereas this series of preferred units was not outstanding for the entire year ended december 31, 2015.

index to financial statements noncontrolling interests in operating partnership noncontrolling interests relate to the common units in our operating partnership that are not owned by digital realty trust, inc., which, as of december 31, 2017, amounted to 4.0% of our operating partnership common units. in conjunction with our formation, our operating partnership issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties.
limited partners who acquired common units in connection with our formation have the right to require our operating partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock at the time of the redemption. alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. pursuant to registration rights agreements we entered into with these third-party contributors, we filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon redemption of the common units, and the resale of those shares of common stock by the holders. in connection with the dft merger, approximately 0.5 million common units of the operating partnership were issued to certain former unitholders in dupont fabros technology, l.p., which are subject to certain restrictions and, accordingly, are not presented as permanent capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
inflation many of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. in addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.
funds from operations we calculate funds from operations, or ffo, in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts, or nareit. ffo represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, excluding a gain from a pre-existing relationship and after adjustments for impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), non-controlling interests in operating partnership, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions and certain other gains and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and certain other items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. we also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits, ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits. however, because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited. other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and, accordingly, our ffo may not be comparable to other reits' ffo. ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance.

in order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  see reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 41 for reconciliations between non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.
we operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states.  accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states.  constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
overview we believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  we are guided by our long-term strategy, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.

our balanced, diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty. we believe that our range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumers beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass-market distribution.
·                  our skin care product category benefits from hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer.  during fiscal 2017, we continued to expand these product lines through the introduction of the advanced night repair eye concentrate matrix from estée lauder and the revitalizing hydrating serum from la mer.  glamglow also contributed to the success in the category through targeted expanded consumer reach and new launches such as plumprageous.  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we purchased a minority interest in deciem, a skin care brand, which provides us with a strategic investment in a company that attracts millennials and a diverse consumer base.
·                  in our makeup category, we further developed hero product lines such as double wear and pure color envy from estée lauder through the launch of additional products including double wear nude cushion stick radiant makeup and pure color envy hi-lustre light sculpting lipstick.  we continuously look to acquire brands that complement our existing business, have significant sales growth potential and provide opportunities for future profitable growth.  during our fiscal 2017 second quarter, we expanded our makeup portfolio with the acquisitions of too faced and becca. both of these brands are primarily distributed in the faster growing specialty-multi and online channels.  they are expected to help us reach new consumers, to increase our sales in these channels and to continue generating strong profitable growth.
·                  our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of jo malone london and tom ford fragrances, as well as from our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions.  we have also benefited from the growth of the fragrance category in the asia/pacific region and look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there.
·                  in our hair care category, we are reaching new consumers as we expand our presence beyond salons, such as the planned september 2017 launch of bumble and bumble in ulta beauty, a leading specialty-multi retailer in the united states.
our global footprint provides many avenues of growth.  we leverage our regional organizations and the talents and expertise of our people to continue to be locally relevant through evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel.  this includes the expansion of our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories.  we tailor our strategy by country with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.  we continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, such as the united states and the united kingdom, and broaden our presence in emerging markets, including the middle east, russia, south africa and brazil.
·                  in north america, we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth, despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar department stores, and in latin america we continue to launch new brands, expand the integration of social media and gain share in prestige beauty by encouraging consumers to trade up from mass-market products.
·                  in europe, the middle east & africa, we are expanding our digital and social media presence as well as leveraging our makeup strength to gain share in prestige beauty.
·                  in asia/pacific, particularly in china, we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio to benefit from the growth of the makeup and fragrance categories as well as continuing to launch new skin care products such as the clinique fresh pressed line of products with vitamin c.
we approach distribution strategically by brand, distribution channel and product category.  we are adding brands to faster growing channels, such as e- and m-commerce and specialty multi-brand retailers, and we are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where they are not yet sold.
·                  in fiscal 2017, we increased our penetration in the specialty-multi channel through the acquisitions of becca and too faced, and we expanded the representation of our existing brands, such as the launch of mac in ulta beauty.  in addition, we have opportunities to accelerate our growth within specialty-multi brand retailers as they open new doors.
·                  internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding retail stores operated by us and by authorized third parties, in european perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia.
·                  we seek to optimize distribution in both channels and geographies, matching each brand with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.  we focus on brand-building retail opportunities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands.  as part of this strategy, we continue to diversify our business in our travel retail channel across brands and product categories.  travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion.  at the same time it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.
25
·                  online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis and we are continuing to launch e- and m-commerce sites in new and existing markets. we are also partnering with our retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites.   we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market needs.  we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
while our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. in particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to brick-and-mortar department stores in the united states as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.  we are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism, which has particularly impacted certain tourist-driven stores in the united states.  additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east, the united kingdoms anticipated exit from the european union, geopolitical tensions and global security issues.
we believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength among our brands, product categories, channels and markets.  however, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, on our business.  we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
we navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results.  we are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.  we will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.
leading beauty forward in may 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (leading beauty forward) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  inclusive of charges recorded from inception through june 30, 2017, we expect that leading beauty forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  after its full implementation, we expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  we expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in future growth initiatives.  for additional information about leading beauty forward, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data note 8  charges associated with restructuring and other activities.
global technology infrastructure in october 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize our global technology infrastructure (gti) to fundamentally change the way we deliver information technology services internally (such initiative, the gti restructuring).  as part of the gti restructuring, we transitioned our gti from company-owned assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where we pay for services as they are used.  the implementation of the gti restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016.  for additional information about the gti restructuring, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 8  charges associated with restructuring and other activities.

strategic modernization initiative implementation we rolled out the last major wave of our strategic modernization initiative (smi) in july 2014, and most of our locations are now sap-enabled.  we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.  in connection with the july 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the smi rollout.  the negative impact on the net sales and operating results for the year ended june 30, 2015 by product category and geographic region was as follows:

the lower orders during the year ended june 30, 2015 created a favorable comparison between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 of approximately $178 million in net sales and approximately $127 million in operating results and impacted our operating margin comparisons.  we believe that the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
fiscal 2017 annual impairment testing we assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.  based on our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1, 2017, we determined that the carrying values of the rodin olio lusso and editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting units exceeded their fair values.  this determination was made based on updated long-term plans, finalized and approved in june 2017, that reflected lower sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for those brands.  as a result, a step 2 impairment assessment was performed and we recorded an impairment charge of the goodwill related to these reporting units of $28 million.  the fair values of the reporting units were based upon the average of the income approach, which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers.  as of june 30, 2017, no goodwill remained related to the rodin olio lusso reporting unit and the remaining carrying value of the goodwill related to the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit was $6 million.
we also determined that the carrying values of the rodin olio lusso and editions de parfums frédéric malle trademarks, as well as the rodin olio lusso persona and customer relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values. the fair values of the trademarks were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows.  as a result, we recognized impairment charges of $3 million for the remaining carrying values of the rodin olio lusso trademark, customer relationship and persona intangible assets.  we also recognized an impairment charge for the editions de parfums frédéric malle trademark, which was de minimis.  the remaining carrying value of this trademark was $32 million as of june 30, 2017.
the combined goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $9 million and $22 million are reflected in the skin care and fragrance product categories, respectively, and $17 million and $14 million are reflected in the americas and europe, the middle east & africa regions, respectively.

if the softness in the retail environment impacting our growth projections for the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business disruptions arise, a resulting change in the long-term plans could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the related goodwill and trademark and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.  based on the latest quantitative assessment, the fair values of all other reporting units with material goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the exception of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of too faced and becca, were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.  with regard to too faced and becca, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.

reported net sales in fiscal 2017 increased in each major product category, except hair care, and grew in each geographic region.  skin care net sales primarily benefited from higher sales of la mer products.  incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, as well as net sales increases from tom ford, estée lauder and smashbox, drove growth in the makeup product category.  our fragrance category primarily benefited from net sales increases from jo malone london.  increased net sales from our fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions of glamglow, by kilian, le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle, also contributed to growth in our skin care and fragrance categories.  the net sales decrease in our hair care category primarily reflected a difficult comparison with the prior-year period that featured greater launch activity.  each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets and in the specialty-multi and online channels.
reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, with the exception of asia/pacific.  the overall decline in the skin care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in north america, asia/pacific and travel retail.  however, this category benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly from la mer and origins.  net sales increases in product offerings by mac, smashbox, tom ford, clinique, bobbi brown and estée lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category.  our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from our luxury brands.  incremental sales from our acquisitions during fiscal 2016 and 2015 also helped drive our skin care and fragrance sales.  the net sales increase in our hair care category was driven by product offerings from aveda and bumble and bumble, as well as expanded consumer coverage.  each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, comparable door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets.
the reported net sales increases were adversely affected by approximately $187 million and $488 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  accordingly, the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2017 and 2016 impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively.

reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales from la mer, glamglow, estée lauder, bobbi brown and origins of approximately $157 million, combined, partially offset by lower net sales from clinique and mac of approximately $93 million, combined.  higher net sales from la mer were primarily due to targeted expanded consumer reach in the americas region and in our travel retail business, and the increase in net sales from glamglow reflected incremental sales from additional product assortments and targeted expanded consumer reach.  higher net sales from estée lauder were partially due to net sales growth in our travel retail business and in china resulting from higher net sales of the advanced night repair and revitalizing supreme lines of products.  net sales growth from bobbi brown was driven by new launches including instant confidence stick and extra repair nourishing milk.  the higher net sales from origins reflected net sales growth in the asia/pacific region and in our travel retail business resulting from higher net sales of toners and facial masks.
the lower net sales of clinique products primarily reflected a soft retail environment for our products, particularly in our travel retail business, asia/pacific and, to a lesser extent, the united kingdom and brick-and-mortar department stores in the united states.  the lower net sales from mac were driven by slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the united states reflecting the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
the net sales increase for skin care was adversely affected by approximately $60 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
reported skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately $163 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million. the reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from estée lauder and clinique of approximately $138 million, combined. the decrease in net sales of estée lauder and clinique products was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within asia/pacific, particularly hong kong reflecting continued retail softness.  the lower net sales from clinique also reflected decreased sales in travel retail. these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of la mer and origins products, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso, of approximately $108 million, combined.  net sales of la mer products grew in all regions, driven by the continued momentum of the fiscal 2016 launches of the renewal oil, the lifting eye serum and genaissance de la mer the serum essence and an increase in distribution in specialty-multi brand retailers and department stores.  net sales growth of origins products benefited from higher sales of facial mask products.

reported makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, as well as higher net sales from tom ford and estée lauder, of approximately $391 million, combined.  increased net sales from tom ford were driven by higher sales of lipstick and eyeshadow products, such as the tom ford soleil color collection.  increased net sales of estée lauder products were due, in part, to higher sales from the double wear line of products and the pure color franchise.
partially offsetting these increases were approximately $84 million of lower net sales of mac and clinique products, primarily reflecting slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the united states.  partially offsetting these lower net sales from mac was the net sales growth of the brand in asia/pacific and in our travel retail business.

reported makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite approximately $233 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. the increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $65 million.  the reported net sales increase primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, clinique, smashbox, tom ford and estée lauder of approximately $397 million, combined. sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as the continued broadening of the brands presence in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores and travel retail.  the higher net sales from clinique reflected incremental sales from new launches such as clinique beyond perfecting makeup products.  sales from smashbox were primarily driven by specialty multi-brand retailers, reflecting the overall strength of the makeup category in that channel.  the increase in tom ford net sales was driven by higher sales of lip color products.  net sales of estée lauder products improved partially due to higher sales from the double wear line of products and the pure color envy franchise.

reported fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our luxury brands of approximately $172 million combined.  the higher net sales from jo malone london were, in part, due to targeted expanded consumer reach in the travel retail, department store and freestanding store channels, as well as the launch of basil & neroli.  increased net sales from tom ford reflected, in part, the continued success and growth of existing fragrances such as the signature and private blend franchises.  partially offsetting the increases was approximately $33 million of lower net sales of certain estée lauder and designer fragrances.  the lower net sales of certain estée lauder fragrances were partially due to a decline in net sales of the modern muse franchise.  lower net sales from certain designer fragrances reflected the expiration of our license agreement with coach.

reported net sales in the americas increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting incremental sales, primarily in the united states, from our recent acquisitions of too faced and becca of approximately $220 million, combined.  net sales growth from certain of our brands, including tom ford, smashbox, la mer and jo malone london, also contributed to the higher net sales in the region.  higher net sales in chile and brazil contributed an additional increase of approximately $25 million, combined.  net sales in the united states were adversely impacted by slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores that particularly affected mac and our heritage brands.  this slower retail traffic reflected the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop, as well as declines in tourism attributable, in part, to the strong u.s. dollar in relation to most currencies.
reported net sales in the americas increased in fiscal 2016 despite the negative impact of approximately $101 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  net sales in the united states and canada increased approximately $191 million, combined, and reflected the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $84 million.  the increase also reflected higher makeup net sales, driven by clinique, smashbox, estée lauder and mac, as well as higher skin care and hair care net sales from la mer and aveda, respectively. also contributing were higher fragrance net sales from tom ford and jo malone london, which were more than offset by lower net sales of estée lauder fragrances.  net sales were impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the united states related primarily to mid-tier department stores that principally affected estée lauder and clinique, as well as certain mac freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease in tourism, particularly from brazilian travelers.  net sales in latin america increased approximately $6 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales in mexico and argentina, partially offset by lower sales in brazil as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $33 million.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the emerging markets of brazil and mexico had net sales increases of approximately $56 million, primarily driven by mac.

reported net sales in europe, the middle east & africa increased in fiscal 2016.  this increase includes approximately $265 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to all currencies in the region. the increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $68 million.  higher sales in our travel retail business, the united kingdom and the middle east totaled approximately $225 million, combined.  the sales growth in our travel retail business was partially driven by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders.  travel retail growth also reflected higher net sales from jo malone london, tom ford, mac and smashbox, driven in part by increased distribution and new product offerings.  higher sales in the united kingdom and the middle east were primarily due to increased net sales from estée lauder, our makeup artist brands and smashbox, reflecting the strength of our makeup category, as well as higher sales from certain of our luxury brands.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in russia and south africa of approximately $17 million, combined, driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  excluding this impact, net sales in russia and south africa increased $57 million, combined. the sales growth in russia was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands. the higher net sales in south africa were primarily driven by our makeup artist brands and certain of our luxury brands, reflecting successful in-store promotional events.

reported net sales in asia/pacific increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales in china, japan and korea of approximately $152 million, combined.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $8 million in hong kong. the higher net sales in china, led by estée lauder, la mer and mac, benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach and reflected an increase in online sales from all brands, primarily driven by marketing and promotional events.  the net sales increase in japan was primarily due to higher net sales from mac, particularly of lip products, as well as jo malone london, which benefited from an increase in tourist traffic and online growth.  the net sales growth in korea reflected higher net sales from mac, particularly of lip products and the cushion compact, la mer, which benefited from the introduction of new products, and jo malone london and tom ford, resulting from targeted expanded consumer reach.  the lower net sales in hong kong were primarily driven by the decrease in chinese consumers traveling there and changes in their spending patterns, which particularly impacted the estée lauder and clinique brands and, to a lesser extent, la mer.

fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016
as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses improved as compared to fiscal 2016, reflecting disciplined expense management across all areas and favorable mix shifts in the growth of our brands and channels.  the favorable impact of general and administrative expenses also reflected equity investment income, partially offset by transaction costs related to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.  selling expenses were favorable compared to fiscal 2016, reflecting lower demonstration costs, partially due to changes in distribution channel mix.  the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration were due to the reassessment, in june 2017, of the potential earn-out amounts related to certain of our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions.  see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 13  fair value measurements for further information regarding contingent consideration.
fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015
the lower advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 2016, as a percentage of net sales, as compared to fiscal 2015, were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as certain media formats carry different cost structures.  certain of our brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and television advertising, which carry a higher media cost.

adjusting for the impact of the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, operating expense margin in fiscal 2016 would have increased an additional 90 basis points, to 160 basis points unfavorable as compared to fiscal 2015.  this additional increase, as a percentage of net sales, was reflected in general and administrative, selling and shipping, and advertising, merchandising and sampling costs.

reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2017 were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $59 million, which had the largest impact on the europe, the middle east & africa region and the makeup product category.  operating margin in fiscal 2017 was flat as compared to fiscal 2016 as the decrease in gross margin was offset by our lower operating expense margin, as previously noted.  the change in operating margin was unfavorably impacted by charges associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately 60 basis points and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the favorable changes in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately 60 basis points.  adjusting for these items, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have increased approximately 30 basis points.

reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2016 were impacted by a favorable comparison of approximately $127 million related to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $134 million, which negatively impacted each product category and geographic region.  in addition, the operating results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities of $134 million.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders and charges associated with restructuring and other activities, operating income would have increased 1% and operating margin would have decreased 30 basis points.

charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures and to transform and modernize the companys gti.  accordingly, the following discussions of operating income by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities of $212 million, or 2% of net sales, and $134 million, or 1% of net sales, respectively.

reported operating income in asia/pacific increased in fiscal 2016, reflecting the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of $42 million.  excluding this impact, operating income decreased.  lower results in hong kong and china totaled approximately $36 million, combined.  the decline in operating results in china was also attributable to higher selling and shipping costs.  these lower results were partially offset by higher results in japan, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, australia, korea and taiwan of approximately $44 million, combined.  the improved results in australia were due to higher sales from virtually all of our brands, as well as an improvement in selling and shipping costs. the higher results in korea were primarily due to lower advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses.  the improved results from taiwan were primarily due to an increase in net sales.

provision for income taxes year ended june 30

2017   2016         2015
effective rate for income taxes           22.3   %     27.9   %     29.9   %
basis-point change from prior year        (560   )     (200   )
the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance (the china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal).  the deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in china was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.  also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2016.
the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  in addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or reflect the companys underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period.  in the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the companys results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict.  our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, the china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal, the fiscal 2015 impact of accelerated orders associated with the smi rollout, the fiscal 2015 venezuela remeasurement charge and the effects of foreign currency translation.  the tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.  certain information in the prior-year periods have been restated to conform to current period presentation.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad.  at june 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,136 million compared with $914 million at june 30, 2016.  our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
in addition, we purchase short and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.  our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.  these investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,498 million and $1,505 million at june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  from time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at june 30, 2017 include $2,376 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.
credit ratings changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility.  downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating or information.  as of august 18, 2017, our commercial paper is rated a-1 by standard & poors and p-1 by moodys, and our long-term debt is rated a+ with a stable outlook by standard & poors and a2 with a stable outlook by moodys.
debt and access to liquidity total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 45% at june 30, 2017 from 39% at june 30, 2016, primarily due to the february 2017 issuance of the 1.80% senior notes due february 7, 2020 (2020 senior notes), 3.15% senior notes due march 15, 2027 (2027 senior notes) and 4.15% senior notes due march 15, 2047 (2047 senior notes).

the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.  these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals.  the overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation, which contributed to an unfavorable comparison in certain working capital components and the increase in net earnings.  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an unfavorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and collections, and higher long-term payments related to new freestanding retail store locations, including cash payments made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial property leases.  also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of expenses.  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.
the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.  the decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected lower payments related to acquisitions.  cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian and an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 2015 acquisition.  partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the long-term investment in have & be co. ltd., the company behind the skin care brands dr. jart + and do the right thing, as well as higher capital expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.
the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 senior notes, 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 5.55% senior notes due may 15, 2017.  the increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher dividend payments.
the fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 1.70% senior notes due may 10, 2021 and additional 4.375% senior notes due june 15, 2045, as well as lower treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments.
dividends for a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30, 2017 and through august 18, 2017, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 16  common stock.
pension and post-retirement plan funding several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.  for our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (u.s. qualified plan), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  for any future contributions to the u.s. qualified plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, (erisa) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  for each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  in addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting policies and estimates.  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
for the u.s. qualified plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.  this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.  for fiscal 2017 and 2016, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the u.s. qualified plan.  in fiscal 2016, we made a discretionary cash contribution to the u.s. qualified plan of $30 million.  as we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the u.s. qualified plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2018.

commitments and contingencies certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.  these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.  since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

market risk during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we changed our market risk assessment model from a value-at-risk model to a sensitivity based model. this sensitivity analysis utilizes hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates at the end of the reporting period to express the potential future losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors.  we believe this model provides greater insight into the impact of market risk exposures on our derivative instruments.
we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  a hypothetical 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $26 million and $22 million as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.
in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.  based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by $34 million and $15 million as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  we believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30, 2017 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.  we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition.  our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
revenue recognition our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.  this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.  consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.  in addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
for a discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy, which includes information about the sales return accrual, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.  the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.  this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  in addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
for further discussion of our inventory accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
pension and other post-retirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: the u.s. qualified plan and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the u.s. qualified plan, the domestic plans); a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.  we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.  while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.

the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  for fiscal 2017, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 3.70% and 3.00% and varying rates on our international plans between .25% and 6.00%.  the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  we used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans.  for our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
for fiscal 2017, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our u.s. qualified plan and varying rates of between 1.50% and 6.00% for our international plans.  in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies.  see item 8.  financial statements and supplementary data  note 14  pension, deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.  the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.  for fiscal 2017, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $99 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $68 million.  the resulting net deferred gain of approximately $31 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 19 years.  the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was higher than expected due to the strong performance of equity assets globally and enhanced by fixed income returns in the united kingdom plan.
a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2017 pension expense:
(in millions)           25 basis-point          25 basis-point increase                decrease

discount rate               $(4                 )                  $4
expected return on assets   $(3                 )                  $3
our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  a 100 basis-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2017 would have had the following effects:
(in millions)                    100 basis-point     100 basis-point increase            decrease

effect on total service and interest costs                     $1   $(1                 )
effect on post-retirement benefit obligations                 $15   $(13                )
to determine the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 3.90% and 3.40% for the u.s. qualified plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .50% and 6.75%.  we are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the u.s. qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 1.75% and 6.75%.  the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2017 will result in a decrease in pension expense of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2018.
goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
when testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. for fiscal 2017 and 2016, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. for our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those acquired during and subsequent to fiscal 2015, a quantitative assessment was performed.  we engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.  with regard to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of becca and too faced, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.

for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  as of june 30, 2017, we have net deferred tax assets of $322 million.  the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $42 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.
we provide tax reserves for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.
for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
quantitative analysis during the three-year period ended june 30, 2017, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.

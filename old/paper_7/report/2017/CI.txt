management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the "risk factors" contained in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
in this md&a, our consolidated measures "operating revenues" and "adjusted income from operations" are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures "total revenues" and "shareholders' net income."
we define operating revenues as total revenues excluding realized investment results. we exclude realized investment results from this measure because our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment. as a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past or future underlying performance of our businesses.
we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders' net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. income or expense amounts are excluded from adjusted income from operations for the following reasons:

realized investment results are excluded because, as noted above, our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment.

net amortization of other intangible assets is excluded because it relates to costs incurred for acquisitions and, as a result, it does not relate to the core performance of the company's business operations. in 2015, the amortization amount was net of a bargain purchase gain on an acquisition.

special items are excluded because management believes they are not representative of the underlying results of operations. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for descriptions of special items.

the charts on the following pages provide a comparison of our 2017 and 2016 results compared with each prior year.
2017 versus 2016 and 2016 versus 2015  increases in both 2017 and 2016 primarily reflected higher operating revenues driven by business growth as discussed further below.
2017 versus 2016  increase driven by business growth in global health care and global supplemental benefits.
2016 versus 2015  increase resulted from business growth across all of our ongoing reportable segments.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2017 versus 2016  increase due to higher adjusted income from operations across our reporting segments. debt extinguishment costs and charges resulting from u.s. tax reform, both reported as special items in
2017, partially offset these increases.
2016 versus 2015  decrease due to lower adjusted income from operations, primarily in the group disability and life segment. increased special item charges in 2016 (primarily higher transaction costs and the 2016 risk corridor allowance) also contributed to the decline.
2017 versus 2016  increase driven by higher earnings in each of our ongoing reportable segments. these increases were primarily a result of customer growth in global health care and global supplemental benefits and increased specialty contributions in global health care. improved claim experience in group disability and life also contributed to the increase.
2016 versus 2015  decrease was a result of significantly lower earnings in group disability and life reflecting unfavorable claim experience. costs related to the government segment's response to the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") audit also contributed to the decline. increased earnings contributions in global supplemental benefits and the commercial segment partially offset those unfavorable impacts.

2017 versus 2016 and 2016 versus 2015  increases in both 2017 and 2016 reflected growth in targeted markets for our commercial segment. in 2017, these favorable effects were partially offset by expected disenrollment in the government segment.

key developments

u.s. tax reform legislation major u.s. tax reform legislation was signed into law on december 22, 2017. the legislation is highlighted by a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from the current 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. as further described on page 39 of this form 10-k, we expect a significant decline in our effective tax rate beginning in 2018 as a result of the rate reduction. the remaining provisions of the law, most of which take effect on january 1, 2018, are not expected to have a material impact on the company's results of operations beginning in 2018.
we recorded additional tax expense of $232 million in 2017 resulting from this legislation, comprised of $144 million due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and $88 million due to the assessment of u.s. taxes related to the company's accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. the legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years and we expect to adopt this election. both the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the taxes on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings are considered provisional as certain adjustments used to calculate the tax at year-end were based on estimates.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also as a result of tax reform, the company recorded a reduction in operating expenses of $56 million ($36 million after-tax) reflecting a decrease in a liability to reimburse a reinsurer for taxes related to a block of business sold through reinsurance. an offsetting tax effect is included in the $144 million charge discussed above, resulting in no after-tax effect for this item.

termination of proposed merger with anthem, inc.
on may 12, 2017, we announced that the merger agreement between cigna and anthem, inc. had been terminated.


revenues.  the components of revenue changes are discussed further below:
premiums. the increase in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to customer growth in the commercial segment and in global supplemental benefits. expected decreases in government segment premiums due to medicare disenrollment partially offset these increases. in 2016, premiums increased compared with 2015, reflecting customer growth in global health care, global supplemental benefits as well as group disability and life. rate actions in our commercial health care businesses consistent with medical cost trend also contributed to these increases.
fees and other revenues. the increases in both 2017 and 2016
compared with each prior year primarily reflected growth from specialty products offered through our global health care segment and an increased customer base for our administrative services only business.
net investment income increased in 2017 compared with 2016
driven by growth in average invested assets partially offset by lower yields. in 2016, net investment income decreased slightly compared with 2015, as lower investment yields in the protracted low interest rate environment were partially offset by higher average invested assets. unfavorable foreign currency effects also contributed to the declines in 2016.
mail order pharmacy revenues were flat in 2017 compared with
2016, reflecting increased commercial customers, specialty medication prices and utilization (e.g., certain injectables) offset by lower oral medication volumes and medicare customers. in 2016, mail order pharmacy revenues increased compared with 2015, driven by greater volume, primarily for specialty medications due to our higher customer base and increased utilization. in each period, changes in mail order pharmacy costs were driven by the same factors as mail order pharmacy revenues.
realized investment results increased in 2017 compared with
2016 primarily due to higher gains on sales of alternative and real estate investments as well as lower impairment losses. realized investment results increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to significantly lower impairment losses.

global health care medical costs.  the increases in 2017 and 2016 compared with each prior year resulted primarily from customer growth in our commercial health care businesses and medical cost trend. in 2017, the impact of medicare disenrollment partially offset these effects.

other benefit expenses  declined slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 as improvements in our disability and life claims experience were largely offset by customer growth in global supplemental benefits. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by unfavorable disability and life claim experience due primarily to changes in the disability claims management process in 2016 and elevated life claims during the second quarter of 2016. business growth in our group disability and life and global supplemental benefits segments also contributed to the 2016 increase.

other operating expenses.  in 2017, the increase in other operating expenses compared with 2016 reflected debt extinguishment costs, a long-term care guaranty fund assessment and higher volume-based expenses reflecting business growth. these increases were offset by the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and a reduction in costs related to our cms audit response. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to costs associated with our cms audit response, business growth, strategic investment across our segments and special item charges including transaction-related costs and a risk corridor allowance described in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.

amortization of other acquired intangible assets, net.  the decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by the expected continuing decline in amortization from our 2012 acquisition of healthspring, inc. the increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by the absence of the $23 million bargain purchase gain recorded in 2015 for an acquisition. this factor was partially offset by the decline in our healthspring, inc. amortization.

the consolidated effective tax rate  was flat in 2017 compared with 2016. the unfavorable impact of additional tax expense associated with the recently enacted u.s. tax reform legislation was offset by the favorable effects of a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and an incremental tax benefit associated with previously non-deductible transaction-related costs. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the increase in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared with 2015 was largely driven by an increase in non-tax deductible transaction-related costs reported in 2016, partially offset by the tax benefits on stock compensation recognized in net income as a result of our early adoption of accounting standard update ("asu") 2016-09.
we expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to decrease significantly from 2017 as a result of enactment of the u.s. tax reform legislation. this favorable effect will be partially offset by the resumption of the health insurance industry tax.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations health care industry developments and other matters affecting our global health care segment

the "regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act (the "aca") provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care business, including regulations issued by cms and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). in october 2017, president trump issued an executive order that could result in a variety of changes to the individual and group health insurance markets when implemented. at this time, we are unable to determine the effect, if any, of these changes on our business or results of operations. in addition, the president ordered the immediate cessation of cost sharing reduction subsidy payments to insurers. discussions on the aca continue in the u.s. congress. the table presented below provides an update of the impact of these items and other matters affecting our global health care segment as of december 31, 2017.
item                                    description medicare advantage ("ma")               cms sanctions: on june 16, 2017, the company received notification from cms that the marketing and enrollment sanctions imposed by cms on january 21, 2016 had been lifted.
cigna has resumed marketing of its medicare advantage-prescription drug and medicare part d plans and began enrolling beneficiaries with effective dates beginning july 1, 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, medicare enrollment and consolidated revenues were materially impacted due to our inability to participate in 2017 annual enrollment. however, 2017 shareholders' net income was not materially affected because the margin impact of the revenue loss was offset by lower operating expenses due to reduced remediation costs and other operational efficiencies that improved 2017 results. the impact of disenrollment was not material to 2016 consolidated revenues or earnings.
medicare star quality ratings ("star ratings"): medicare advantage plans must have a star rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. we expect that approximately 60% of our medicare advantage customers will be in a four star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2018. in october 2017, cms announced star ratings for plans for the 2019 payment year. we expect that approximately 40% of our medicare advantage customers will be in a four star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2019. management continues to evaluate various actions to improve the company's star ratings.
2018 and 2019 ma rates: final ma reimbursement rates for 2018 were published by cms in april 2017.
preliminary ma reimbursement rates for 2019 were published by cms in february 2018. we expect these changes in rates to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2018 and 2019.
aca taxes and fees                      health insurance industry tax: federal legislation imposed a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax for 2017 and 2019. the industry tax is being assessed in 2018 and, under
 industry tax                          current law, will return again in 2020 and beyond. for 2017, our premium rates reflected the moratorium and we would expect our target pricing actions to reflect the moratorium in 2019. the amount of the tax was approximately $310 million in both 2016 and 2015 ($170 million for commercial and $140 million for government in each year).
the industry tax for cigna in 2018 is expected to approximate $390 million ($260 million for commercial and $130 million for government). for our commercial business, the fee is reflected in our 2018 premium rates, and is expected to result in an immaterial effect on shareholders' net income. for our medicare business, we anticipate that the earnings impact of the tax will be more significant than in our commercial business. however, we expect to offset its earnings impact in 2018 with benefit and pricing changes as well as growth. because this tax is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, it will negatively impact our effective tax rate in 2018.
 reinsurance fee                       reinsurance fee: this fee was applicable only from 2014 through 2016. for our insured business, the amount of the fee was approximately $45 million in 2016 and $70 million in 2015.
public health exchanges                 market participation: for 2017, we offered individual coverage on seven public health insurance exchanges in the following states: colorado, illinois, maryland, missouri, north carolina, tennessee and virginia. for 2018, we are offering individual coverage on the same exchanges with the exception of maryland.
cost sharing reduction subsidies: the aca provides for cost sharing reductions that lower the amount that qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. the federal government has provided funding for the cost sharing reduction subsidies to the qualifying customer's insurer. in october 2017, the trump administration stopped payment of these subsidies to insurers. the attorneys general of 18 states and the district of columbia have sued the trump administration, seeking to require the administration to continue paying these subsidies. while the litigation is at a preliminary stage, on october 25, 2017, the court denied the request of the attorneys general for an injunction, allowing the government to cease providing the cost sharing reduction payments to insurers during the pendency of the matter. we will continue to monitor developments as the case proceeds. the impact of suspending cost sharing reduction subsidies was not material to 2017 consolidated earnings. our pricing actions for the 2018 plan year have anticipated that the government would no longer pay for these subsidies, and we expect the impact on our future results of operations to be immaterial.
individual mandate repeal: the u.s. tax reform legislation also repealed the penalty charged to individuals without health insurance (known as the "individual mandate") effective january 1, 2019. while the impact on future premium rates and enrollment in the individual market is uncertain, we expect this repeal to have an immaterial impact on our future results of operations.

(1)
risk adjustment and risk corridor receivables, net of allowances, are reported in premiums, accounts and notes receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. risk adjustment receivables totaled $69 million as of december 31, 2017 and $52 million as of december 31, 2016.
(2)
risk adjustment payables are reported in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. risk adjustment payables totaled $250 million as of december 31, 2017 and $51 million as of december 31, 2016.
(3)
reinsurance receivables are reported in reinsurance recoverables.
in 2016, we recorded an allowance for the balance of our risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large risk corridor program deficit. as of december 31, 2017, we continued to hold an allowance for the balance of our risk corridor receivable of $109 million based on the current status of court decisions. however, we continue to believe that the government has a binding obligation to satisfy the risk corridor receivable.

liquidity

we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:
 medical costs and benefit payments to policyholders;  expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs; and  income taxes.
our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by:
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;  using cash flows from operating activities;
 matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;  selling investments; and  borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:
 debt service and dividend payments to shareholders;  pension plan funding; and  repurchases of common stock.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;  collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
 using proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and  borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
cash flows for the years ended december 31, were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities (1)(2)       $4,086            $4,026            $2,933
net cash (used in) investing activities (2)            $(1,703)          $(2,574)          $(1,736)
net cash (used in) financing activities (1)            $(2,651)          $(225)            $(609)
(1)
as required in adopting asu 2016-09 in 2016, we retrospectively reclassified $79 million of cash payments from operating to financing activities in 2015. these payments were related to employee tax obligations associated with stock compensation. the comparable amounts reported in financing activities were $61 million in 2017 and $72 million in 2016.
(2)
as required in adopting asu 2016-15 in 2016, the company retrospectively reclassified cash distributions from partnership earnings of $137 million from investing to operating activities in 2015. the comparable amounts reported in operating activities were $161 million in 2017 and $144 million in 2016.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, mail order pharmacy, other revenues, investment income, taxes, benefits and expenses. because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash, and because cash transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in shareholders' net income, cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders' net income.
cash flows from operating activities increased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by lower receipts from medicare part d and medicare advantage programs and a voluntary pension contribution of $150 million in 2017.
cash flows from operating activities increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to higher receipts from medicare part d and medicare advantage programs.
investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment including capitalized software, as well as cash used to acquire businesses.
cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to lower net investment purchases. in 2017, more cash was deployed to share repurchase than investment purchases in accordance with our capital management strategy discussed in the below "capital resources" section of this md&a.
cash used in investing activities increased in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher purchases of fixed maturity investments.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re-payment of debt at the parent company level, proceeds on the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises, and stock repurchases. in addition, the subsidiaries report deposits to and withdrawals from investment contract liabilities (including universal life insurance liabilities) because such liabilities are considered financing activities with policyholders.
cash used in financing activities increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases. the 2017 proceeds from the company's $1.6 billion debt issuance were largely offset by $1.3 billion paid to extinguish $1.0 billion of debt, as well as repaying maturing debt in the first quarter of 2017.
cash used in financing activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to lower share repurchases offset by lower proceeds from employees' exercise of stock options.
share repurchase we maintain a share repurchase program, authorized by our board of directors. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
in 2017, we repurchased 15.7 million shares for $2.8 billion. from january 1, 2018 through january 31, 2018 we repurchased 1.2 million shares for approximately $260 million. we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $110 million in 2016 and 5.5 million shares for $683 million in 2015.
interest expense

interest expense on long-term debt, short-term debt and capital leases was as follows:

interest expense       $243          $251          $252
interest expense reported above excluded losses on the early extinguishment of debt.
the weighted average interest rate for outstanding short-term debt (primarily commercial paper) was 1.63% as of december 31, 2017. there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2016.
capital resources

our capital resources (primarily retained earnings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we prioritize our use of capital resources to:

provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations;

consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and

return capital to investors through share repurchase.
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions. extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce our ability to issue debt or equity securities.
liquidity and capital resources outlook

at december 31, 2017, there was approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable investments available at the parent company level. in 2018, the parent company's combined cash obligations are expected to approximate $480 million for repayment of debt, interest and dividends. we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above, based on the parent company's current cash position and current projections for subsidiary dividends. in addition, we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy.
our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings, or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section of this form 10-k. in those cases, we expect to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures, including intercompany borrowings. the parent company may borrow up to $1.1 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without additional state approval. we have additional liquidity available through short-term commercial paper borrowings and a committed $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the revolving credit and letter of credit agreement is subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant. as of december 31, 2017, we have $9.3 billion of maximum borrowing capacity in the debt leverage covenant, in addition to the $5.4 billion of debt outstanding. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the credit facility.
though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds.
the state of illinois continues to experience financial difficulties; however, some of their immediate cash flow constraints were alleviated by a bond offering issued during the fourth quarter of 2017. as a result, we have collected most of the receivables due as of december 31, 2017. the remaining amount due to us from the state of illinois under our commercial and medicaid contracts as of december 31, 2017 was immaterial. as of december 31, 2017, all of our contracts with the state of illinois had been terminated.
we continue to maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations. these undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the united states predominantly in support of the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations as well as to support growth initiatives overseas. as a result of the u.s. tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017, we recorded additional u.s. taxes of $88 million related to these undistributed earnings. the legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years. we expect to adopt that election.
unfunded pension plan liability.   as of december 31, 2017, our unfunded pension liability was $688 million, reflecting a decrease of $223 million from december 31, 2016. the decrease in the unfunded liability reflected strong investment asset returns and a contribution of $150 million in 2017, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in discount rates of approximately 45 basis points. no contributions are required in 2018 under the pension protection act of 2006. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.
guarantees and contractual obligations

we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. see the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a beginning on page 41 for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations, as of december 31, 2017, are estimated to be as follows:


insurance liabilities.  excluded from the table above are $5 billion of insurance liabilities associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses, as well as the reinsured workers' compensation, personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $2 billion in future policy benefits) as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows. excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $21 billion recorded on the balance sheet because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above as actual results differ from those assumed.
contractholder deposit funds: see note 2(f) to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability. expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
future policy benefits, global health care medical costs payable and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see notes 2(g), 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted. the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb," reported in future policy benefits) do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.

short-term debt represents current maturities of long-term debt and related interest payments, and current obligations under capital leases.

long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments. capital leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage, servers and equipment.

other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") contracts (without considering any related reinsurance arrangements), pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts, and reinsurance liabilities. these items are presented in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. estimated payments of $68 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. we do not expect to make any additional contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2018. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2018 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
off-balance sheet:

purchase obligations.   as of december 31, 2017, purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments as follows:

fixed maturities                                               $118
commercial mortgage loans                                      21
limited liability entities (other long-term investments)             1,178
total investment commitments                                         1,317
future service commitments                                             489
total purchase obligations                                     $1,806
see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support. we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements, but do not anticipate doing so at this time. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
operating leases.   for additional information, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.
guarantees

we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees.
critical accounting estimates

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the table below presents the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for the assessments of impairment for goodwill and fixed maturities carried at a fair value below cost. the tax rate used to calculate the after-tax impact of assumption changes is based on the new corporate income tax rate discussed in the "key developments" section of this md&a.
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies.

goodwill at the acquisition date, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets. we completed our annual evaluations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                if we do not achieve our earnings objectives or the cost of capital rises significantly, the assumptions and estimates underlying these impairment evaluations could be adversely affected and result in future impairment charges that would negatively of goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of 2017. these evaluations were performed at the reporting unit level, based on discounted cash flow analyses or market data. the evaluations indicated that no impairment was required. fair values of reporting units are estimated using models and assumptions that we believe a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. the       impact our operating results. based on our most recent evaluations, the fair value estimates of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by adequate margins.
significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. a range of discount rates is used, corresponding with the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that                                                                                                                                                                                future changes in the funding for our medicare programs by the federal government could materially reduce revenues and profitability in our government reporting unit and used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within the reporting unit. projections of future cash flows are consistent with our annual planning process for revenues, claims, operating expenses,                                                                                                                                                                               have a significant impact on its fair value.
taxes, capital levels and long-term growth rates. in addition to these assumptions, we consider market data to evaluate the fair value of each reporting unit.
in our government operating segment we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services, including medicare advantage plans and medicare-approved prescription drug plans. estimated future cash flows for this reporting unit's business incorporate the potential effects of medicare advantage reimbursement rates for 2018 and beyond as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this md&amp;a. revenues from the medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through cms. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal level and general political issues and priorities.
goodwill as of december 31 was as follows (in millions):
 2017  $6,164
 2016  $5,980
see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill.
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities  pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid (attributed to employee service to date) net of the fair value of plan assets. the accrued pension benefit liability as of                                                                                                                                                                                          the discount rate is typically the most significant assumption in measuring the pension liability. we develop the discount rate by applying actual annualized yields at various durations from a discount rate curve constructed from high quality december 31 was as follows (in millions):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              corporate bonds. based on our historical experience, we believe that a 50 basis point change in the discount rate and a 10% decline in plan assets are reasonably possible outcomes.

valuation of fixed maturity investments most fixed maturities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date. determining fair value for a financial instrument requires management judgment. the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in       typically, the most significant input in the measurement of fair value is the market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows of the instrument. such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over the markets. financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. conversely, private placements including more complex                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          comparable u.s. treasury securities, based on the credit quality, industry and structure of the asset. if the interest rates used to calculate fair value increased by 100
securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. there may be a number of alternative inputs to select based on an                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               basis points, the fair value of the total fixed maturity portfolio of $23 billion would decrease by approximately $1.5 billion, resulting in an after-tax decrease to shareholders' equity of approximately $0.9 billion.
understanding of the issuer, the structure of the security and overall market conditions. in addition, these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions. approximately two-thirds of our fixed maturities are public securities, and one-third are private placement securities. see notes 10 and 11(a) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our fair value measurements, the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates and our accounting policy regarding unrealized appreciation on fixed maturities.

segment reporting

the following section of this md&a discusses the results of each of our reporting segments. in these segment discussions, we present "operating revenues," defined as total revenues excluding realized investment results and "adjusted income from operations," defined as shareholders' net income excluding after-tax realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted income from operations. see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics.
in these segment discussions, we also present "adjusted margin," defined as adjusted income from operations divided by operating revenues.
see the md&a executive overview beginning on page 35 for summarized financial results of each of our reporting segments.
global health care segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction above, the performance of the global health care segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

customer growth;

sales of specialty products;

medical costs as a percentage of premiums (medical care ratio or "mcr") for our commercial and government businesses; and

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues (operating expense ratio).

2017 versus 2016

operating revenues.   the increase was primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk business, partially offset by lower customer enrollment in our government segment.
adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting higher earnings in both our commercial and government operating segments. the increase in the commercial segment reflects customer growth including increased contributions from our specialty products and favorable claim experience in our u.s. individual business. the government segment's earnings growth reflects lower operating expenses related to the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and our 2016 cms audit response, partially offset by lower customer enrollment. adjusted income from operations included favorable after-tax prior year reserve development of $112 million for 2017; prior year reserve development in 2016 was not material.
medical care ratios.   the commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting the 2017 moratorium on the health insurance industry tax, offset by improved performance in our u.s. individual business and favorable prior year reserve development.
the government medical care ratio decreased slightly, reflecting increased premium rates and favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher medical costs.
operating expense ratio.   the decrease was primarily due to the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and lower costs related to our 2016 cms audit response.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues.   the increase in operating revenues was due to growth in our commercial segment primarily from increased specialty revenues and growth in medicare advantage customer volumes. higher premium rates for most products (primarily to recover underlying medical cost trend) also contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by lower customer volumes in our medicare part d and u.s. individual businesses.
adjusted income from operations was flat, reflecting earnings growth in our commercial segment, primarily due to increased contributions from specialty products partially offset by lower margins in our u.s. individual business. this increase was offset by lower earnings in our government segment primarily driven by costs related to our cms audit response.
medical care ratios.   the commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting a less favorable medical care ratio in our stop loss business, lower premium due to the anticipated reduction of the aca mandated fees in 2017 and less favorable prior year reserve development.
the government medical care ratio increased slightly, reflecting higher medical costs in our medicaid business and less favorable prior year development, mostly offset by improvements in the medicare part d business.
operating expense ratio.   the operating expense ratio increased slightly, reflecting costs related to our cms audit response. excluding those costs, the operating expense ratio decreased, reflecting higher revenue and operating efficiencies, partially offset by business initiative investments.
other items affecting health care results global health care medical costs payable medical costs payable was higher as of december 31, 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk businesses and medical cost trend across all businesses. medical costs payable was higher as of december 31, 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to medical cost trend across all businesses and customer growth in our commercial group business. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medical customers a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria:

is covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us;

has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or

has medical claims that are administered by us.
our medical customer base increased as of december 31, 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting growth across our commercial market segments, partially offset by declines in our medicare advantage business. our medical customer base increased as of december 31, 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by growth in our middle market, select and international market segments.
global supplemental benefits segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the global supplemental benefits segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio);

operating expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of operating revenues (expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio); and

the impact of foreign currency movements.
throughout this discussion and the table presented below, prior period currency adjusted income from operations and operating revenues are calculated by applying the current period's exchange rates to reported results in the prior period. a strengthening u.s. dollar against foreign currencies decreases these measures, while a weakening u.s. dollar produces the opposite effect.

2017 versus 2016

operating revenues increased primarily due to business growth, particularly in the united states and south korea, and the favorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in the south korean won.
adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting business growth, primarily in south korea and china, and lower acquisition cost ratios.
the segment's loss ratio decreased, primarily due to favorable claims experience, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with higher loss ratios.
the acquisition cost ratio decreased due to lower spending in certain markets and a shift toward higher premium markets with lower acquisition costs, primarily in south korea and the united states.
the decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by strong expense management.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues were higher primarily due to new sales, particularly in south korea and the united states, reflecting both customer growth and sales of higher premium products. these higher premiums were partially offset by lower persistency in the u.k. and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in south korea and the u.k.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted income from operations increased primarily due to business growth, largely in south korea, and lower acquisition and operating cost ratios. these factors were partially offset by higher income taxes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in south korea.
the segment's loss ratio was flat, reflecting favorable claims in south korea, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with higher loss ratios.
the  acquisition cost ratio decreased due to a shift toward higher premium products with lower acquisition costs primarily in south korea and the united states.
the decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by operating efficiencies.
other items affecting global supplemental benefits results south korea is the single largest geographic market for our global supplemental benefits segment. south korea generated 51% of the segment's operating revenues and 89% of the segment's adjusted income from operations in 2017. in 2017, our global supplemental benefits segment operations in south korea represented 5% of our consolidated operating revenues and 12% of consolidated adjusted income from operations.
as a global company, our business is exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. we continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of tensions in the korean peninsula.
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect the reported results of the global supplemental benefits segment.
group disability and life segment

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the group disability and life segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. the key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

net investment income;

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio); and

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues excluding net investment income (expense ratio).

disability:   we implemented modifications to our disability claims management process in the first quarter of 2016 to drive improved quality and consistency. these modifications extended the claims processing cycle and lowered the disability claim resolution rate. as our modified disability claims management process continued to mature during the latter half of 2016, our claim resolution rate significantly improved and operational margins normalized over the course of 2017.
life:   we experienced a period of elevated life claims in the second quarter of 2016, driven by substantially higher new claim incidence and sizes, both of which have normalized in subsequent periods.
2017 versus 2016

operating revenues were relatively flat in 2017 compared with 2016 with higher investment income driven by higher asset levels offset by cancelations in non-core products.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted income from operations increased in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting lower disability new claim incidence and a higher resolution rate as modifications to the disability claims management process discussed above continued to mature. in addition, life claims have returned to normal levels after a period of significantly elevated claims and a $17 million after-tax unfavorable reserve review, both in the second quarter of 2016.
the loss ratio decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to improvement in the disability claim resolution rate as noted above, lower disability new claim incidence and significantly improved life claims experience.
operating expense ratio.   the 2017 operating expense ratio increased compared with 2016 due to higher overhead costs.
2016 versus 2015

operating revenues.   premiums and fees increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to new business growth from disability and life sales. net investment income also increased primarily due to higher average assets partially offset by lower yields.
adjusted income from operations.   results decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to unfavorable disability and life claims experience as well as the absence of favorable reserve reviews and a higher operating expense ratio. results in 2016 included the unfavorable impact of reserve reviews of $18 million after-tax compared with a favorable impact of $55 million after-tax in 2015.
the loss ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to lower claim resolutions in disability, higher life claim incidence and sizes in the second quarter of 2016, and the unfavorable impact of reserve reviews as discussed above.
operating expense ratio.   the operating expense ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflecting higher disability claim management costs.
other operations

as described in the segment reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the other operations segment is measured using adjusted income from operations. cigna's corporate-owned life insurance ("coli") business contributes the majority of earnings in other operations. cigna's other operations segment also includes the results from the run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses, as well as the remaining deferred gains recognized from the sale of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.

fixed maturities

investments in fixed maturities include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities, mortgage and other asset-backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor. these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on our balance sheet. additional information regarding valuation methodologies, key inputs and controls is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. more detailed information about fixed maturities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
the following table reflects our fixed maturity portfolio by type of issuer as of december 31, 2017 and 2016.

federal government and agency         $779               $877

total                                 $23,138            $20,961
the fixed maturity portfolio increased $2.2 billion during the 12 months ended december 31, 2017, primarily reflecting an increase in investable funds. as of december 31, 2017, $20.5 billion, or 89%, of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent), and the remaining $2.6 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy.
state and local government.   our investment in state and local government securities, with an average quality rating of aa2, was diversified by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than $35 million as of december 31, 2017. we assess each issuer's credit quality based on a fundamental analysis of underlying financial information and do not rely solely on statistical rating organizations or monoline insurer guarantees.
foreign government.   we invested in high quality foreign government obligations with an average quality rating of aa3 as of december 31, 2017. these investments were concentrated in asia, primarily south korea, consistent with the geographic locations of our international business operations. foreign government obligations also included $243 million of investments in european sovereign debt, none of which are in countries with significant political or economic concerns such as portugal, italy, ireland, greece, spain and turkey.
corporate.   as of december 31, 2017, corporate fixed maturities included the following:

private placement investments were $6 billion. these investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer, diversify investments by industry and issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.

investments in companies that are domiciled or have significant business interests in italy, ireland, spain and turkey were $400 million. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by industry sector, including less than 2% invested in financial institutions.

investments in the energy and natural gas sector were $1.8 billion with gross unrealized losses of $9 million. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by issuer with no single exposure greater than $65 million.

retail sector fixed maturity investments were approximately $460 million with gross unrealized losses of $3 million. these investments had an average quality rating of baa2 and were diversified across approximately 40 issuers with no exposure exceeding $50 million.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to amounts classified in fixed maturities on our consolidated balance sheets, we operate an insurance joint venture in china in which we have a 50% ownership interest. we account for this joint venture on the equity basis of accounting and report it in other assets, including other intangibles. this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately $4.9 billion supporting this business that is primarily invested in local chinese corporate and government fixed maturities. there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31, 2017.
equity securities

as of december 31, 2017, approximately $400 million in equity securities were invested in an exchange traded fund ("etf") as part of a program to invest available cash in high quality and liquid assets. the underlying assets of the etf are primarily u.s. investment grade corporate bonds and there was a gross unrealized gain of $10 million as of december 31, 2017 due to a decrease in market yields since purchase.
commercial mortgage loans

our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.
we completed the annual in-depth review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2017. the results of the 2017 review were in line with the prior year and confirmed the strength of the overall portfolio. for further discussion of the results of this review and changes in key loan metrics, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for well-leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics. as of december 31, 2017, we had $135 million of commercial mortgage loans in the retail sector for various shopping centers in the united states. the loan-to-value ratio for these loans was 49%, and the debt service coverage ratio was 2.15. all of these loans are current.
as of december 31, 2017, the $1.8 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 60 loans that are all in good standing. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.
other long-term investments

other long-term investments of $1.5 billion included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 125 separate partnerships, and approximately 60 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the funds' underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type, and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeded 4% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
problem and potential problem investments

"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment is more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems. the characteristics management considers include, but are not limited to, the following:

request from the borrower for restructuring;

principal or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60 days;

downgrade in credit rating;

collateral losses on asset-backed securities; and

for commercial mortgages, deterioration of debt service coverage below 1.0 or value declines resulting in estimated loan-to-value ratios increasing to 100% or more.
we recognize interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment. the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with their original terms was not significant for 2017 or 2016.

problem and potential problem investments decreased by $42 million since december 31, 2016 primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of problem bonds and mortgage loans.
investment outlook

although financial markets in the united states remained stable during 2017, we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic trends and their potential impact to our investment portfolio. certain sectors, such as retail, energy and natural gas have experienced stress and volatility and we expect that to continue. see the fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loan sections of this md&a for further information on our investments in these sectors. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
market risk

financial instruments

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. consistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments:

changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;

changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and

changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities. because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:

interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return.

foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, euro, taiwan dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, and british pound. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:

investment/liability matching.  we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.

use of local currencies for foreign operations.  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. while this technique does not reduce foreign currency exposure on our net assets, it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets.

use of derivatives.  we use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks.
see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of market fluctuations

the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including:

a hypothetical increase in market interest rates, primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by liabilities for long-term, largely fixed-rate debt; and

a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, primarily for financial instruments held by foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency.
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of our financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:
loss in fair value market scenario for certain non-insurance financial instruments (in billions)       2017               2016
100 basis point increase in interest rates                                          $1.2               $1.0
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies                              $0.5               $0.4
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling. the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december 31, 2017 was greater than that at december 31, 2016 reflecting increased purchases of fixed maturities partially offset by additional issuances of long-term debt.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as fixed maturities, cash, and cash equivalents, that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities. the effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies at december 31, 2017 was greater than that effect at december 31, 2016 due to increased amounts of investments that are primarily denominated in the south korean won.

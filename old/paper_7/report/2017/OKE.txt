item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with part i, item 1, business, our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
recent developments please refer to the "financial results and operating information" and "liquidity and capital resources" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report for additional information.
merger transaction - on june 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of oneok partners that we did not already own at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.985 of a share of our common stock for each oneok partners common unit. we issued 168.9 million shares of our common stock to third-party common unitholders of oneok partners in exchange for all of the 171.5 million outstanding common units of oneok partners that we previously did not own. as a result of the completion of the merger transaction, common units of oneok partners are no longer publicly traded. the change in our ownership interest resulting from the merger transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of income.
business update and market conditions - we operate primarily fee-based businesses in each of our three reportable segments. our consolidated earnings were approximately 90 percent fee-based in 2017, and we expect the same for 2018. in 2017, our natural gas gathering and processing segment's fee revenues averaged 86 cents per mmbtu, compared with an average of 76 cents and 44 cents per mmbtu in the same periods in 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our contract restructuring efforts to mitigate commodity price risk and increasing volumes on those contracts with higher contracted fees.

volumes gathered and processed increased across our asset footprint in our natural gas gathering and processing segment in 2017, compared with 2016, as producers experienced improved drilling economics, continued improvements in production due to enhanced completion techniques and more efficient drilling rigs. we connected six third-party natural gas processing plants in our natural gas liquids segment in 2017, which, along with increased supply and ethane recovery, contributed to higher gathered ngl volumes in 2017, compared with 2016. we expect additional ngl volume growth as these plants continue to increase production and recently announced plant connections come online. our fee-based transportation services in our natural gas pipelines segment increased in 2017, compared with 2016, due primarily to higher firm transportation capacity contracted from our westex pipeline expansion.
growth projects - increased producer activity and volume growth across our assets have increased demand for midstream infrastructure. we are responding to this growing demand by constructing assets to meet the needs of natural gas processors and producers across our asset footprint, including the williston, dj, permian and powder river basins and the stack and scoop areas. since june 2017, we have announced approximately $4.2 billion of additional growth projects supported by long-term primarily fee-based contracts, minimum volume commitments and acreage dedications to serve the expected growth and needs of natural gas processors and producers. these projects are outlined in the table below:

ethane opportunity - ethane rejection levels across our system averaged more than 150 mbbl/d in 2017, which is slightly lower than 2016 despite an increase in overall ngl supply volumes. we expect ethane rejection on our system to decrease to approximately 70 mbbl/d by the end of 2018, initially in regions closest to market centers such as the permian basin and mid-continent region, as ethylene producers complete their expansion projects and ngl exporters increase their export volumes. we expect this increase in ethane recovery to have a favorable impact on our financial results.
income taxes - the tax cuts and jobs act makes extensive changes to the u.s. tax laws and includes provisions that, beginning in 2018, reduce the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, increase expensing for capital investment, limit the interest deduction, and limit the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income. we consider the aggregate of these changes as positive to our business and continue to expect that we will not pay federal cash income taxes through at least 2021. as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, we recorded a one-time noncash charge to net income through income tax expense of $141.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017, related to revaluation of our deferred tax balances and a valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
the tax cuts and jobs act may also impact future tariff rates charged on our regulated pipelines. the tariff rates charged on substantially all of our regulated pipelines have been established through shipper specific negotiation, discounts and negotiated settlements with rate moratoriums, which do not ascribe any specific cost of service elements, including income taxes. as such, we expect future tariff rate changes, if any, related to the change in u.s. corporate tax rate to be established prospectively over time on a similar negotiated basis. if in the future the ferc or other regulatory bodies were to require a refund of previously collected amounts on our regulated pipelines, then we may record a regulatory liability through a one-time charge to expense. for more information, see note m in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
equity issuances - in january 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 21.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $54.50 per share, generating net proceeds of $1.2 billion. we used the net proceeds from this offering to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, which included repaying a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. we have satisfied our expected equity financing needs through 2018 and well into 2019.
in july 2017, we established an "at-the-market" equity program for the offer and sale from time to time of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. the program allows us to offer and sell our common stock at prices we deem appropriate through a sales agent. sales of our common stock may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the nyse, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between us and the sales agent. we are under no obligation to offer and sell common stock under the program. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold 8.4 million shares of common stock through our "at-the-market" equity program that resulted in net proceeds of $448.3 million.
dividends - during 2017, we paid dividends totaling $2.72 per share, an increase of 11 percent from the $2.46 per share paid in 2016. in february 2018, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share ($3.08 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 25 percent compared with the same period in the prior year. we expect 85 to 95 percent of our 2018 dividend payments to investors to be a return of capital. our dividend growth is due to the increase in cash flows resulting from the merger transaction and the continued growth of our operations.

see reconciliation of income from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda in the "adjusted ebitda" section.
due to the nature of our contracts, changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect both commodity sales and cost of sales and fuel in our consolidated statements of income and, therefore, the impact is largely offset between the two line items.
2017 vs. 2016 - operating income and adjusted ebitda increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   natural gas and ngl volume growth in the williston basin and stack and scoop areas in our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments;
•   restructured contracts resulting in higher fee revenues from increased average fee rates and a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under our pop with fee contracts in our natural gas gathering and processing segment;
•   higher optimization and marketing earnings due to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials in our natural gas liquids segment; and
•   higher firm demand charge contracted capacity in our natural gas pipelines segment; offset partially by
•   higher labor and employee-related costs associated with benefit plans across all three of our segments, labor costs associated with the growth of operations in our natural gas gathering and processing segment, routine maintenance projects in our natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments and higher ad valorem taxes in our natural gas liquids segment;
•   merger transaction costs in 2017 of $30.0 million; and
•   lower net realized natural gas prices and condensate prices in our natural gas gathering and processing segment.
operating income was also impacted in 2017 by $16.0 million of noncash impairment charges related to nonstrategic long-lived assets in our natural gas gathering and processing segment.
43
net income was further impacted by a one-time noncash charge through income tax expense of $141.3 million, related to revaluation of our deferred tax balances and a valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act and $20.0 million of noncash expenses related to our series e preferred stock contribution to the foundation.
equity in net earnings from investments increased due primarily to higher firm transportation revenues related to roadrunner's phase ii capacity, which was placed in service in october 2016. roadrunner is fully subscribed under long-term firm demand charge contracts.
in 2017, we recorded $4.3 million of noncash impairment charges related to a nonstrategic equity investment in our natural gas gathering and processing segment.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased as a result of the merger transaction. prior to june 30, 2017, we and our subsidiaries owned all of the general partner interest, which included incentive distribution rights, and a portion of the limited partner interest, which together represented a 41.2 percent ownership interest in oneok partners. the earnings of oneok partners that are attributed to its units held by the public prior to the merger transaction are reported as "net income attributable to noncontrolling interest" in our accompanying consolidated statements of income until june 30, 2017.
capital expenditures decreased due primarily to growth projects placed in service in 2016 in our natural gas gathering and processing segment.
2016 vs. 2015 - operating income and adjusted ebitda increased due primarily as a result of the following:
•   higher natural gas and ngl volumes from our completed capital-growth projects in our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments and from new plant connections and increased ethane recovery in our natural gas liquids segment;
•   higher fees resulting from contract restructuring in our natural gas gathering and processing segment; and
•   higher firm demand charge volumes contracted in our natural gas pipelines segment; offset partially by
•   lower net realized ngl and natural gas prices in our natural gas gathering and processing segment; and
•   higher labor costs associated with the growth of our operations in our natural gas gathering and processing segment and higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans in all three of our segments.
operating income was also impacted by higher depreciation expense due to projects completed in 2016 and 2015 and noncash expenses of a share-based deferred compensation plan due primarily to the increase of oneok's share price in 2016.
equity in net earnings from investments increased due primarily to higher volumes delivered to overland pass pipeline from our bakken ngl pipeline and higher firm transportation revenues on northern border pipeline and roadrunner, offset partially by lower equity earnings from our powder river basin equity investments.
interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher interest costs incurred associated with our $500 million debt issuance in august 2015 and lower capitalized interest due to lower spending on capital-growth projects.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects primarily the portion of oneok partners that we did not own, increased in 2016, compared with 2015, due primarily to higher earnings at oneok partners, including noncash impairment charges in 2015.
capital expenditures decreased due to projects placed in service in 2016 and 2015, spending reductions to align with customer needs and lower well connect activities in our natural gas gathering and processing segment due to a reduction in drilling and completion activity.
additional information regarding our financial results and operating information is provided in the following discussion for each of our segments.
natural gas gathering and processing growth projects - our natural gas gathering and processing segment is investing in growth projects in ngl-rich areas, including the bakken shale and three forks formations in the williston basin and the stack and scoop areas, that we expect will enable us to meet the needs of crude oil and natural gas producers in those areas. nearly all of the new natural gas production is from horizontally drilled wells in nonconventional resource areas. these wells tend to produce volumes at higher

initial production rates resulting generally in higher initial decline rates than conventional vertical wells; however, the decline rates flatten out over time. these wells are expected to have long productive lives.
in 2017, we announced plans to expand our canadian valley natural gas processing facility to 400 mmcf/d from 200 mmcf/d and related gathering infrastructure in the stack area. this project is expected to be complete by the end of 2018 at a cost of approximately $160 million, excluding capitalized interest, and is supported by long-term primarily fee-based contracts, minimum volume commitments and acreage dedications.
in february 2018, we announced plans to construct the 200 mmcf/d demicks lake natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the core of the williston basin. this project is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter 2019 at a cost of $400 million, excluding capitalized interest, and is supported by long-term primarily fee-based contracts and acreage dedications.

2017 vs. 2016 - adjusted ebitda increased $71.7 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $66.0 million due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the williston basin and the stack and scoop areas, offset partially by natural production declines and the impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter 2017; and
•   an increase of $44.0 million due primarily to restructured contracts resulting in higher fee revenues from increased average fee rates, offset partially by a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under our pop with fee contracts; offset partially by
•   an increase of $23.9 million in operating costs due primarily to increased labor and employee-related costs associated with our benefit plans and the growth of our operations;
•   a decrease of $11.9 million due primarily to lower realized natural gas and condensate prices; and
•   a decrease of $8.0 million due to contract settlements in 2016.
capital expenditures decreased due to growth projects placed in service in 2016.
see "capital expenditures" in "liquidity and capital resources" for additional detail of our projected capital expenditures.
2016 vs. 2015 - adjusted ebitda increased $128.2 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $144.3 million due primarily to restructured contracts resulting in higher fee revenues from increased average fee rates, offset partially by a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under our pop with fee contracts;
•   an increase of $92.2 million due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the rocky mountain region, offset partially by volume declines in the mid-continent region and the impact of weather in the williston basin in december 2016; and
•   an increase of $8.0 million due to contract settlements; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $91.9 million due primarily to lower net realized ngl and natural gas prices;
•   an increase of $13.2 million in operating costs due primarily to increased labor related to the growth of our operations resulting from completed capital-growth projects and higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans;
•   a decrease of $7.2 million due to lower equity earnings primarily related to our powder river basin equity investments; and
•   a decrease of $4.0 million due primarily to increased ethane recovery to maintain downstream ngl product specifications.
capital expenditures decreased due to projects placed in service, spending reductions to align with customer needs and lower well connect activities due to a reduction in drilling and completion activity.

natural gas gathered, natural gas processed, ngl sales and residue natural gas sales increased in 2016, compared with 2015, due to the completion of capital-growth projects in the williston basin, offset partially by natural gas volume declines in the mid-continent region.
the quantity and composition of ngls and natural gas are expected to continue to change with anticipated production increases across our supply basins, new processing plants placed in service and increased ethane recovery.
commodity price risk - see discussion regarding our commodity price risk under "commodity price risk" in item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
impairment charges - in the third quarter 2017, following a review of nonstrategic assets for potential divestiture, we recorded $16.0 million of noncash impairment charges related to certain nonstrategic gathering and processing assets located in north dakota and $4.3 million of noncash impairment charges related to a nonstrategic equity investment located in oklahoma.
in 2015, due to the continued and greater than expected decline in volumes gathered in the dry natural gas area of the powder river basin, we evaluated our investments in this area. we recorded a $63.5 million noncash impairment charge to long-lived assets for our coal-bed methane natural gas gathering system, which we shut down in 2016. we reviewed our bighorn gas gathering, fort union gas gathering and lost creek gathering company equity investments and recorded noncash impairment charges of $180.6 million in 2015.
in 2015, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $10.2 million related to a previously idled asset, as our expectation for future use of the asset changed.
natural gas liquids growth projects - our growth strategy in our natural gas liquids segment is focused around the crude oil and ngl-rich natural gas drilling activity in shale and other nonconventional resource areas from the rocky mountain region through the mid-continent region into the permian basin. crude oil, natural gas and ngl production from this activity; higher petrochemical industry demand for ngl products; and increased exports have resulted in our making additional capital investments to expand our infrastructure to bring these commodities from supply basins to market.
our natural gas liquids segment invests in ngl-related projects to accommodate the transportation, fractionation and storage of ngl supply from shale and other resource development areas across our asset base and alleviate expected infrastructure constraints between the mid-continent and gulf coast market centers and to meet increasing petrochemical industry and ngl export demand in the gulf coast.

in january 2018, we announced plans to construct the new elk creek pipeline and related infrastructure to transport ngls from the rocky mountain region, which includes the williston, dj and powder river basins, to our existing mid-continent ngl facilities. the project includes construction of an approximately 900-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 and will have the capacity to transport up to 240 mbbl/d of unfractionated ngls to bushton, kansas. the pipeline will have the capability to be expanded to 400 mbbl/d with additional pump facilities. this project is
47
anchored by long-term contracts with terms ranging between 10 to 15 years totaling approximately 100 mbbl/d, which is supported primarily by minimum volume commitments.
in february 2018, we announced plans to construct the new arbuckle ii pipeline and related infrastructure project, with initial capacity to transport 400 mbbl/d of ngls originating across our supply basins to our storage and fractionation facilities in mont belvieu, texas. the approximately 530-mile pipeline is expandable to 1,000 mbbl/d with additional pump facilities. this project is anchored by long-term contracts with terms ranging from 10 to 20 years and is more than 50 percent contracted.
in february 2018, we announced plans to construct the new mb-4 fractionation facility and related infrastructure, which includes additional ngl storage capacity in mont belvieu, texas. our current available fractionation capacity in the gulf coast region is not sufficient for the expected increase in ngl volumes from supply growth and our pipeline projects discussed above. the fractionator will have a capacity of 125 mbbl/d, is anchored by long-term contracts with terms ranging from 10 to 20 years and is fully contracted.
in 2015 and 2016 we completed the following projects:

we continue to evaluate opportunities to increase the capacity of our gathering and fractionation assets or construct new assets to connect supply growth from the williston basin, mid-continent and permian basin with end-use markets. the elk creek pipeline project replaces our previously announced expansion of the bakken ngl pipeline.
in 2017, we connected one third-party natural gas processing plant to our ngl system in the rocky mountain region, two in the permian basin and three in the stack and scoop areas of the mid-continent region.

due to the nature of our contracts, changes in commodity prices and sales volumes affect commodity sales and cost of sales and fuel, and therefore the impact is largely offset between these line items.

2017 vs. 2016 - adjusted ebitda increased $75.3 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $81.5 million in exchange services due primarily to increased supply volumes in the williston basin, the stack and scoop areas and the powder river basin and ethane recovery; offset partially by lower volumes in the granite wash and barnett shale and reduced volumes related to hurricane harvey;
•   an increase of $13.5 million in our optimization and marketing activities due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials; and
•   an increase of $5.4 million in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to overland pass pipeline from our bakken ngl pipeline and higher volumes and increased ethane recovery from plants connected to overland pass pipeline; offset partially by
•   an increase of $32.2 million in operating costs due primarily to routine maintenance projects, higher ad valorem taxes, higher labor and employee-related costs associated with our benefit plans and additional operating costs related to hurricane harvey.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to increased routine growth and maintenance projects.
2016 vs. 2015 - adjusted ebitda increased $107.3 million, primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $90.0 million in exchange services due to increased exchange services volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants primarily in the williston basin, increased mid-continent volumes gathered in the stack and scoop areas and increased volumes resulting from increased ethane recovery primarily from the williston basin to maintain downstream ngl product specifications; offset partially by lower volumes and rates on the west texas lpg system and the impact of weather on our system in december 2016;
•   an increase of $15.8 million in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to overland pass pipeline from our bakken ngl pipeline;
•   an increase of $13.8 million in transportation and storage services due to higher storage and terminaling revenue in the gulf coast and revenues from minimum volume obligations on our distribution pipelines;
•   an increase of $8.4 million related to higher isomerization volumes resulting from wider ngl price differentials between normal butane and iso-butane; and
•   an increase of $4.3 million due to the impact of operational measurement gains in 2016 and operational measurement losses in 2015; offset partially by
•   a decrease of $13.8 million in our optimization and marketing activities, which resulted from a $20.0 million decrease due primarily to narrower product price differentials, offset partially by a $6.2 million increase due primarily to higher optimization volumes; and
•   an increase of $13.1 million in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans.
capital expenditures decreased due primarily to spending reductions for growth capital to align with customer needs.
in 2015, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $10.0 million related to a previously idled asset, as our expectation for future use of the asset changed.

2017 vs. 2016 - ngls transported on gathering lines and ngls fractionated increased due to higher volumes primarily from the stack and scoop areas and williston basin resulting from recent plant connections, increased supply and increased ethane recovery, which was offset partially by decreased volumes from the barnett shale and granite wash. ngls transported on gathering lines also increased due to higher volumes from the permian basin.
while overall ngl supply volumes and ethane recovery increased, a portion of the fees associated with those volumes gathered and fractionated was previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations.

ngls transported on distribution lines increased due primarily to higher transported volumes for optimization activities.
2016 vs. 2015 - ngls transported on gathering lines remained relatively unchanged due to increased volumes from new plant connections in the williston basin, increased ethane recovery and increased mid-continent volumes gathered in the stack and scoop areas, offset by decreased volumes on the west texas lpg system, decreased mid-continent volumes gathered from the barnett shale, lower short-term contracted volumes and the impact of weather on gathered volumes across our system in december 2016.

while the volume of ethane recovered increased, a portion of the fees associated with those volumes gathered and fractionated was previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations.
ngls transported on distribution lines increased due primarily to higher gathered and fractionated volumes as discussed above and due to increased volumes transported for our optimization business.
natural gas pipelines growth projects - the development of shale and other resource areas has continued to increase available natural gas supply, and we expect producers to require incremental transportation services in the future as additional supply is developed. the abundance of natural gas supply and regulations on emissions from coal-fired electric-generation plants may also increase the demand for our services from electric-generation companies if they convert to a natural gas fuel source.

2017 vs. 2016 - adjusted ebitda increased $26.7 million primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $26.9 million from higher transportation services due primarily to increased firm demand charge contracted capacity; and
•   an increase of $12.9 million in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher firm transportation revenues on roadrunner; offset partially by
•   an increase of $10.6 million in operating costs due primarily to routine maintenance projects and higher labor and employee-related costs associated with our benefit plans; and
•   a decrease of $6.3 million due primarily to gains on sales of excess natural gas in storage in 2016.
2016 vs. 2015 - adjusted ebitda increased $38.1 million primarily as a result of the following:
•   an increase of $28.5 million from higher transportation services due primarily to increased firm demand charge contracted capacity;
•   an increase of $9.3 million from higher net retained fuel due to higher throughput and the associated natural gas volumes retained and higher equity gas sales related to transportation and storage services;
•   an increase of $6.6 million due to higher natural gas storage services as a result of increased storage rates and increased sales of excess natural gas in storage; and
•   an increase of $5.7 million in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher firm transportation revenues on northern border pipeline and roadrunner; offset partially by
•   an increase of $9.9 million in operating costs due primarily to increased employee-related costs associated with incentive and medical benefit plans and higher ad valorem taxes.
capital expenditures increased due primarily to our westex pipeline expansion and other expansion projects.

our natural gas pipelines primarily serve end users, such as natural gas distribution and electric-generation companies, that require natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of location price differentials. overall, our contracted transportation capacity and fee-based earnings in this segment increased in connection with the october 2016 completion of our westex pipeline expansion.

northern border pipeline, in which we have a 50 percent ownership interest, has contracted substantially all of its long-haul transportation capacity through the fourth quarter 2020. we made a contribution of $83 million to norther border pipeline in the third quarter 2017. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2016, we made no contributions to norther border pipeline.
under the terms of settlement with shippers in 2012, northern border pipeline was required to file a rate case by january 1, 2018. in december 2017, northern border pipeline entered into a settlement with shippers that was approved by the ferc in february 2018. the settlement provides for tiered rate reductions beginning january 1, 2018, that will reduce rates 12.5 percent by january 2020 compared with previous rates and requires new rates to be established by january 2024. we do not expect the resulting decrease in equity earnings and cash distributions from northern border pipeline to be material to us.
roadrunner, in which we have a 50 percent ownership interest, has contracted all of its capacity through 2041. we contributed $4 million, $65 million and $30 million to roadrunner during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap measure of our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, allowance for equity funds used during construction, noncash compensation and other noncash items. prior periods have been adjusted to conform to current presentation. we believe this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in our industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare financial performance among companies in our industry. adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income, earnings per unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap. additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.

contingencies see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a discussion of developments concerning the gas index pricing litigation.
52
other legal proceedings - we are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. while the results of these litigation matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources general - historically, our primary source of cash inflows were distributions to us from our general partner and limited partner interests in oneok partners. beginning in the third quarter 2017, as a result of the completion of the merger transaction, our cash flow sources and requirements significantly changed. we now rely primarily on operating cash flows, commercial paper, bank credit facilities, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resources requirements. in addition, we expect increased cash outflows related to i) capital expenditures, which were previously funded by oneok partners and ii) dividends paid to shareholders, due to the increase in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the close of the merger transaction, our recent equity issuances and higher anticipated dividends per share, subject to board of directors' approval. we expect to pay no significant cash income taxes through 2021.
we expect our sources of cash inflow to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures and quarterly cash dividends, including expected future dividend increases. to the extent operating cash flows are not sufficient to fund our dividends, we may utilize short- and long-term debt and issuances of equity, as necessary or appropriate. we may access the capital markets to issue debt or equity securities as we consider prudent to provide liquidity to refinance existing debt, improve credit metrics or to fund capital expenditures. however, with $1.6 billion of equity issued in 2017 and january 2018, we have satisfied our expected equity financing needs through 2018 and well into 2019. we expect to fund growth projects with cash from operations, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
we manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt and interest-rate swaps. for additional information on our interest rate swaps, see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
cash management - we use a centralized cash management program that concentrates the cash assets of our operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purposes of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group. our operating subsidiaries participate in this program to the extent they are permitted pursuant to ferc regulations or their operating agreements. under the cash management program, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash requirements, we provide cash to the subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to us.
short-term liquidity - our principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, distributions received from our equity-method investments, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $2.5 billion credit agreement.
in april 2017, we entered into the $2.5 billion credit agreement with a syndicate of banks to replace the oneok credit agreement and the oneok partners credit agreement. the $2.5 billion credit agreement became effective june 30, 2017, upon the closing of the merger transaction (as described in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report) and the terminations of the oneok credit agreement and the oneok partners credit agreement. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants of the $2.5 billion credit agreement.
in july 2017, the commercial paper outstanding under the oneok partners commercial paper program was repaid as it matured with a combination of proceeds from new issuances from oneok's recently established $2.5 billion commercial paper program, cash on hand and proceeds from our july 2017 $1.2 billion senior notes issuance. the $2.4 billion oneok partners commercial paper program was terminated in july 2017.
at december 31, 2017, we had $37.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion of borrowing capacity under the $2.5 billion credit agreement. following the january 2018 equity offering, we had $2.5 billion of borrowing capacity.
we had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $0.9 billion and $1.4 billion as of december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016, respectively. although working capital is influenced by several factors, including, among other things: (i) the timing of (a) scheduled debt payments, (b) the collection and payment of accounts
53
receivable and payable, and (c) equity and debt issuances, and (ii) the volume and cost of inventory and commodity imbalances, our working capital deficit at december 31, 2017, and at december 31, 2016, was driven primarily by current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings. we may have working capital deficits in future periods as we continue to finance our capital-growth projects and repay long-term debt, often initially with short-term borrowings. our decision to utilize short-term borrowings rather than long-term debt, due to more favorable interest rates, contributes to our working capital deficit. we do not expect this working capital deficit to have an adverse impact to our cash flows or operations.
for additional information on our $2.5 billion credit agreement and commercial paper program, see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
long-term financing - in addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, we expect to fund our longer-term financing requirements by issuing long-term notes. other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuing common stock, loans from financial institutions, issuance of convertible debt securities or preferred equity securities, asset securitization and the sale and lease-back of facilities.
debt issuances and upcoming maturities - in july 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $500 million, 4.0 percent senior notes due 2027, and $700 million, 4.95 percent senior notes due 2047. the net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were $1.2 billion. the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of existing indebtedness and capital expenditures.
we expect to repay oneok partners' $425 million, 3.2 percent senior notes due in september 2018, with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings.
repayments - we repaid $500 million in both january 2018 and july 2017 on the term loan agreement due 2019 with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. as of january 2018, all amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement have been repaid.
in 2017, we repaid oneok partners' $400 million, 2.0 percent senior notes due in october 2017 with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings and redeemed our 6.5 percent senior notes due 2028 at a redemption price of $87.0 million with cash on hand.
for additional information on our long-term debt, see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
equity issuances - in january 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 21.9 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $54.50 per share, generating net proceeds of $1.2 billion. we used the net proceeds from this offering to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, which included repaying a portion of our outstanding indebtedness.
in july 2017, we established an "at-the-market" equity program for the offer and sale from time to time of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion. the program allows us to offer and sell our common stock at prices we deem appropriate through a sales agent. sales of our common stock may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the nyse, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between us and the sales agent. we are under no obligation to offer and sell common stock under the program.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold 8.4 million shares of common stock through our "at-the-market" equity program that resulted in net proceeds of $448.3 million. the net proceeds from these issuances were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures. we have satisfied our expected equity financing needs through 2018 and well into 2019.
in april 2017, through a wholly owned subsidiary, we contributed 20,000 shares of series e preferred stock, having an aggregate value of $20.0 million, to the foundation for use in future charitable and nonprofit causes. the contribution was recorded as a $20.0 million noncash expense in 2017.

capital expenditures - the following table sets forth our growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding afudc and capitalized interest, for the periods indicated:

natural gas pipelines                           95.6                96.3                  58.2

total capital expenditures                    $512.4              $624.6              $1,188.3
capital expenditures decreased in 2017 compared with 2016, due primarily to the completion of several large projects. capital expenditures decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to the completion of several large projects and reduced capital spending to align with the needs of our crude oil and natural gas producers.
we classify expenditures that are expected to generate additional revenue, return on investment or significant operating efficiencies as capital-growth expenditures. maintenance capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our existing assets and operations and do not generate additional revenues. maintenance capital expenditures are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives. our capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt and the issuance of equity.
the following table summarizes our 2018 projected growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding afudc and capitalized interest:
2018 projected capital expenditures
(millions of dollars)
growth                                                       $1,950-$2,300
maintenance                                                      $140-$180
total projected capital expenditures                         $2,090-$2,480
our projected capital expenditures for 2018 has increased compared with 2017, due primarily to our announced capital-growth projects.
credit ratings - our long-term debt credit ratings as of february 22, 2018, are shown in the table below:
rating agency   rating   outlook moody's         baa3     stable s&amp;p         bbb      stable following the close of the merger transaction, s&p and moody's upgraded our credit ratings, removed our credit rating from review and issued stable outlooks. our commercial paper program is rated prime-3 by moody's and a-2 by s&p.
our credit ratings, which are investment grade, may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material event affecting our business and industry. the most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt-to-ebitda ratio, interest coverage, business risk profile and liquidity. if our credit ratings were downgraded, our cost to borrow funds under the $2.5 billion credit agreement would increase and a potential loss of access to the commercial paper market could occur. in the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we would continue to have access to our $2.5 billion credit agreement, which expires in 2022. an adverse credit rating change alone is not a default under our $2.5 billion credit agreement. we do not expect a downgrade in our credit rating to have a material impact on our results of operations.
in the normal course of business, our counterparties provide us with secured and unsecured credit. in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings or a significant change in our counterparties' evaluation of our creditworthiness, we could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments.
55
dividends - holders of our common stock share equally in any dividend declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred stock. in 2017, we paid dividends of $2.72 per share, an increase of 11 percent compared with the prior year. in february 2018, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share ($3.08 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 25 percent compared with the same period in the prior year. our dividend growth is due to the increase in cash flows resulting from the merger transaction and the continued growth of our operations.
our series e preferred stock pays quarterly dividends on each share of series e preferred stock, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, at a rate of 5.5 percent per year. in 2017, we paid dividends of $0.6 million for the series e preferred stock. in february 2018, we paid dividends totaling $0.3 million for the series e preferred stock.
in 2018, we expect our cash flows from operations to continue to sufficiently fund our cash dividends. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, cash dividends and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests were sufficiently funded by cash flows from operations.
cash distributions - prior to the consummation of the merger transaction, we received distributions from oneok partners on our common and class b units and our 2 percent general partner interest, which included our incentive distribution rights. distributions paid to oneok partners unitholders of record at the close of business on january 30, 2017, and may 1, 2017, were $0.79 per unit. our incentive distribution rights effectively terminated at the close of the merger transaction.
cash flow analysis we use the indirect method to prepare our consolidated statements of cash flows. under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that affect net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period and for operating cash items that do not impact net income. these reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, deferred income taxes, net undistributed earnings from equity-method investments, share-based compensation expense, pension and postretirement benefit expense net of contributions, noncash expense related to our series e preferred stock contribution to the foundation, other amounts and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities.
the following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:

cash and cash equivalents at end of period                                          $37.2                  $248.9                   $97.6
operating cash flows - operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows.
2017 vs. 2016 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, increased to $1.5 billion for 2017, compared with $1.4 billion for 2016. this increase is due primarily to higher revenues resulting from volume growth in the williston basin and stack and scoop areas in our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, higher fees resulting from contract restructuring in our natural gas gathering and processing segment, higher transportation services due to increased firm demand charge contracted capacity in our natural gas pipelines segment and higher optimization and marketing earnings due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials in our natural gas liquids segment, as discussed in "financial results and operating information."
56
the changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $192.6 million for 2017, compared with a decrease of $40.7 million for 2016. this change is due primarily to the change in natural gas and ngls in storage, which varies from period to period and varies with changes in commodity prices, the change in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accruals and deferrals resulting from the timing of receipt of cash from customers and payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties and the change in risk-management assets and liabilities.
2016 vs. 2015 - cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $1.4 billion for 2016, compared with $1.2 billion for 2015. the increase was due primarily to higher natural gas and ngl volumes from our completed capital-growth projects in our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, new plant connections and increased ethane recovery in our natural gas liquids segment and higher fees resulting from contract restructuring in our natural gas gathering and processing segment, offset partially by lower realized commodity prices, as discussed in "financial results and operating information." distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates also increased, due primarily to overland pass pipeline.
the changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $40.7 million for 2016, compared with a decrease of $133.1 million for 2015. this change is due primarily to the change in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accruals and deferrals resulting from the timing of receipt of cash from customers and payments to vendors and suppliers, which vary from period to period and vary with changes in commodity prices, and the change in commodity imbalances, offset partially by the change in risk-management assets and liabilities related to interest-rate swaps.
investing cash flows
2017 vs. 2016 - cash used in investing activities decreased $47.8 million due primarily to projects placed in service in 2016, offset partially by lower distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates in excess of cumulative earnings, lower proceeds from sale of assets and higher contributions to our unconsolidated affiliates.
2016 vs. 2015 - cash used in investing activities decreased $575.3 million due primarily to lower capital spending as a result of spending reductions to align with customer needs and projects placed in service, higher proceeds received from sale of assets and higher distributions received from northern border pipeline and overland pass pipeline, offset partially by higher contributions made to roadrunner.
financing cash flows
2017 vs. 2016 - cash used in financing activities increased $373.0 million due primarily to repayment of short-term borrowings and increased dividends, offset partially by the issuance of common stock through our "at-the-market" equity program and decreased distributions to noncontrolling interests resulting from the merger transaction.
2016 vs. 2015 - cash used in financing activities was $586.5 million in 2016, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $92.7 million in 2015, a decrease of $679.2 million, due primarily to repayment of $1.1 billion of senior notes, $100 million increase in distributions paid due to a higher number of units outstanding and no equity issuances in 2016. these differences were offset partially by an increase in proceeds from short-term borrowings and drawing on our term loan agreement.
impact of new accounting standards information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.
57
the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those estimates and policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. we have discussed the development and selection of our estimates and critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors.
derivatives and risk-management activities - we utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations and to achieve more predictable cash flows. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship. when possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes.
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss from a change in fair value of the derivative instrument is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction affects earnings, at which time the fair value of the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings.
we assess the effectiveness of hedging relationships quarterly by performing an effectiveness test on our hedging relationships to determine whether they are highly effective on a retrospective and prospective basis. we do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges for which ineffectiveness is not material. however, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for cash flow hedge accounting or if we fail to appropriately designate it as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings. additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings. for more information on commodity price sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
see notes c and d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of fair value measurements and derivatives and risk-management activities.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets - we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually on july 1, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time. our qualitative goodwill impairment analysis performed as of july 1, 2017, did not result in an impairment charge nor did our analysis reflect any reporting units at risk, and subsequent to that date, no event has occurred indicating that the implied fair value of each of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of its net assets.
as part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. if further testing is necessary or a quantitative test is elected, we perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. in the first step, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. if the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. in the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, using assumptions consistent with a market participant's perspective. under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate discount rates. under the market approach, we apply ebitda multiples to forecasted ebitda. the multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. the forecasted cash flows are based on average forecasted cash flows for a reporting unit over a period of years.

natural gas liquids                        371,217                    268,544
natural gas pipelines                      156,479                    134,700
total goodwill                            $681,100                   $525,535
as a result of the merger transaction, we are entitled to receive all available oneok partners cash. our incentive distribution rights effectively terminated at the close of the merger transaction. as a result, the $155.6 million carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with our incentive distribution rights was reclassified to goodwill at the close of the merger transaction and allocated among our business segments.
we assess our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.
for the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. therefore, we periodically evaluate the amount at which we carry our equity-method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value.
impairment charges - we recorded $20.2 million of noncash impairment charges in 2017 related to our nonstrategic long-lived assets and equity investments in north dakota and oklahoma, and $264.3 million of noncash impairment charges in 2015 primarily related to our long-lived assets and equity investments in the dry natural gas area of the powder river basin.
our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges.
see notes a, e, f and n of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
retirement and postretirement employee benefits - we have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain employees and former employees. our defined benefit pension plan covers certain employees and former employees hired before january 1, 2005, and our supplemental executive retirement plan for the benefit of certain officers closed to new participants in january 2014. we sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees hired prior to 2017 who retire with at least five years of service. the expense and liability related to these plans is calculated using statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. these factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality and employment length. in determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize.
during 2017, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $18.4 million related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plans. we estimate that in 2018, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $18.1 million related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plans. sensitivities to changes with respect to the weighted-average assumptions used to determine our estimated 2018 net periodic benefit obligations are not material.
see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information.
contingencies - our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. we accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. we expense legal fees as incurred and base our legal liability estimates on currently available facts and our assessments of the ultimate outcome or resolution.
59
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than the completion of a remediation feasibility study. recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effect on earnings or cash flows during 2017, 2016 or 2015. actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on our results of operations.
see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional discussion of contingencies.

md&a overview management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ended december 31, 2017. as a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. this md&a is divided into the following sections:
•   the company's business
•   performance highlights
•   critical accounting estimates
•   results of operations, consolidated and by segment
•   analysis of financial condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments
•   capital resources and liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash the company's business aflac incorporated (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the united states and japan. the company's insurance business is marketed and administered through american family life assurance company of columbus (aflac), which operates in the united states (aflac u.s.) and as a branch in japan (aflac japan). american family life assurance company of new york (aflac new york) is a wholly owned subsidiary of aflac. most of aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. additionally, aflac u.s. markets and administers group products through continental american insurance company (caic), branded as aflac group insurance. the company's insurance operations in the united states and its branch in japan service the two markets for its insurance business.
for more information on the company's business, see business, part i, item 1 of this report.
performance highlights yen-denominated income statement accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using a weighted-average japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate, while yen-denominated balance sheet accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using a spot japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate. the spot yen/dollar exchange rate at december 31, 2017 was 113.00, or 3.1% stronger than the spot yen/dollar exchange rate of 116.49 at december 31, 2016. the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 112.16, or 3.1% weaker than the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate of 108.70 for the same period in 2016.
total revenues decreased 4.0% to $21.7 billion in 2017, compared with $22.6 billion in 2016. net earnings in 2017 were $4.6 billion, or $11.54 per diluted share, compared with $2.7 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, in 2016, reflecting the estimated $1.9 billion benefit as a result of the u.s. tax act.
results for 2017 included pretax net realized investment losses of $151 million ($98 million after-tax), compared with net realized investment losses of $14 million ($9 million after-tax) in 2016. net investment losses in 2017 consisted of $28 million of net gains ($18 million after-tax) from the sale or redemption of securities; $37 million ($24 million after-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses; and $142 million of net losses ($92 million after-tax) from derivatives and foreign currency gains (losses).
in october 2017, the parent company issued 60.0 billion yen of subordinated debentures through a u.s. public debt offering. in november 2017, the parent company used a portion of net proceeds to redeem $500 million of the parent company's 5.50% subordinated debentures due 2052. the pretax expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $13 million.
in january 2017, the parent company issued 60.0 billion yen of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. in february 2017, the parent company extinguished $650 million of 2.65% senior notes upon their maturity.
in 2017, the parent company and aflac renewed a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million and executed two 364-day intercompany uncommitted and revolving lines of credit, one of which provides for borrowings by aflac in the amount of $250 million, and the other provides for borrowings by the parent company in the amount of 37.5 billion yen.

for further information regarding these transactions, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the capital resources and liquidity section of this md&a.
the company repurchased 17.8 million shares of its common stock in the open market for $1.35 billion under the company's share repurchase program in 2017, compared with the repurchase of 21.6 million shares for $1.4 billion in 2016.
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are established primarily by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). in this md&a, references to u.s. gaap issued by the fasb are derived from the fasb accounting standards codificationtm (asc). the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. the estimates that the company deems to be most critical to an understanding of aflac's results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 95% of the company's assets and 81% of its liabilities are reported as of december 31, 2017, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
investments and derivatives aflac's investments, primarily consisting of debt, perpetual and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. for publicly issued securities, the company determines the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. for the majority of privately issued securities within the company's investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models that the company utilizes to determine fair values. for the remaining privately issued securities, the company uses non-binding price quotes from outside brokers.
the company estimates the fair values of its securities on a monthly basis. the company monitors the estimated fair values obtained from its pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. the company also periodically discusses with its pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. if a fair value appears unreasonable, the company will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally, the company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. based on management's analysis, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. the company has performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value.
the company also routinely reviews its investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. the identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment. the company must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while the company owns it. factors that may influence this include the company's assessment of the issuer's ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal, the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads, and other factors. this process requires consideration of risks, which can be controlled to a certain extent, such as credit risk, and risks which cannot be controlled, such as interest rate risk. management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairment losses in the company's net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the loss, as such evaluations are revised.
the company's derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities (vies) that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and its subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions) used in hedging interest rate risk on u.s. dollar-denominated securities in aflac japan's portfolio; and foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign
39
currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. for derivatives associated with vies where it is the primary beneficiary, the company receives valuations from a third party pricing vendor.
see notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities insurance premiums for most of the company's health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, dental, vision, term life, whole life, long-term care and disability, are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. when revenues are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during the period the policies are expected to remain in force. this association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.
premiums from the company's products with limited-pay features, including term life, whole life, ways, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided. premiums for these products are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded in earnings, such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. a liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.
deferred policy acquisition costs the calculation of dac and the liability for future policy benefits requires the use of estimates based on sound actuarial valuation techniques. for new policy issues, the company reviews its actuarial assumptions and deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual acquisition costs. for policies in force, the company evaluates dac by major product groupings to determine that they are recoverable from future revenues, and any amounts determined not to be recoverable are charged against net earnings. see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detail of the dac activity for the past two years.

the company's policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under u.s. gaap and actuarial standards of practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 83% and 4% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2017, respectively.
future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. the company calculates future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. these assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. the assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. as required by u.s. gaap, the company also includes a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to the company. the company computes unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. the company updates the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporates its historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding the company's outstanding liability.
the company's insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. furthermore, the company's business is widely dispersed in both the united states and japan. this geographic dispersion and the nature of the company's benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. claims incurred under aflac's policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. the unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. the company's claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of its policyholders.
as a part of its established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, the company performs detailed annual actuarial reviews of its policyholder liabilities (gross premium valuation, gpv, analysis) and reflects the results of those reviews in its results of operations and financial condition as required by u.s. gaap. for aflac japan, the company's annual reviews in 2016 and 2015 indicated that it needed to strengthen the liability associated with a block of care policies, primarily due to low investment yields. the company strengthened its future policy benefits liability by $52 and $18 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of these reviews. results of the company's annual review in 2017 concluded that no further strengthening was required at this time for these liabilities. for aflac u.s., the company's annual reviews in 2017, 2016 and 2015 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in the united states. in the u.s. and japan, investment assumptions were reviewed in 2017 and the company adopted expected forward rates in its gpv yield projections. in addition, in japan, assets were allocated to blocks of business to align with yield and duration requirements of the businesses.
the table below reflects the growth of the future policy benefits liability for the years ended december 31.

the growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for aflac japan and in dollars for aflac u.s. has been due to the aging of the company's in-force block of business and the addition of new business.

in computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, the company considers many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. the company monitors these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. in calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, the company does not calculate a range of estimates. the following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of december 31, 2017, to changes in severity and frequency of claims.

other policy liabilities, which accounted for 13% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2017, consisted primarily of annuity and unearned premium reserves, and discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain aflac japan insurance products. these advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period. advanced premiums represented 34% and 38% of the december 31, 2017 and 2016 other policy liabilities balances, respectively. see the aflac japan segment subsection of this md&a for further information.
income taxes income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing the company's income tax returns. deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the company expects the temporary differences to reverse. the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with u.s. gaap is a two-step process. under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. the determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions.
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the company's management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event the company determines it is not more likely than not that it will be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the company's tax planning strategies and in particular the company's ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. the company's judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
interest rates and credit spreads in both the united states and japan are not the only factors that impact the company's unrealized gain/loss position and the evaluation of a need for a valuation allowance on the company's deferred tax asset, but they do have a direct and significant effect on both. based on its methodology described above for evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the company has determined that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, therefore the company has not recorded a valuation allowance as of december 31, 2017.

the tax act was signed into law on december 22, 2017. among other things, effective january 1, 2018 the tax act reduced the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated or reduced certain deductions and credits, and limited the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.
the tax act also transitions international corporate taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system, which in light of the current tax treatment of aflac japan as a branch has the effect of subjecting the earnings of aflac japan to japan taxation and subjecting the company's other earnings, including the consolidated earnings of the parent company, to u.s. taxation.
these changes are effective on january 1, 2018. because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment, during the period ended december 31, 2017, the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded, as its current reasonable estimate, a net deferred tax liability reduction of $1.9 billion as of that date. while the company believes that this estimate is reasonable, it is relying upon guidance provided by sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118) that provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date of december 22, 2017, in order to complete the accounting for the effects of the tax act. this estimate is subject to new and changing regulations, interpretations and tax guidance in the future, as well as further refinement of the company's calculations and changes in the interpretations and assumptions that the company has made. as such, the estimate may change over time, possibly materially, and the company may reduce or increase the estimated reduction of net deferred tax liability.
for additional information on income tax and the effects of the tax act during the period ended december 31, 2017, see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in this report. for information on the conversion of aflac japan from a branch to a subsidiary, see general business under item 1, business, in this report.
new accounting pronouncements during the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. for information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on the company's financial position or results of operations, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations the following discussion includes references to the company's performance measures, operating earnings, operating earnings per diluted share, and amortized hedge costs, which are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with its insurance operations. the company's management uses operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of its insurance operations on a consolidated basis, and the company believes that a presentation of these measures is vitally important to an understanding of its underlying profitability drivers and trends of its insurance business. the company believes that amortized hedge costs, which are a component of operating earnings, measure the periodic currency risk management costs associated with hedging a portion of aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investments and are an important component of net investment income.
aflac defines operating earnings (a non-u.s. gaap financial measure) as the profits derived from operations. operating earnings includes interest cash flows associated with notes payable and amortized hedge costs related to foreign currency denominated investments, but excludes certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management's control, such as realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, change in loan loss reserves and certain derivative and foreign currency activities; nonrecurring items; and other non-operating income (loss) from net earnings. nonrecurring and other non-operating items consist of infrequent events and activity not associated with the normal course of the company's insurance operations and do not reflect aflac's underlying business performance. the company defines operating earnings per share (basic or diluted) to be operating earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. starting in the first quarter of 2018, the term "operating earnings" will be changed to "adjusted earnings" on both a pretax and after-tax basis. this change will only pertain to the label of the measure and will not alter its definition or calculation.
because a significant portion of the company's business is conducted in japan and foreign exchange rates are outside of management's control, the company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u.s. dollars. operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average yen/dollar exchange rate for the comparable prior year period, which

eliminates dollar based fluctuations driven solely from currency rate changes.
the following table is a reconciliation of items impacting operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, respectively, for the years ended december 31.

(3) excludes a gain of $77 in 2017 and $85 in both 2016 and 2015, related to the interest rate component of the change in fair value of foreign currency swaps on notes payable which is classified as an operating gain when analyzing segment operations
(4) foreign currency gains (losses) for all periods have been reclassified from other income (loss) to realized investment gains (losses) - certain derivative and foreign currency gains (losses) for consistency with current period presentation.
(5) calculated using a 35% tax rate
(6) this estimated impact of tax reform may be adjusted for future periods, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the company's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made, tax guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of tax reform.
(7) prior period foreign currency impact reflected as "n/a" to isolate change for current period only.
(8) amounts excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average yen/dollar exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates dollar-based fluctuations driven solely from currency rate changes.
realized investment gains and losses the company's investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed-maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the company's growth and profitability. this investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching (alm) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the company's liability structure. the company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. however, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the company's insurance products.
securities transactions and impairments securities transactions include gains and losses from sales and redemptions of investments where the amount received is different from the amortized cost of the investment. impairments include other-than-temporary-impairment losses on investment securities as well as changes in loan loss reserves for loan receivables.
44
certain derivative and foreign currency gains (losses)
the company's derivative activities include foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaptions and futures on certain fixed-maturity securities; foreign currency forwards and options that economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen; foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and subordinated debentures; and foreign currency swaps and credit defaults swaps held in consolidated variable interest entities (vies). gains and losses are recognized as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. the company also includes the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate as a non-operating item. certain derivative and foreign currency gains (losses) exclude amortized hedge costs (see hedge cost section below) and the interest rate component of the change in fair value of foreign currency swaps on notes payable that are both classified as operating items.
hedge costs effective january 1, 2017, operating earnings includes the impact of amortized hedge costs. amortized hedge costs represent costs incurred in using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of a portion of u.s. dollar-denominated assets in the company's japan segment investment portfolio. these amortized hedge costs are derived from the difference between the foreign currency spot rate at time of trade inception and the contractual foreign currency forward rate, recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the hedge. there is no comparable u.s. gaap financial measure for amortized hedge costs. prior year operating earnings have been revised to conform to this change. beginning in 2016, the company changed its non-u.s. gaap reporting for these hedge costs by amortizing them evenly over the life of the foreign currency forward contracts. in 2016, the company began increasing the duration of the foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge its u.s. dollar-denominated assets in aflac japan's investment portfolio to cover periods extending beyond one year. therefore, recognizing these costs over the extended hedging periods provides a better measure of the company's costs, and better reflects the economics of how hedge costs emerge over the life of the hedge.
hedge costs can fluctuate based upon many factors, including the derivative notional amount, the length of time of the derivative contract, changes in both u.s. and japan interest rates, and supply and demand for u.s. dollar funding. hedge costs have increased in recent periods due to changes in the previously mentioned factors. in late 2017, the company took steps to mitigate rising hedge costs by increasing the amount of unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated investments held in aflac japan and to reduce hedge cost volatility by extending hedge duration. for additional information regarding currency hedging, refer to the hedging activities section below.
for additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
other and non-recurring items the united states insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. the system can result in periodic charges to the company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. these charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance, but result from external situations not controlled by the company.
based on the underlying nature of these assessments, effective january 1, 2017, the company adopted a policy of excluding any charges associated with u.s. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from operating earnings.
for the penn treaty liquidation that was recognized by judicial authority in march 2017, the company estimated and recognized a discounted liability for assessments of $62 million (undiscounted $94 million), offset by discounted premium tax credits of $48 million (undiscounted $74 million), for a net $14 million impact to net income in the quarter ended march 31, 2017. other guaranty fund assessments for the year ended december 31, 2017 were immaterial. for additional information regarding guaranty fund assessments, see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
effective january 1, 2017, nonrecurring items also include conversion costs related to legally converting the company's japan branch to a subsidiary; these costs primarily consist of expenditures for legal, accounting, consulting, integration of systems and processes and other similar services. these japan branch conversion costs amounted to $42 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
45
the company includes the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate as an other non-operating item. during 2016, the company recognized a foreign currency gain of $109 million due to a temporary sizable u.s. dollar cash balance and cash settlements of u.s. dollar-denominated investment transactions within the japan segment.
the company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. additionally, these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt, and the company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations. in november 2017, the parent company extinguished $500 million of its 5.50% subordinated debentures. the pretax non-operating expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $13 million. in 2016, the parent company completed a tender offer in which it extinguished $176 million principal of its 6.90% senior notes due 2039 and $193 million principal of its 6.45% senior notes due 2040. the pretax non-operating loss due to the early redemption of these notes was $137 million. during 2015, the make-whole premium paid to the investors of the company's 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes for the early redemption of those notes was recorded as a $230 million pretax non-operating loss.
tax reform adjustment among other changes, the tax act reduced the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment, the company recognized a non-recurring estimated $1.9 billion benefit in the three-month period and full year ended december 31, 2017. while the company believes that this estimate is reasonable, it is relying upon guidance provided by sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 that provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date of december 22, 2017 in order for the company to complete the accounting for the effects of the tax act. for further information, see critical accounting estimates - income taxes above in this md&a, and note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report.
foreign currency translation aflac japan's premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. aflac japan purchases yen-denominated assets and u.s. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. these and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. the company translates aflac japan's yen-denominated income statement into dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the company translates its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.
due to the size of aflac japan, whose functional currency is the japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the company's reported results. in periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. management evaluates the company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts on book value and the currency-neutral operating performance over time.
income taxes the company's combined u.s. and japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was (14.6)% in 2017, 34.6% in 2016 and 34.4% in 2015. the reduction in the tax rate for 2017 was primarily due to a $1.9 billion benefit as a result of the tax act. the impact of the tax act, including the company's combined u.s. and japanese effective income tax rate, may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, further refinement of the company's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made, tax guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the tax act. the company also benefited from a $24 million favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions in 2017 related to tax years that closed, in addition to benefits associated with filing amended tax returns and the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock compensation. total income taxes were $(586) million in 2017, compared with $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1.3 billion in 2015. japanese income taxes on aflac japan's results account for most of the company's consolidated income tax expense. for further information, see critical accounting estimates - income taxes above in this md&a, and note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
46
2018 outlook the company's objective in 2018 is to maintain its strong capital position while producing stable earnings and strong cash flows. the company believes that its market-leading position, powerful brand recognition and diverse distribution in japan and the united states will provide support toward this objective.
the u.s. tax reforms enacted in december 2017 provided aflac with an opportunity to accelerate and increase its investments in initiatives that reflect the company's values and objectives. the company expects to increase overall investment in the u.s. by approximately $250 million over the next three to five years. these strategic investments target continued growth in the company's u.s. operations, investments in technology and digital businesses, commitments to the company's philanthropic efforts, and employee training programs and expanded employee benefits, including both an enhanced 401(k) matching program and additional company-paid aflac policies.
the company has projected an effective tax rate of 26.5% for 2018, derived from japan's corporate tax rate of 28%, the u.s. rate of 21%, and assuming a stable mix of earnings.
while the company has faced a challenging interest rate environment, particularly in japan, it will continue to monitor these and other economic conditions as the company executes on its plans for sales, investments and capital management. the company believes that its efforts will support its prudent strategies for capital deployment, as well as its ongoing commitment to customer service, product innovation and distribution enhancement.
for important disclosures applicable to statements made in this 2018 outlook, please see the risk factors section and the statement on "forward-looking information" at the beginning of the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
insurance operations aflac's insurance business consists of two segments: aflac japan and aflac u.s. aflac japan, which operates as a branch of aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. operating business segments that are not individually reportable and business activities, including reinsurance retrocession activities, not included in aflac japan or aflac u.s. are included in the "other business segments" category.
on december 2, 2016, the company publicly announced that it will pursue the conversion of aflac japan from a branch structure to a subsidiary structure, with the subsidiary incorporated as a "kabushiki kaisha." while the branch structure remains an acceptable legal form, the subsidiary structure has emerged as the more prevalent structure for both domestic and foreign companies operating in japan. in addition, emerging global regulatory standards generally favor the subsidiary structure for foreign insurance and financial service companies. the adoption of this new organizational framework is expected to be tax-neutral and not to have a material impact on the daily operations of either aflac japan or aflac u.s. as a result of this conversion. in addition, the company expects to obtain enhanced flexibility in capital management and business development as a result of the conversion. the company anticipates completion of the conversion as early as april 1, 2018. as an interim step, effective january 1, 2018, investments of aflac u.s. as well as certain sub-advised assets of aflac japan, are managed by the company's u.s. asset management subsidiary, aflac asset management llc (aam), and investments of aflac japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between aflac japan and the company's asset management subsidiary in japan, aflac asset management ltd. (aamj). aamj is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the japan financial instruments and exchange act and is subject to rules of the japan investment advisors association, a self-regulatory organization with mandatory membership for japan investment managers. aam and aamj will be reported in the "other business segments" category; however, the assets that they manage will be reported in the respective aflac japan and aflac u.s. business segments.
u.s. gaap financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. furthermore, the company is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.
the company evaluates its sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. new annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, generally represent the premiums that the company would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. for aflac japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting
47
period. for aflac u.s., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.
aflac japan segment aflac japan pretax operating earnings changes in aflac japan's pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. the following table presents a summary of operating results for aflac japan for the years ended december 31.

in yen terms, aflac japan's net premium income decreased in 2017, with growth in third sector premium more than offset by an anticipated reduction in first sector premium due to savings products reaching premium paid-up status during the year. net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, decreased in 2017. the increases in net investment income for u.s. dollar-denominated investments driven by the strengthening u.s. dollar were offset by lower re-investment rates and increased amortized hedge costs.
annualized premiums in force at december 31, 2017, were 1.55 trillion yen, compared with 1.61 trillion yen in 2016 and 1.62 trillion yen in 2015. the decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of 3.4% in 2017 was driven primarily by limited-pay policies becoming paid-up during the year. the decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of .7% in 2016 reflects the net effect of sales of new policies combined with limited-pay policies becoming paid-up and the

persistency of aflac japan's business. the increase in annualized premiums in force in yen of 1.5% in 2015 reflects the sales of new policies combined with the high persistency of aflac japan's business. annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $13.7 billion in 2017, $13.8 billion in 2016, and $13.4 billion in 2015.
aflac japan's investment portfolios include u.s. dollar-denominated securities and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). in years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. in years when the yen weakens, translating u.s. dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms.
the following table illustrates the effect of translating aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. in order to compare the current year to the prior year without the impact of foreign currency, the current year's income statement is translated at the prior year's average exchange rate.

in 2017, the benefit ratio decreased compared to the prior year. this was primarily due to the change in mix of first and third sector business as first sector products become paid-up and a de-emphasis on sales of first sector saving products, as well as continued favorable claims experience, and a 6 billion yen reserve adjustment to a closed block of business in 2016. in 2017, the operating expense ratio increased primarily due to lower premium income impacted by first sector products becoming paid-up. expenses incurred remained consistent with the prior year. in total for 2017, the pretax operating profit margin increased, reflecting the decrease in the benefit ratio partially offset by a smaller increase in the expense ratio. for 2018, the company anticipates the aflac japan pretax operating profit margin (calculated by dividing operating earnings by operating revenues) to remain stable.

(1) includes term and whole life the foundation of aflac japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, third sector products, which include cancer, medical and income support insurance products. sales of third sector products on a yen basis increased 4.1% during 2017, compared with 2016. aflac japan has been focusing more on promotion of cancer and medical insurance products in this low-interest-rate environment. these products are less interest-rate sensitive and more profitable compared to first sector products. with continued cost pressure on japan's health care system, the company expects the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future and that the medical and cancer insurance products aflac japan provides will continue to be an important part of its product portfolio.
as a result of the interest rate policy in japan, aflac japan has taken significant actions to limit sales of certain first sector products, including ways and child endowment. first sector product sales were down 75.0% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting the company's actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products that are more interest-sensitive. aflac japan's focus will remain on less interest-sensitive third sector products.
independent corporate agencies and individual agencies contributed 42.8% of total new annualized premium sales for aflac japan in 2017, compared with 46.7% in 2016 and 47.0% in 2015. affiliated corporate agencies, which include japan post, contributed 52.0% of total new annualized premium sales in 2017, compared with 44.4% in 2016 and 38.1% in 2015. japan post offers aflac's cancer insurance products in more than 20,000 post offices. the company believes this alliance with japan post has and will further benefit its cancer insurance sales. in 2017, aflac japan recruited 174 new sales agencies. at december 31, 2017, aflac japan was represented by more than 10,900 sales agencies, with approximately 109,200 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies.
at december 31, 2017, aflac japan had agreements to sell its products at 374 banks, approximately 90% of the total number of banks in japan. bank channel sales accounted for 5.2% of new annualized premium sales in 2017 for aflac japan, compared with 8.9% in 2016 and 14.9% in 2015.

as part of the company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, aflac japan invests in yen and u.s. dollar-denominated investments. yen-denominated investments primarily consist of jgbs and public and private fixed-maturity securities. aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investments include fixed-maturity investments and growth assets, including public equities and alternative investments in limited partnerships or similar investment vehicles. aflac japan has been investing in both publicly-traded and privately originated u.s. dollar-denominated investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed-maturity securities and loans, and has entered into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of a portion of the u.s. dollar investments.

the increase in the aflac japan new money yield in 2017 was primarily due to increases in yen interest rates during much of the investment period as well as increased allocations to higher yielding asset classes.

the benefit ratio decreased slightly in 2017, compared with 2016, reflecting continuing favorable trends and mix-of-business shifts towards lower loss ratio lines of business. the operating expense ratio was somewhat elevated compared with 2016, reflecting larger investment in the aflac u.s. platform. the higher expenses were partially offset by decreasing amortization and commission expense ratios. therefore, the pretax operating profit margin (calculated by dividing operating earnings by operating revenues) increased slightly in 2017, compared with 2016. in 2018, the company expects benefit ratios to be relatively stable to 2017 levels, and expects somewhat higher expense ratios reflecting further investments in its u.s. platform, and reduced investment portfolio revenues due to the company's planned reduction of capital to lower risk-based capital (rbc) ratios. (see the capital resources and liquidity section of this md&a for further discussion of the planned reduction of rbc.)

the addition of group products has expanded aflac u.s.'s reach and enabled aflac u.s. to generate more sales opportunities with larger employers and through brokers and sales agent channels. the company anticipates that the appeal of aflac u.s. group products will continue to enhance opportunities to connect with larger businesses and their
53
employees. the aflac u.s. portfolio of group and individual products offers businesses the opportunity to give their employees a more valuable and comprehensive selection of benefit options.
in 2017, the aflac u.s. sales forces included an average of more than 8,800 u.s. agents, including brokers, who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. the company believes that this average weekly producer equivalent metric allows sales management to monitor progress and needs.
one day paysm is a claims initiative that aflac u.s. has focused on to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. the company believes that this claims practice enhances the aflac u.s. brand reputation and the trust policyholders have in aflac, and it helps aflac stand out from competitors.
aflac u.s. products provide cash benefits that can be used to help with increasing out-of-pocket medical expenses, help cover household costs, or protect against income and asset loss. group products and relationships with insurance brokers that handle the larger-case market are helping aflac u.s. expand its reach selling to larger businesses. aflac u.s. is regularly evaluating the marketplace to identify opportunities to bring the most relevant, cost-effective products to customers. the company believes the need for its products remains very strong, and aflac u.s. continues to work on enhancing its distribution capabilities to access employers of all sizes, including initiatives that benefit the field force and the broker community. at the same time, the company is seeking opportunities to leverage its brand strength and attractive product portfolio in the evolving health care environment.
u.s. regulatory environment healthcare reform legislation the affordable care act (aca), federal health care legislation, was intended to give americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance and gave the u.s. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. while the aca was enacted in 2010, the major elements of the law became effective on january 1, 2014. the aca included major changes to the u.s. health care insurance marketplace. among other changes, the aca included an individual medical insurance coverage mandate (which has since been repealed effective 2019 by the tax act), provided for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, created health insurance exchanges, and addressed coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. it also imposed an excise tax on certain high cost plans, known as the "cadillac tax," that is currently scheduled to begin in 2020. the aca also included changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and altered federal and state regulation of health insurers. the aca, as enacted, does not require material changes in the design of the company's insurance products. however, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the company's sales model, financial condition and results of operations. the united states congress has considered and may continue to consider legislation that would repeal and replace key provisions of the aca. there can be no assurance that any legislation affecting the aca will be passed by congress, nor as to the ultimate timing or provisions of any such legislation, nor as to the effect of any such legislation on the design or marketability of the company's insurance products.
president trump signed an executive order in october 2017 directing federal regulatory agencies to review and modify certain regulations issued under the aca. the stated objectives of the executive order are to increase competition and consumer choices in health care markets, and to lower costs for health care, by making association health plans available to more employers, allowing employers to make better use of health reimbursement arrangements, and expanding coverage through short-term insurance. the executive order tasks three federal agencies, the departments of labor (dol), treasury, and health and human services (hhs) with reviewing current rules and developing guidance to implement the order. while the details of any proposed modifications will not be known until further action by the agencies, the company anticipates that the executive order will not have a significant impact on the availability or marketability of its products.
tax reform legislation the tax act was signed into law on december 22, 2017. among other things, effective january 1, 2018, the tax act reduced the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated or reduced certain deductions and credits and limited the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.
the tax act also transitions international corporate taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system, which in light of the current tax treatment of aflac japan as a branch has the effect of subjecting the earnings of aflac
54
japan to japan taxation and subjecting the company's other earnings, including the consolidated earnings of the parent company, to u.s. taxation. the treatment of aflac japan as a branch for u.s. tax purposes is not expected to change upon the completion of its conversion from a branch structure to a subsidiary structure for legal purposes, which conversion is currently anticipated to be completed as early as april 1, 2018.
aflac u.s. prices its business on an internal rate of return basis. the aflac u.s. business has a financial structure that the company expects to be neutral on a pricing basis from these tax changes. the aflac u.s. products have high initial costs for marketing, underwriting and administration, which will have less tax relief under the changes and will increase the amount required to invest in new business. in addition, the company expects that rbc requirements will increase on an after-tax basis, being another source of initial funding required for these products. the tax basis for reserves and dac may also change the timing of tax payments in an accelerated or unfavorable direction. all of these effects will offset a favorable lower tax rate on income in later years. the overall impact is expected to be neutral on a pricing basis from these various effects.
the tax act changes are effective on january 1, 2018. however, because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment, during the period ended december 31, 2017, the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded, as its current reasonable estimate, a net deferred tax liability reduction of $1.9 billion as of that date. for information on the effects of the tax act during the period ended december 31, 2017, see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in this report. for information on the conversion of aflac japan from a branch to a subsidiary, see general business under item 1, business, in this report.
dodd-frank act title vii of the dodd-frank act and regulations issued thereunder, in particular rules to require central clearing for certain types of derivatives, may have an impact on aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of aflac japan. in addition, in 2015 and 2016, six u.s. financial regulators, including the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc), issued final rules regarding the exchange of initial margin (im) and variation margin (vm) for uncleared swaps that impose greater obligations on swap dealers regarding uncleared swaps with certain counterparties, such as aflac. the requirements of such rules with respect to vm, as well as similar regulations in europe, became effective on march 1, 2017. full compliance with respect to all counterparties was required by september 1, 2017. the requirements of such rules with respect to im are currently being phased in and will be fully implemented by september 1, 2020. in october of 2017, the cftc and the european commission each finalized comparability determinations that permit certain swap dealers who are subject to both regulatory margin regimes to take advantage of substituted compliance by complying with one set of margin requirements. the margin requirements are expected to result in more stringent collateral requirements and to affect other aspects of aflac's derivatives activity.
the dodd-frank act also established a federal insurance office (fio) under the u.s. treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. traditionally, u.s. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. the fio does not directly regulate the insurance industry, but under dodd-frank it has the power to preempt state insurance regulations that are inconsistent with international agreements reached by the federal government, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. in december 2013, the fio released a report entitled "how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states." the report was required by the dodd-frank act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. the report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. some of the recommendations outlined in the fio report released in december 2013 have been implemented. the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act, signed into law in january 2015, simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. the fio has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers. the new presidential administration in the united states and congress have stated proposals to reform or repeal certain provisions of the dodd-frank act, some of which have been implemented. the company cannot predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, such proposals will have on aflac's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
insurance guaranty laws under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, aflac is subject to assessments, based on the share of business it writes in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. in the united states, some states permit member insurers to recover
55
assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. the company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. in most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction.
aflac u.s. investments the level of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and other factors.

generally, declines in fair values can be a result of changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rate, and changes in net spreads driven by a broad market move or a change in the issuer's underlying credit quality. as the company believes these issues have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest, the company views these changes in fair value to be temporary and does not believe it is necessary to impair the carrying value of these

securities. see the unrealized investment gains and losses section in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions, including perpetual securities, and other corporate investments.

(2) middle market loans are carried at amortized cost the company invests in senior secured bank loans and middle market loans primarily to u.s. corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. the bank loan and middle market loan investment programs are managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class and require a minimum average portfolio rating of low bb and a minimum single investment rating of low b from one of the nrsros. the objectives of these programs include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates and hedge costs through the acquisition of floating rate assets.

the company maintains an allocation to higher yielding corporate bonds within the aflac japan and aflac u.s. portfolios. most of these securities were rated below-investment-grade at the time of purchase, but the company also purchased several that were rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below-investment-grade risk profiles. the objective of this allocation was to enhance the company's yield on invested assets and further diversify credit risk. all investments must have a minimum rating of low bb using the company's above described rating methodology and are managed by the company's internal credit portfolio management team.
securities by type of issuance the company has investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. the company's ability to sell either type of security is a function of overall market liquidity which is impacted by, among other things, the amount of outstanding securities of a particular issuer or issuance, trading history of the issue or issuer, overall market conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting the specific issue or issuer.

(1) includes rule 144a securities the perpetual securities the company holds were largely issued by banks that are integral to the financial markets of the sovereign country of the issuer. as a result of the issuer's position within the economy of the sovereign country, the company's perpetual securities may be subject to a higher risk of nationalization of their issuers in connection with capital injections from an issuer's sovereign government. the company cannot be assured that such capital support will extend to all levels of an issuer's capital structure. in addition, certain governments or regulators may consider imposing interest and principal payment restrictions on issuers of hybrid securities to preserve cash and preserve the issuer's capital. beyond the cash flow impact that additional deferrals would have on the company's portfolio, such deferrals could result in ratings downgrades of the affected securities, which in turn could result in a reduction of fair value of the securities and increase the company's regulatory capital requirements. the company considers these factors in its credit review process.

(1)principal payments in yen and interest payments in dollars aflac japan has a portfolio of privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds. aflac japan's investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-japanese issuers, are rated investment grade at purchase and have longer maturities, thereby allowing the company to improve asset/liability matching and overall investment returns. these securities are generally either privately negotiated arrangements or issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required. many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. these may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of the company's notes.
hedging activities aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investments most of aflac japan's cash, investments, and liabilities are yen-denominated. however, aflac japan also owns u.s. dollar-denominated investments, a portion of which aflac japan hedges with foreign currency forwards and options. the currency risk being hedged is generally based on fair value of hedged investments. the following chart summarizes the u.s. dollar-denominated investments held by aflac japan as of december 31.

as of december 31, 2017, aflac japan had $9.3 billion outstanding notional amounts of foreign currency forwards and $8.4 billion outstanding notional amounts of foreign currency options, of which none were in-the-money, hedging the u.s. dollar-denominated investments, resulting in the unhedged fair value of the u.s. dollar japan portfolio of $13.0 billion, excluding certain u.s. dollar-denominated assets shown in the table above as a result of consolidation that have been economically converted to yen using derivatives.
foreign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled, which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination. the company recognized net cash settlements of $(747) million, $1.3 billion and $(2.1) billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, associated with the currency derivatives used for hedging aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investments.

(5) based on annualized amortized hedge costs divided by average fx forward notional for the period net investment hedge the company's investment in aflac japan is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure, the company has taken several courses of action. first, aflac japan maintains certain unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of the company's investment in aflac japan. second, the company has designated the majority of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities (notes payable and loans) as non-derivative hedging instruments and certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the company's net investment in aflac japan. the company makes its accounting designation of net investment hedge at the beginning of each quarter. if the total of the designated parent company non-derivative and derivative notional is equal to or less than the company's net investment in aflac japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the currency exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. the company's net investment hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for the hedge of the company's net investment in aflac japan, the company has designated certain of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities and foreign currency forwards and options as accounting hedges of its net investment in aflac japan. the company's consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2017, with hedging instruments comprised of $1.4 billion of yen-denominated debt and $.4 billion of foreign currency forwards and options, compared with a hedge of $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2016, with hedging instruments comprised of $.3 billion of yen-denominated debt and $1.0 billion of foreign currency forwards and options.
the dollar values of the company's yen-denominated net assets, including economic yen-denominated investments for net investment hedging purposes as discussed above, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period exchange rates) for the years ended december 31:
(in millions)                                             2017                  2016
aflac japan net assets                                         $19,962                  $16,215
aflac japan unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated net assets        (10,933   )               (9,694   )
consolidated yen-denominated net assets (liabilities)           $9,029                   $6,521
the yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen-denominated net asset position as discussed in the currency risk subsection of item 7a. as disclosed in that section, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain vies requires that the company derecognize its yen-denominated investment in the vie and recognize the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps. while these u.s. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the u.s. dollar-denominated investment and the cross-currency
63
swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of the company's investment in aflac japan. similarly, the combination of the u.s. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that the company has entered into economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of the company's investment in aflac japan.

policyholder protection policyholder protection corporation the japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. legislation enacted regarding the framework of the life insurance policyholder protection corporation (lippc) included government fiscal measures supporting the lippc. on march 30, 2012, the diet approved legislation to enhance the stability of the lippc by extending the government's fiscal support of the lippc through march 2017. on november 25, 2016, japan's diet passed legislation that again extends the government's fiscal support of the lippc through march 2022. effective april 2014, the annual lippc contribution amount for the total life industry was lowered from 40 billion yen to 33 billion yen.
guaranty fund assessments under u.s. state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. the amount of the guaranty fund assessment that an insurer is assessed is based on its proportionate share of premiums in that state.
as of december 31, 2017, the company has estimated and recognized the impact of its share of guaranty fund assessments resulting from the liquidation of a long-term care insurer. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the assessment.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2017, the company had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on the company's balance sheet.
capital resources and liquidity aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the parent company through dividends and management fees. the following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended december 31.

(1) includes securities of $622 at fair value which had a value of $656 at amortized cost the primary uses of cash by the parent company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses. the parent company's sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. for additional information, see the financing activities subsection of this md&a.
the parent company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. in august 2016, the company filed a shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities that allows the company to conduct public offerings of bonds in japan, including yen-denominated samurai notes, up to 200 billion yen or its equivalent through august 2018. the shelf registration statement is for possible public offerings in japan, but the bonds issued under the shelf may be transferred by the bondholders to u.s. persons in compliance with u.s. law. the company filed a shelf
65
registration statement with the sec in may 2015 that allows the company to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time until may 2018. the company believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. for additional information, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the principal sources of cash for the company's insurance operations are premiums and investment income. the primary uses of cash by the company's insurance operations are investments, policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends. both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.
when making an investment decision, the company's first consideration is based on product needs. the company's investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. these objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of the company's business, the company has adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.
as a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. the company expects its future cash flows from premiums and its investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet its cash needs for benefits and expenses.
as of december 31, 2017, the parent company and aflac had four lines of credit with third parties as well as two intercompany lines of credit. for additional information on the company's lines of credit, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
as part of the fhlb financing arrangement as discussed previously in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a, aflac u.s. borrowed and repaid $64 million during 2017.
the company's financial statements convey its financing arrangements during the periods presented. the company has not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in its balance sheet or disclosed herein. the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2017. the company has not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. see notes 1, 3, and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company's securities lending and derivative activities. with the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes, the company does not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in its liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. the company's cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure.
the following table presents the estimated payments by period of the company's major contractual obligations as of december 31, 2017. the company translated its yen-denominated obligations using the december 31, 2017, exchange rate. actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $15 have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable.
(1)liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2017.
(2)the estimated payments due by period reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits. these projected cash outflows are based on assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions comparable with the company's experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $244,395 exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $81,857. the company has made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.
(3)includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. actual amounts and timing of unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above.
(4)not applicable for more information on the company's major contractual obligations, see the applicable note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.
consolidated cash flows the company translates cash flows for aflac japan's yen-denominated items into u.s. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. in years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.

prudent portfolio management dictates that the company attempts to match the duration of its assets with the duration of its liabilities. currently, when the company's fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, the long-term nature of the company's business and its strong cash flows provide the company with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. from time to time or when market opportunities arise, the company disposes of selected fixed-maturity and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or re-balance its portfolio. as a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. dispositions before maturity were approximately 5% of the annual average investment portfolio of fixed maturities and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with 7% in 2016 and 5% in 2015.
financing activities consolidated cash used by financing activities was $2.1 billion in 2017, $1.6 billion in 2016 and $2.2 billion in 2015.
in january 2017, the parent company issued 60.0 billion yen of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of .932% per annum, payable semi-annually, and have a 10-year maturity. these notes may only be redeemed before maturity, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain changes affecting u.s. taxation, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the issuance.
in february 2017, the parent company extinguished $650 million of 2.65% senior notes upon their maturity.
in october 2017, the parent company issued 60.0 billion yen of subordinated debentures through a u.s. public debt offering. the debentures bear interest at an initial rate of 2.108% per annum through october 22, 2027, or earlier redemption. thereafter, the rate of the interest of the debentures will be reset every five years at a rate of interest equal to the then-current jpy 5-year swap offered rate plus 205 basis points. the debentures are payable semi-annually in arrears and have a 30-year maturity. the debentures are redeemable (i) at any time, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain tax events or certain rating agency events, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the debentures or (ii) in 10 years, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. in november 2017, the parent company used a portion of net proceeds from the debenture offering to redeem $500 million of the parent company's 5.50% subordinated debentures due 2052. the pretax non-operating expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $13 million.
in september 2016, the parent company issued two series of senior notes totaling $700 million through a u.s. public debt offering. the first series, which totaled $300 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.875% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a 10-year maturity. the second series, which totaled $400 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a 30-year maturity.
in september 2016, the parent company entered into two series of senior unsecured term loan facilities totaling 30.0 billion yen. the first series, which totaled 5.0 billion yen, bears an interest rate per annum equal to the tibor, or alternate tibor, if applicable, plus the applicable tibor margin. the applicable margin ranges between .20% and .60%, depending on the parent company's debt ratings as of the date of determination. the second series, which totaled 25.0 billion yen, bears an interest rate per annum equal to tibor, or alternate tibor, if applicable, plus the applicable tibor margin. the applicable margin ranges between .35% and .75%, depending on the parent company's debt ratings as of the date of determination.

in december 2016, the parent company completed a tender offer in which it extinguished $176 million principal of its 6.90% senior notes due 2039 and $193 million principal of its 6.45% senior notes due 2040. the pretax non-operating loss due to the early redemption of these notes was $137 million ($89 million after-tax, or $.21 per diluted share).
in september 2016, the parent company extinguished 8.0 billion yen of 2.26% fixed rate uridashi notes upon their maturity and in july 2016, the parent company extinguished 15.8 billion yen of 1.84% fixed rate samurai notes upon their maturity.
in august 2015, the parent company extinguished $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. in august 2015, the parent company extinguished a 5.0 billion yen loan at their maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). in july 2015, the parent company extinguished a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date).
in march 2015, the parent company issued two series of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion through a u.s. public debt offering. the first series, which totaled $550 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.40% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. the second series, which totaled $450 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. the parent company has entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the u.s. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. by entering into these cross-currency swaps, the parent company economically converted its $550 million liability into a 67.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.40% in dollars to .24% in yen, and the parent company economically converted its $450 million liability into a 55.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 3.25% in dollars to .82% in yen. in april 2015, the parent company used $1.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes that were issued in march 2015 to redeem all of its $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes due may 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes.

in january 2018, the board of directors announced a 15.6% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, effective with the first quarter of 2018. the first quarter 2018 cash dividend of $.52 per share is payable on march 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 21, 2018.
regulatory restrictions aflac and caic are domiciled in nebraska and are subject to its regulations. the nebraska department of insurance imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances to the parent company. under nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the nebraska department of insurance is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. in addition, the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid to the parent company. after the planned japan branch conversion as early as april 1, 2018, nebraska insurance department approval will not be needed for activities of the new subsidiary. (see below for discussion of restrictions imposed by japanese insurance regulators.) a life insurance company's statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic), as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile. statutory accounting rules are different from u.s. gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. similar laws apply in new york, the domiciliary jurisdiction of aflac's new york insurance subsidiary. as of december 2016, caic was redomiciled from south carolina to nebraska.
the continued long-term growth of the company's business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of its insurance operations. aflac's insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, capital contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. the naic's risk-based capital (rbc) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. the rbc formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer's operations. aflac's company action level rbc ratio was 831% as of december 31, 2017, compared with 894% at december 31, 2016. aflac's rbc ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. as of december 31, 2017, aflac's total adjusted capital of $12.0 billion exceeded the company action level required capital and surplus of $1.4 billion by $10.6 billion. the u.s. tax act will have a negative impact on aflac's u.s.-only rbc ratio. this reduction occurs as a result of writing down deferred tax assets and the increase in required capital due to the reduction in tax rates. however, aflac expects to recover from this negative impact over a period of three to five years through additional statutory income, assuming that the additional income is fully retained.
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the parent company by aflac without prior approval of nebraska's director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. dividends declared by aflac during 2018 in excess of $2.6 billion would be considered extraordinary and require such approval. subsequent to the japan branch conversion to a subsidiary, the company
70
intends to use extraordinary dividends as needed to actively manage to appropriate rbc levels that are lower yet sufficient to maintain ratings and support prudent capital management. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the nebraska department of insurance on the company's statutory capital and surplus.
the naic considers its solvency modernization initiative (smi) process relating to updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework to be ongoing. the smi has focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. many of these key issues have been finalized and/or are near completion; however, the naic still has some ongoing initiatives related to smi, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements and group supervision as well as risk-based capital. in addition, the naic is also considering changes to investment risk factors. any negative developments by the naic in these areas could result in increased capital requirements for the company.
aflac is subject to the naic's own risk and solvency assessment (orsa), effective january 1, 2015. through the orsa requirements, aflac is expected to regularly, no less than annually, conduct an orsa to assess the adequacy of its risk management framework, and its current and estimated projected future solvency position; internally document the process and results of the assessment; and provide a confidential high-level orsa summary report annually to the lead state commissioner if the insurer is a member of an insurance group. in november 2017, aflac filed its orsa report with the nebraska department of insurance.
in addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by u.s. insurance regulators, japan's financial services agency (fsa) may not allow profit repatriations from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. after the planned japan branch conversion as early as april 1, 2018, the new japan subsidiary will be required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the parent company. under these criteria, dividend capacity at the japan subsidiary will be defined as retained earnings plus other capital reserve less net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. these dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the solvency margin ratio (smr). the fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the smr. aflac japan's smr is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange rate changes, therefore the company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. in the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing smr to decline, the company has two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities in the amounts of 100 billion yen and 55 billion yen, respectively, and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately 110 billion yen as a capital contingency plan. (see notes 8 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.)
the company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japan's smr. for example, the company employs policy reserve matching (prm) investment strategies, which is a japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. in order for a prm-designated asset to be held at amortized cost, there are certain criteria that must be maintained. the primary criteria relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. if the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing, then a certain portion of the assets must be re-classified as available for sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. to rebalance, assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range, resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. for u.s. gaap, prm investments are categorized as available for sale. the company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its u.s. dollar-denominated investments. (see notes 3, 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively.)
as of december 31, 2017, aflac japan's smr was 1,064%, compared with 945% at december 31, 2016. aflac's smr ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. the fsa has been conducting field testing with the insurance industry concerning the introduction of an economic value-based solvency regime. the field testing will assist the fsa in determining if an economic value-based solvency regime in japan will be appropriate for the insurance industry.
payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac u.s. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. the following table details aflac japan remittances for the years ended december 31.

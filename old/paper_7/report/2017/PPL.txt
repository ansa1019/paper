business strategy
(all registrants)
following the june 1, 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply, ppl completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model operating seven diverse, high-performing utilities. these utilities are located in the u.k., pennsylvania and kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. the company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions ppl well for continued growth and success.
ppl's businesses of wpd, ppl electric, lg&e and ku plan to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. these businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the u.s. and rav in the u.k., driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for lke, lg&e and
36
ku, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through at least 2020 at ppl electric.
for the u.s. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual ferc formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. in kentucky, the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in addition, the kpsc requires a utility to obtain a cpcn prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. although such kpsc proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the kpsc, in awarding a cpcn, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. in pennsylvania, the ferc transmission formula rate, dsic mechanism, smart meter rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.
rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in earnings growth for the foreseeable future. in 2017, earnings from the u.k. regulated segment declined mainly due to the unfavorable impact of lower gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rates. rav growth is expected in the u.k. regulated segment during the riio-ed1 price control period which ends on march 31, 2023 and to result in earnings growth in 2018 through at least 2020. see "item 1. business - segment information - u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on riio-ed1.
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. in addition, the registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. see "financial condition - risk management" below for further information.
earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. because wpd's earnings represent such a significant portion of ppl's consolidated earnings, ppl enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the gbp versus the u.s. dollar. these hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under gaap. see "financial and operational developments - u.k. membership in european union" for additional discussion of the u.k. earnings hedging activity.
the u.k. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the u.s. dollar to the extent of their u.s. dollar denominated debt. to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.
as discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (u.k., u.s. federal and state). this is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.
financial and operational developments u.s. tax reform (all registrants)
on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law the tcja. substantially all of the provisions of the tcja are effective for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017. the tcja includes significant changes to the taxation of corporations, including provisions specifically applicable to regulated public utilities. the more significant changes that impact the registrants are:
•   the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective january 1, 2018;
•   the exclusion from u.s. federal taxable income of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and the associated "transition tax;"
•   limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense, with an exception to these limitations for regulated public utilities;
•   full current year expensing of capital expenditures with an exception for regulated public utilities that qualify for the exception to the interest expense limitation; and
37
•   the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. for non-regulated businesses, the tcja generally provides for full expensing of property acquired after september 27, 2017.
as a result, ppl expects cash flows at its domestic utilities to decline as the benefit of the lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate is passed through to its utility customers. in addition, as ppl is not a current federal tax payer because of available net operating loss carry forwards, there is no immediate corporate cash benefit associated with the lower tax rate. the lack of cash benefit resulted in degradation of ppl's projected financial credit metrics. in an effort to maintain its current credit rating, ppl, among other things, currently plans to issue about $1 billion of equity in 2018. this compares to ppl's actual 2017 equity issuances of $482 million.
the changes enacted by the tcja were recorded as an adjustment to the registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in "income taxes" on the statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 as follows:
ppl           ppl electric         lke           lg&amp;e       ku income tax expense (benefit)   $321          $(13          )      $112          $-             $-
the components of these adjustments are discussed below:
reduction of u.s. federal corporate income tax rate at the date of enactment, the registrants' deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new u.s. federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. for ppl's regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes were, in large part, recorded as an offset to either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability and will be reflected in future rates charged to customers. the rate reduction on non-regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded as an adjustment to the registrants' deferred tax provision, and have been reflected in "income taxes" on the statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 as follows:
ppl           ppl electric         lke           lg&amp;e       ku income tax expense (benefit)   $220          $(13          )      $112          $-             $-
for ppl's u.s. regulated operations, reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% under the provisions of the tcja may result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers over a period of time. the tcja includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. potential refunds of other deferred taxes will be determined by the registrants' regulators. the balance sheets at december 31, 2017 reflect the increase to the registrants' net regulatory liabilities as a result of the tcja as follows:
ppl             ppl electric         lke             lg&amp;e       ku net increase in regulatory liabilities   $2,185          $1,019               $1,166          $532           $634
transition tax the tcja included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective january 1, 2018. in the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on ppl's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. these earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to ppl of approximately $462 million. as the ppl consolidated u.s. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, the foreign tax credits associated with the deemed dividend were recorded as a deferred tax asset. however, it is expected that under the tcja, the current and prior year foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be fully realizable.
as a result, the net deferred income tax expense impact of the deemed repatriation was $101 million and was recorded in "income taxes" on the ppl statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 and "deferred tax liabilities" on the ppl balance sheet at december 31, 2017.
see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information.
u.k. membership in european union (ppl)
on march 29, 2017, the u.k. formally notified the european council of the european union (eu) of its intent to withdraw from the eu, thereby commencing the two-year negotiation period to establish the terms of that withdrawal under article 50 of the lisbon treaty. article 50 specifies that if a member state decides to withdraw from the eu, it must notify the european
38
council of its intention to leave the eu, negotiate the terms of withdrawal and establish the legal grounds for its future relationship with the eu. article 50 provides two years from the date of the article 50 notification to conclude negotiations. failure to complete negotiations within two years, unless negotiations are extended, would result in the treaties governing the eu no longer being applicable to the u.k. with there being no agreement in place governing the u.k.'s relationship with the eu. under the terms of article 50, negotiations can only be extended beyond two years if all of the 27 remaining eu states agree to an extension. any withdrawal agreement will need to be approved by both the european council and the european parliament. there remains significant uncertainty as to the ultimate outcome of the withdrawal negotiations and the related impact on the u.k. economy and the gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rate.
ppl has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to the company's u.k. earnings. as of february 20, 2018, ppl's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2018 at an average rate of $1.34 per gbp, 100% hedged for 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per gbp and 35% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.46 per gbp.
ppl cannot predict either the short-term or long-term impact to foreign exchange rates or long-term impact on ppl's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the u.k. government to withdraw from the eu, although such impacts could be significant.
regulatory requirements

(ppl)
riio-2 framework review in july 2017, ofgem published an open letter commencing its riio-2 framework review, which covers all u.k. gas and electricity, transmission and distribution price controls. the purpose of this framework review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving u.k. energy sector.
the letter sets out the context for the development of the next price controls, riio-2, and seeks views from stakeholders on the riio-2 framework. responses to the open letter were published in september 2017 and will be used to guide the full riio-2 framework consultation which is expected to be published in march of 2018. the promulgation of sector specific price controls will begin with the gas and electricity transmission networks, with electricity distribution price control work scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time ofgem plans to publish its riio-ed2 strategy consultation document.
the current electricity distribution price control, riio-ed1, continues through march 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this riio-2 consultation process. ppl cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final riio-ed2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations.
riio-ed1 mid-period review in december 2017, ofgem initiated a consultation on a potential riio-ed1 mid-period review (mpr). the riio framework allows for a mpr of outputs halfway through the price control. ofgem is consulting on three potential approaches:
•   whether to implement a mpr as currently defined;
•   whether to implement a mpr with an extension for wpd rail electrification; and
•   whether to implement a mpr with a significant extension of scope to include financial parameters.
ofgem's initial assessment as set forth in its december 2017 consultation publication is that a mpr as currently defined under riio-ed1 is not required. in addition, ofgem recognized that the rail electrification is outside the scope of the mpr and that implementing a mpr to include financial parameters could undermine the stability of the regulatory regime. the consultation, however, requests interested party comments on those conclusions. the period for submission of comments to the consultation closed on february 2, 2018. formal consultation responses have been submitted by ppl and wpd. a decision on whether to
39
proceed with a mpr is expected in spring 2018. if ofgem decides to launch a mpr, it will consult on detailed proposals in summer 2018 and any associated changes to dno licenses would be in place by april 1, 2019. although, ppl cannot predict the outcome of the consultation process, a mpr is not expected to have a significant impact on ppl's financial condition or results of operations.
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
the businesses of lke, lg&e and ku are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to ccrs, ghg, elgs and the clean power plan. see note 6, note 13 and note 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. these and other stringent environmental requirements led ppl, lke, lg&e and ku to retire approximately 800 mw of coal-fired generating plants in kentucky, primarily in 2015. additionally, ku anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the e.w. brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw.
also as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, lke projects $828 million ($335 million at lg&e and $493 million at ku) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. see ppl's "financial condition - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures", note 6 and note 13 for additional information.
rate case proceedings
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
in november 2016, lg&e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. lg&e's and ku's applications included requests for cpcns for implementing an advanced metering system program and a distribution automation program.
in april and may 2017, lg&e and ku, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the kpsc, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with lg&e base electricity rates of $59 million, lg&e base gas rates of $8 million and ku base electricity rates of $55 million, reflecting a return on equity of 9.75%, the withdrawal of lg&e's and ku's request for a cpcn for the advanced metering system and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates.
in june 2017, the kpsc issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in april and may 2017. the orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with lg&e base electricity rates of $57 million, lg&e base gas rates of $7 million, ku base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7%. consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved lg&e's and ku's request for implementing a distribution automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a cpcn for the advanced metering system program. the orders also approved new depreciation rates for lg&e and ku that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ($4 million for lg&e and $11 million for ku) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to pp&e. the orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at lg&e and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at ku. the new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective july 1, 2017. on june 23, 2017, the kpsc issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of lg&e's and ku's existing approved ecr plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for ccr projects and 10% for all other ecr approved projects, effective with bills issued in august 2017. the annual impact of the new authorized return for ecr projects is not expected to be significant.
(lke and ku)
on september 29, 2017, ku filed a request seeking approval from the vscc to increase annual virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. ku's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective july 1, 2018.
(ppl, lke and ku)
in october 2016, ku filed a request with the ferc to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of ccr impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. in december 2016, the ferc accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective december 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. in march 2017, the parties reached a
40
settlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. in june 2017, a ferc judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective july 1, 2017. in august 2017, the ferc issued a final order approving the settlement.
tcja impact on lg&e and ku rates (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
on december 21, 2017, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. submitted a complaint with the kpsc against lg&e and ku, as well as other utility companies in kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the tcja reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. the complaint requested the kpsc to issue an order requiring lg&e and ku to begin deferring, as of january 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.
on december 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the kpsc ordered lg&e and ku to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings.
on january 8, 2018, lg&e and ku responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the tcja will result in savings for their customers. lg&e and ku have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of december 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ecr, dsm and lg&e's glt rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. lg&e and ku also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the april 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers.
on january 29, 2018, lg&e and ku reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the tcja to their customers. the savings will be distributed through their ecr, dsm and lg&e's glt rate mechanisms beginning in march 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from april 1, 2018 through april 30, 2019. the estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in ku electricity revenues, $69 million in lg&e electricity revenues and $17 million in lg&e gas revenues for the period january 2018 through april 2019. ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in lg&e's and ku's next kentucky base rate case. lg&e and ku have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. the settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the kpsc. an order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018.
additionally, on january 8, 2018, the vscc ordered ku, as well as other utilities in virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate.
the ferc has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the tcja.
lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
tcja impact on ppl electric rates (ppl and ppl electric)
the puc issued a secretarial letter on february 12, 2018 regarding the tcja. the commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of january 1, 2018. in addition, the secretarial letter requests certain pennsylvania regulated utilities, including ppl electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the tcja on ppl electric's income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. ppl electric's responses are due to the puc not later than march 9, 2018.
the ferc has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the tcja.

(a)   during 2017, ppl recorded an increase in valuation allowances of $23 million primarily related to foreign tax credits recorded in 2016. the future utilization of these credits is expected to be lower as a result of the tcja.
during 2017 and 2016, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense of $16 million and $13 million for valuation allowances primarily related to increased pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized.
during 2015, ppl recorded $24 million of deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation allowances. ppl recorded state deferred income tax expense of $12 million primarily related to increased pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized and $12 million of federal deferred income tax expense primarily related to federal tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire as a result of lower future taxable earnings due to the extension of bonus depreciation.
(b)   during 2015, ppl recorded a $9 million income tax benefit related to a planned amendment of a prior period tax return and a $12 million income tax benefit related to the settlement of an irs audit for the tax years 1998-2011.
(c)   during 2017, ppl recorded a federal income tax benefit of $35 million primarily attributable to uk pension contributions.
during 2017, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense of $83 million primarily related to enactment of the tcja. the enacted tax law included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective january 1, 2018. in the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on ppl's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. these earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to ppl of approximately $462 million, including $205 million of foreign tax credits. as the ppl consolidated u.s. group had a taxable loss for 2017, inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, these credits were recorded as a deferred tax asset. however, it is expected that under the tcja, only $83 million of the $205 million of foreign tax credits will be realized in the carry forward period. accordingly, a valuation allowance on the current year foreign tax credits in the amount of $122 million has been recorded to reflect the reduction in the future utilization of the credits. the foreign tax credits
45
associated with the deemed repatriation result in a gross carryforward and corresponding deferred tax asset of $205 million offset by a valuation allowance of $122 million.
ppl recorded lower income taxes in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily attributable to foreign tax credit carryforwards, arising from a decision to amend prior year tax returns to claim foreign tax credits rather than deduct foreign taxes. this decision was prompted by changes to the company's most recent business plan.
(d)   the u.k. finance act 2016, enacted in september 2016, reduced the u.k. statutory income tax rate effective april 1, 2020 from 18% to 17%. as a result, ppl reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $42 million deferred income tax benefit during 2016.
the u.k. finance act 2015, enacted in november 2015, reduced the u.k. statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective april 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective april 1, 2020. as a result, ppl reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $90 million deferred income tax benefit during 2015, related to both rate decreases.
(e)   during 2017, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense for the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted by the tcja.
(f)   during 2016, ppl recorded lower income tax expense related to the application of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information.

(a)   primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to ppl's consolidated results. 2017 includes $97 million of additional income tax expense related to the enactment of the tcja. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information. 2015 includes certain costs related to the spinoff of ppl energy supply. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
(b)   as a result of the spinoff of ppl energy supply, substantially representing ppl's former supply segment, the earnings of the supply segment prior to the spinoff are included in discontinued operations. 2015 includes an $879 million charge reflecting the difference between ppl's recorded value for the supply segment and its estimated fair value as of the spinoff date, determined in accordance with the applicable accounting rules under gaap. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
earnings from ongoing operations management utilizes "earnings from ongoing operations" as a non-gaap financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with gaap. ppl believes that earnings from ongoing operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of ppl's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. in addition, ppl's management uses earnings from ongoing operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.
earnings from ongoing operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the effective tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. special items include:
•   unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below).
•   spinoff of the supply segment.
•   gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
46
•   impairment charges.
•   significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.
•   acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.
•   other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.
unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge gbp-denominated anticipated earnings. the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within gaap earnings. management believes that excluding these amounts from earnings from ongoing operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of ppl's underlying hedged earnings. see note 17 to the financial statements and "risk management" below for additional information on foreign currency economic activity.
ppl's earnings from ongoing operations by reportable segment were as follows:

•   see "margins - changes in margins" for an explanation of u.k. gross margins.
•   lower other operation and maintenance expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $67 million from higher pension income due to an increase in expected returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a lower discount rate.
•   lower other operation and maintenance expense in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $86 million from higher pension income due to an increase in expected returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate methodology.
•   higher depreciation expense in 2017 compared with 2016 and 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to additions to pp&amp;e, net of retirements.
•   higher interest expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher interest expense on indexed linked bonds.

•   see "margins - changes in margins" for an explanation of kentucky gross margins.
•   lower other operation and maintenance expense in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to a $29 million reduction of costs as a result of coal units retired in 2015 at the cane run and green river plants, partially offset by $5 million of additional costs for cane run unit 7 plant operations and $12 million of lower pension expense mainly due to higher discount rates and deferred amortization of actuarial losses.
•   higher depreciation expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to additions to pp&amp;e, net of retirements, and higher depreciation rates effective july 1, 2017.
•   higher income taxes in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher pre-tax income at current period tax rates.

•   see "margins - changes in margins" for an explanation of pennsylvania gross margins.
•   lower other operation and maintenance expense for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $17 million of lower bad debt expense, $17 million of lower vegetation management expense and $12 million of lower payroll related expenses, partially offset by $19 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to ppl electric.
•   other operation and maintenance expense for 2016 was comparable with 2015 primarily due to $26 million of lower payroll related expenses, partially offset by $8 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to ppl electric, $8 million of higher costs for additional work done by outside vendors and other costs, which were not individually significant in comparison to the prior year.
•   higher depreciation expense for both periods primarily due to transmission and distribution additions placed into service related to the ongoing efforts to replace aging infrastructure and improve reliability, net of retirements.
•   higher taxes, other than income for 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves in 2015.
•   higher interest expense for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $475 million of 3.950% first mortgage bonds in may 2017.
•   higher income taxes for both periods primarily due to higher pre-tax income at current period tax rates.

margins management also utilizes the following non-gaap financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.
•   "u.k. gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the u.k. regulated segment. in calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from national grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in england and wales, and ofgem license fees (recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed
52
through to customers. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across wpd's distribution network in the u.k. and directly related activities.
•   "kentucky gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the kentucky regulated segment, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as well as the kentucky regulated segment's, lke's and lg&amp;e's distribution and sale of natural gas. in calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from operating revenues. in addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "other operation and maintenance", "depreciation" and "taxes, other than income" on the statements of income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. these mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.
•   "pennsylvania gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the pennsylvania regulated segment and ppl electric. in calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a plr, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "energy purchases," "other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily act 129 and universal service program costs), "depreciation" (which is primarily related to the act 129 smart meter program) and "taxes, other than income," (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the statements of income. this performance measure includes plr energy purchases by ppl electric from ppl energyplus, which are reflected in "energy purchases from affiliate" in the 2015 reconciliation table. as a result of the june 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply and the formation of talen energy, ppl energyplus (renamed talen energy marketing) is no longer an affiliate of ppl electric. ppl electric's purchases from talen energy marketing subsequent to may 31, 2015 are reflected in "energy purchases" in the reconciliation tables. this measure represents the net revenues from the pennsylvania regulated segment's and ppl electric's electricity delivery operations.
these measures are not intended to replace "operating income," which is determined in accordance with gaap, as an indicator of overall operating performance. other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. these performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and ppl's board of directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.
changes in margins the following table shows margins by ppl's reportable segments and by component, as applicable, for the year ended december 31 as well as the changes between periods. the factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table.

u.k. gross margins u.k. gross margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $81 million from the april 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by $30 million from lower volumes and $21 million from the april 1, 2017 price decrease, which includes lower true-up mechanisms partially offset by higher base demand revenue.
u.k. gross margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $166 million from the april 1, 2016 price increase, which included $39 million of the recovery of prior customer rebates, and $21 million of other revenue adjustments in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by $89 million from the april 1, 2015 price decrease resulting from the commencement of riio-ed1 and $36 million from lower volumes.
kentucky gross margins kentucky gross margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher base rates of $58 million ($32 million at lg&e and $26 million at ku) and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $5 million at lg&e, partially offset by $41 million of lower sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017 ($15 million at lg&e and $26 million at ku).
the increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the kpsc effective july 1, 2017. the gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain glt expenses into base rates as a result of the 2016 kentucky rate case. this transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the glt program being excluded from margins in the second half of 2017, while the recovery of such costs remain in kentucky gross margins through base rates.
kentucky gross margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher base rates of $68 million ($4 million at lg&e and $64 million at ku) and returns on additional environmental capital investments of $13 million at lg&e. the increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the kpsc effective july 1, 2015.
pennsylvania gross margins distribution distribution margins decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $10 million of lower electricity sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017, partially offset by $7 million of returns on additional smart meter capital investments.
distribution margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to $121 million of higher base rates, effective january 1, 2016 as a result of the 2015 rate case.
transmission transmission margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase of $51 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability, partially offset by a $17 million decrease as a result of a lower ppl zonal peak load billing factor which affected transmission revenue in the first five months of 2017.
transmission margins increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability.

2018 outlook
(ppl)
higher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017. the increase in net income reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of u.s. tax reform and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. excluding these 2017 special items, the increase is primarily attributable to increases in the u.k. regulated and pennsylvania regulated segments. the following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for ppl's segments and the corporate and other category and the related registrants.

(ppl's u.k. regulated segment)
higher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017. the increase in net income reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of u.s. tax reform and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. excluding these 2017 special items, the increase is expected to be driven primarily by higher assumed gbp exchange rates and higher pension income, partially offset by higher taxes.
(ppl's kentucky regulated segment and lke, lg&e and ku)
higher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of u.s. tax reform.
excluding this 2017 special item, earnings in 2018 compared with 2017 are projected to be lower, driven primarily by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and a lower tax shield on holding company interest and expenses, partially offset by an assumed return to normal weather and higher base electricity and gas rates effective july 1, 2017.
(ppl's pennsylvania regulated segment and ppl electric)
higher net income is projected in 2018 compared with 2017, driven primarily by higher transmission earnings and lower operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense.
(ppl's corporate and other category)
lower costs are projected in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of u.s. tax reform. excluding this 2017 special item, costs are projected to be flat in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a lower tax shield on holding company interest expense offset by lower financing costs.
(all registrants)
earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 1a. risk factors," the rest of this item 7, and notes 1, 6 and 13 to the financial statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

margins
"margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the factors underlying changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, lke's margins are referred to as "kentucky gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income" for the periods ended december 31.

(a)   there are no items management considers special for the periods presented.
earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 increased primarily due to higher base electricity and gas rates effective july 1, 2017, partially offset by lower sales volumes driven by milder weather in 2017 and higher depreciation expense.
earnings in 2016 compared with 2015 increased primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments and lower other operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher interest expense.

margins
"margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful
63
and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, lg&e's margins are included in "kentucky gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income" for the periods ended december 31.

margins
"margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the factors underlying changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, ku's margins are included in "kentucky gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income."

(ppl)
ppl had a $429 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2017 compared with 2016.
•   net income declined $774 million between periods and included net non-cash benefits of $363 million. the increase in net non-cash benefits was primarily due to an increase in unrealized losses on hedging activities, an increase in deferred income taxes (primarily due to the impact of the tcja) and an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements, and higher depreciation rates at lg&amp;e and ku effective july 1, 2017, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency at wpd), partially offset by an increase in the u.k. net periodic defined benefit credits (primarily due to a decrease in the u.k. pension plan discount rates used to calculate the interest cost component of the net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) and increase in expected returns).
•   the $38 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due a decrease in net regulatory assets and liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms), a decrease in fuel, materials and supplies (primarily due to a decrease in fuel purchases due to lower generation driven by milder weather in 2017 compared to 2016) and a decrease in unbilled revenue (primarily due to lower growth in volumes in 2017 compared to 2016), partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable (due to timing of payments), a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due to the timing of payments) and an increase in accounts receivable.
•   defined benefit plan funding was $138 million higher in 2017. the increase was primarily due to the acceleration of wpd's contributions to its u.k. pension plans.
ppl had a $618 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 compared with 2015.
•   net income improved by $299 million between the periods. this included an additional $195 million of net non-cash benefits, including a $132 million increase in deferred income taxes and $96 million of lower unrealized gains on hedging activity (primarily due to the settlement of hedges in the third quarter of 2016) partially offset by a $96 million increase in defined benefit plan income (primarily due to an increase in estimated returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a change in the discount rate for the u.k. pension plans).
•   the $47 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in taxes payable (due to timing of payments) and an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to favorable weather compared to december 2015), an increase in net regulatory assets/liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms) and an increase in accounts receivable (primarily due to increased volumes and favorable weather in 2016).
•   defined benefit plan funding was $72 million lower in 2016.
(ppl electric)
ppl electric had an $8 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016.
•   net income improved by $22 million between the periods. this included an additional $100 million of net non-cash benefits primarily due to a $56 million increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and the replacement of aging infrastructure as well as the roll-out of the act 129 smart meter program, net of retirements) and a $37 million increase in deferred income taxes (primarily due to book versus tax plant timing differences).
•   the $87 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable (primarily due to a 2017 federal income tax benefit refund, not yet received), a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments) and an increase in prepayments (primarily due to an increase in the 2017 gross receipts tax prepayment compared to 2016), partially offset by an decrease in net regulatory assets and liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms) and a decrease in unbilled revenue (primarily due to lower growth in volumes in 2017 compared to 2016).
•   pension funding was $24 million higher in 2017 due to contributions made in 2017 to the ppl retirement plan.
69
ppl electric had an $270 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared with 2015.
•   net income improved by $88 million between the periods. this included an additional $40 million of net non-cash benefits primarily due to a $39 million increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to the replacement of aging infrastructure and to ensure system reliability).
•   the $101 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments), an increase in taxes payable (primarily due to timing of payments) and a decrease in prepayments (primarily due to higher tax payments in 2015), partially offset by an increase in net regulatory assets and liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to higher volumes and favorable weather compared to december 2015) and an increase in accounts receivable.
•   pension funding was $33 million lower in 2016.
(lke)
lke had a $72 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016.

for ppl, in 2017 compared with 2016, higher project expenditures at ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku were partially offset by lower project expenditures at wpd. the increase in project expenditures for ppl electric was primarily due to an increase in capital spending related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure, as well as the roll-out of the act 129 smart meter program. the increase in expenditures for lke, lg&e and ku was primarily due to increased spending for environmental water projects at lg&e's mill creek plant, ccr projects at the trimble county plant and increased spending on various transmission projects at ku, partially offset by lower spending driven by completion of environmental air projects. the decrease in expenditures at wpd was primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by an increase in expenditures to enhance system reliability.

the registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. additionally, subject to market conditions, the registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and ppl electric, lg&e and ku anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2018.
credit facilities the registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in "short-term debt" on the balance sheets except for borrowings under lg&e's term loan agreement which are reflected in "long-term debt" on the balance sheets. at december 31, 2017, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the borrowings under these facilities were:

(a)   the syndicated credit facilities, as well as ku's letter of credit facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for ppl capital funding, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.
the commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: ppl - 10%, ppl electric 7%, lke - 18%, lg&e - 33% and ku - 37%.
(b)   each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does lg&amp;e under its term loan agreement and ku under its letter of credit facility. borrowings generally bear interest at libor-based rates plus an applicable margin.
(c)   the facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its rav, calculated in accordance with the credit facility.
the amounts borrowed at december 31, 2017, include a usd-denominated borrowing of $200 million and gbp-denominated borrowings of £300 million, which equated to $406 million. the unused capacity reflects the usd-denominated amount borrowed in gbp of £150 million as of the date borrowed. at december 31, 2017, the usd equivalent of unused capacity under the u.k. committed credit facilities was $819 million.
the commitments under the u.k.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 20% of the total committed capacity.
74
in addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. the registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. at december 31, 2017, the registrants were in compliance with these covenants. at this time, the registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

dividends/distributions
(ppl)
ppl views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. in november 2017, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable january 2, 2018, at 39.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.58 per annum). on february 22, 2018, ppl announced that the company is increasing its common stock dividend to 41.0 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to 1.64 per annum). future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors.
see note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the june 1, 2015 distribution to ppl's shareowners of a newly formed entity, holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy.
subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 or 2013 series b junior subordinated notes due 2073. at december 31, 2017, no interest payments were deferred.
(ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku)
from time to time, as determined by their respective board of directors, the registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. certain of the credit facilities of ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.
(all registrants)
see note 7 to the financial statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the registrants and their subsidiaries.
purchase or redemption of debt securities the registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. the amounts involved may be material.
rating agency actions moody's and s&p periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the registrants and their subsidiaries. based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the registrants and other sources. the ratings of moody's and s&p are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the registrants or their subsidiaries. such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.
the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. a downgrade in the registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. the registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.
the following table sets forth the registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2017.

ratings triggers
(ppl)
as discussed in note 7 to the financial statements, certain of wpd's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (moody's or s&p) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of ba1 or bb+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. a restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which wpd (east midlands), wpd (south west), wpd (south wales) and wpd (west midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. these notes totaled £4.7 billion (approximately $6.4 billion) nominal value at december 31, 2017.
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for ppl), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if ppl's, lke's, lg&e's or ku's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. see note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of "credit risk-related contingent features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for ppl, lke and lg&e for derivative contracts in a net liability position at december 31, 2017.
guarantees for subsidiaries (ppl)
ppl guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. at this
81
time, ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information about guarantees.
off-balance sheet arrangements (all registrants)
the registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of these agreements.
risk management market risk
(all registrants)
see notes 1, 16, and 17 to the financial statements for information about the registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.
the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.
interest rate risk the registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. the registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. in addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.
the following interest rate hedges were outstanding at december 31.

foreign currency risk (ppl)
ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in u.k. affiliates. under its risk management program, ppl may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.
the following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at december 31.

commodity price risk ppl is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.
•   ppl electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a plr. potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its puc-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its plr customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.
•   lg&amp;e's and ku's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. in addition, lg&amp;e's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. these mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.
volumetric risk ppl is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•   wpd is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the u.k. under the riio-ed1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information on revenue recognition under riio-ed1.
•   ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.

credit risk
(all registrants)
credit risk is the risk that the registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. the registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. however, the registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. these concentrations may impact the registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.
(ppl and ppl electric)
in january 2017, the puc issued a final order approving ppl electric's plr procurement plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply semi-annually in april and october. to date, ppl electric has conducted two of its planned eight competitive solicitations.
under the standard supply master agreement (the agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, ppl electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. in the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, ppl electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. all incremental costs incurred by ppl electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. at december 31, 2017, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from s&p, and were not required to post collateral under the agreement. a small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the agreement. there is no instance under the agreement in which ppl electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.
see note 17 to the financial statements for additional information on credit risk.
foreign currency translation (ppl)
the value of the british pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the u.s. dollar. in 2017, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $537 million, which primarily reflected a $935 million increase to pp&e and $198 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $549 million increase to long-term debt and an increase of $47 million to other net liabilities. in 2016, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $1.1 billion, which primarily reflected a $2.1 billion decrease to pp&e and $490 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $208 million to other net liabilities. in 2015, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $240 million, which primarily reflected a $472 million decrease to pp&e and $117 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $285 million decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $64 million to other net liabilities.

environmental matters extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to ppl's, ppl electric's, lke's, lg&e's and ku's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the registrants' businesses. the cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. in addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the registrants' services. increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.
see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including: legal matters, naaqs, climate change, ccrs, and elgs. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2018 through 2022. see note 19 to the financial statements for information related to the impacts of ccrs on aros.
sustainability increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of "sustainability", which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. these parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. as a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. those efforts remain ongoing. in addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the sec promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "'34 act"), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 act reports. to date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the sec.
as has been ppl's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the registrants' financial condition or results of operation, ppl discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and sec regulations. with respect to other sustainability topics that ppl deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and sec regulation, ppl will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this form 10-k by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this form 10-k. in preparing its sustainability report, ppl is guided by the framework established by the global reporting initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories, together with recent efforts by the edison electric institute to provide guidance as to the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry.

new accounting guidance see note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance pending adoption.
application of critical accounting policies financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. the following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in note 1 to the financial statements). senior management has reviewed with ppl's audit committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.
defined benefits
(all registrants)
certain of the registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. these plans are applicable to the majority of the registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). the registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to aoci or, in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the balance sheets. see notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.
a summary of plan sponsors by registrant and whether a registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (s) or participate in and receives allocations (p) from those plans is shown in the table below.

(a)   does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans.
management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. as such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets based on estimated results. any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in aoci, or in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. these amounts in aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. the delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. the primary assumptions are:
•   discount rate - the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
•   expected return on plan assets - management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over the life of the plan. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the registrants record currently.
86
•   rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.
•   health care cost trend rate - management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.
in addition to the economic assumptions above that are evaluated annually, management must also make assumptions regarding the life expectancy of employees covered under their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
•   u.s. - at december 31, 2014, the plan sponsors adopted the mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries in october 2014 (rp-2014 base tables) for all u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. in addition, at december 31, 2017, the plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the mp-2017 improvement scale for all u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. this new mortality assumption reflects the expectation of lower ongoing improvements in life expectancies.
•   u.k. - at march 31 2016, the u.k. plan sponsors adopted the new mortality assumptions based on the "saps s2 all" tables issued by the self-administered pensions schemes' (saps) study for all u.k. defined benefit pension plans. in addition, the u.k. plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the cmi 2015 core projections model published by the continuous mortality investigation study with a long-term future improvement rate of 1% for all u.k. defined benefit pension plans. these new mortality assumptions reflect the impact of the most recently available actual scheme mortality data (which has been higher than previously expected) on both current life expectancies and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies. the use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in a decrease to u.k. defined benefit pension obligations, a decrease to future expense and an increase to funded status.
(ppl)
in selecting the discount rate for its u.k. pension plans, wpd starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. these plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. the spot-rate yield curve uses an iboxx british pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. from this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. historically, wpd used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates used to discount the benefit obligation. concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at december 31, 2015, wpd began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost.
an individual bond matching approach, which is used for the u.s. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the u.k. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the u.k. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach.
(all registrants)
in selecting the discount rates for u.s. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. the plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. this bond matching process begins with the full universe of aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.
to determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.
in selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.
the following table provides the weighted-average assumptions selected for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at december 31 used to measure current year obligations and subsequent year net periodic defined benefit costs under gaap, as applicable.

(a)   wpd began using individual spot rates from the yield curve used to discount the benefit obligation to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost in 2016. ppl's u.s. plans use a single discount rate derived from an individual bond matching model to measure the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional details.
in selecting health care cost trend rates, plan sponsors consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs. at december 31, 2017, the health care cost trend rate for all plans was 6.6% for 2018, gradually declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% in 2022.
a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2017, the defined benefit plans were recorded in the registrants' financial statements as follows.

income taxes (all registrants)
the registrants have completed or made reasonable estimates of the effects of the tcja and reflected these amounts in their december 31, 2017 financial statements. the registrants continue to evaluate the application of the tcja and have used significant management judgment to make certain assumptions concerning the application of various components of the law in the calculation of 2017 income tax expense. the current and deferred components of the income tax expense calculations that the registrants consider provisional due to uncertainty either with respect to the technical application of the law or the quantification of the impact of the law include (but are not limited to): tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, and the accumulated foreign earnings used to calculate the deemed dividend included in ppl's taxable income in 2017 along with the impact of associated foreign tax credits and related valuation allowances. the registrants believe that classification of these items as provisional is appropriate. the registrants have accounted for these items based on their interpretation of the tcja.
89
further interpretive guidance on the tcja from the irs, treasury, the joint committee on taxation through its "blue book" or from congress in the form of technical corrections may differ from the registrants' interpretation of the tcja.
significant management judgment is also required in developing the registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested.
significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. the first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. this determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. the second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. the benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.
on a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.
at december 31, 2017, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.
the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
see note 5 to the financial statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the tcja and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested. based on this conclusion, ppl global does not record u.s. federal income taxes on wpd's undistributed earnings.
regulatory assets and liabilities
(all registrants)
ppl electric, lg&e and ku, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. as a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under gaap for non-regulated entities. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. if future recovery of costs
90
ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.
see note 6 to the financial statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at december 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. all regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.
(ppl)
wpd operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by ofgem. as the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation. therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is primarily evaluated based on revenue recognition guidance. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information.
price risk management (ppl)
see "financial condition - risk management" above, as well as "price risk management" in note 1 to the financial statements.
goodwill impairment (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. ppl has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments. lke, lg&e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. a goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.
ppl, lke, lg&e and ku may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. if the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.
when the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, ppl, lke, lg&e and ku determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. that is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.
ppl's goodwill was $3.3 billion at december 31, 2017, which consists of $2.6 billion related to the acquisition of wpd and $662 million related to the acquisition of lke. ppl (for its u.k. regulated and kentucky regulated segments), and individually, lke, lg&e and ku elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill, as of october 1, 2017. these evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:
•   current year financial performance versus the prior year;
•   changes in planned capital expenditures;
91
•   the consistency of forecasted free cash flows;
•   earnings quality and sustainability;
•   changes in market participant discount rates;
•   changes in long-term growth rates;
•   changes in ppl's market capitalization; and
•   the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.
based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. as such, the two-step quantitative impairment test was not performed.
asset retirement obligations (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
aro liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. the initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. an aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated. an equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. for lke, lg&e and ku, all aro accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. aro regulatory assets associated with certain ccr projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. for other aros, at the time of retirement, the related aro regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, pp&e and aro liability.
see note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on aros.
in determining aros, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the aro was incurred. changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the aro. any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.
at december 31, 2017, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded aros were as follows.

revenue recognition - unbilled revenues (lke, lg&e and ku)
revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. for lg&e and ku, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. the unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of
92
weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. see "unbilled revenues" on the registrants' balance sheets for balances at december 31, 2017 and 2016.

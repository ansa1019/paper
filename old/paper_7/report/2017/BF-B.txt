item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader better understand brown-forman, our operations, our financial results, and our current business environment. please read the md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." all per share amounts have been adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split that occurred in august 2016. see note 11 to the accompanying financial statements for details. our md&a is organized as follows:
table of contents page presentation basis. this md&amp;a reflects the basis of presentation described in note 1 "accounting policies". in addition, we define statistical and non-gaap financial measures that we believe help readers understand our results of operations and the trends affecting our business.                                                                  25
significant developments. we discuss developments during the most recent three fiscal years. please read this section in conjunction with "item 1. business", which provides a general description of our business and strategy.                                                                                                                             26
executive summary. we discuss (a) fiscal 2017 highlights and (b) our outlook for fiscal 2018, including the trends, developments, and uncertainties that we expect to affect our business.                                                                                                                                                                   28
results of operations. we discuss (a) fiscal 2017 results for our largest markets, (b) fiscal 2017 results for our largest brands, and (c) the causes of year-over-year changes in our income statement line items, including transactions and other items that affect the comparability of our results, for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.                     31
liquidity and capital resources. we discuss (a) the causes of year-over-year changes in cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities; (b) recent and expected future capital expenditures; (c) dividends and share repurchases; and (d) our liquidity position, including capital resources available to us.         41
off-balance sheet arrangements and long-term obligations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    43
critical accounting policies and estimates. we discuss the critical accounting policies and estimates that require significant management judgment.                                                                                                                                                                                                          44
presentation basis volume and depletions when discussing volume, unless otherwise specified, we refer to "depletions," a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry. depending on the context, "depletions" means either (a) our shipments directly to retailers or wholesalers, or (b) shipments from our distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. we generally record revenues when we ship our products to our customers, so our reported sales for a period do not necessarily reflect actual consumer purchases during that period. we believe that our depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to distributor customers do.
volume is discussed on a nine-liter equivalent unit basis (nine-liter cases) unless otherwise specified. at times, we use a "drinks-equivalent" measure for volume when comparing single-serve ready-to-drink (rtd) or ready-to-pour (rtp) brands to a parent spirits brand. "drinks-equivalent" depletions are rtd and rtp nine-liter cases converted to nine-liter cases of a parent brand on the basis of the number of drinks in one nine-liter case of the parent brand. to convert rtd volumes from a nine-liter case basis to a drinks-equivalent nine-liter case basis, rtd nine-liter case volumes are divided by 10, while rtp nine-liter case volumes are divided by 5.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under gaap. these non-gaap measures, defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under gaap. the non-gaap measures we use in this report may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
"underlying change" in income statement measures. we present changes in certain income statement measures, or line items, that are adjusted to an "underlying" basis. we use "underlying change" for the following income statement measures: (a) underlying net sales, (b) underlying cost of sales, (c) underlying gross profit, (d) underlying advertising expenses, (e) underlying selling, general, and administrative (sg&a) expenses, and (f) underlying operating income. to calculate these measures, we adjust, as
25
applicable, for (a) acquisition and divestiture activity, (b) foreign exchange, and (c) estimated net changes in distributor inventories. we explain these adjustments below.
•   "acquisitions and divestitures." in fiscal 2016, we sold our southern comfort and tuaca brands and related assets to sazerac company, inc. in fiscal 2017, we acquired the benriach distillery company limited (benriach). see discussion below and notes 16 and 17 in the accompanying financial statements for details. this adjustment removes (a) transaction-related costs for the acquisition and divestiture, (b) the gain on the sale of southern comfort and tuaca, and (c) operating activity for the acquisition and divestiture for the non-comparable periods. with respect to comparisons of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015, the non-comparable period comprised march and april; with respect to comparisons of fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016, the non-comparable period comprised all months. we believe that these adjustments allow us to understand better our underlying results on a comparable basis.
•   "foreign exchange." we calculate the percentage change in our income statement line items in accordance with gaap and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant-dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the underlying trend both positively and negatively. (in this report, "dollar" always means the u.s. dollar unless stated otherwise.) to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current year results at prior-year rates.
•   "estimated net change in distributor inventories." this adjustment refers to the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on changes in our income statement line items. for each period compared, we use depletion information provided by our distributors to estimate the effect of distributor inventory changes on our income statement line items. we believe that adjusting for the effect of varying levels of distributor inventories on changes in our income statement line items allows us to understand better underlying results and trends.
we use the non-gaap measures "underlying change" for the following reasons: (a) to understand our performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to compare our performance to that of our competitors; (b) in connection with management incentive compensation calculations; (c) in our planning and forecasting processes; and (d) in communications concerning our financial performance with the board of directors, stockholders, and investment analysts. we provide reconciliations of the "underlying changes in income statement measures" to their nearest gaap measures in the tables below under "results of operations - year-over-year comparisons." we have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-gaap measure.
"return on average invested capital." this measure refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt, and is calculated using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. after-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. we use this non-gaap measure because we consider return on average invested capital to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we use capital invested in our business.
"adjusted" measures for (a) operating income, (b) operating margin, (c) effective tax rate, (d) diluted earnings per share, and (e) return on average invested capital. these measures remove the effects of (a) the gain on the sale of southern comfort and tuaca, (b) those transaction-related costs not included in the gain on sale of southern comfort and tuaca, (c) financing-related costs for the acquisition of benriach, and (d) operating activity for the acquired and divested businesses in the non-comparable periods. with respect to the comparison of fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016, the non-comparable period comprised all months of both years. tax effects on relevant adjustments are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. we provide these adjusted measures to identify the effect of the sale of southern comfort and tuaca and the acquisition of benriach on reported income from operations and other key measures derived therefrom; adjusting for these effects allows us to analyze results and trends on a comparable basis.
we reconcile each of these measures to their nearest gaap measures in the table below under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive summary." we have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-gaap measure.
significant developments below we discuss the significant developments in our business during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2017. these developments relate to (a) innovation, (b) acquisitions and divestitures, and (c) capital deployment.
innovation
•   jack daniel's family of brands. following the successful launch and subsequent global rollout of jack daniel's tennessee honey (jdth) starting in fiscal 2011, we introduced a second flavored whiskey product, jack daniel's tennessee fire (jdtf),
26
starting with the united states in late fiscal 2015. in fiscal 2016, we completed the u.s. launch and continued the global rollout of jdtf. in fiscal 2017, we expanded jdtf to markets including france, germany, and travel retail. the chart below shows the volume development of jdtf from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017.
•   other american whiskeys. we continue to capitalize on consumers' interest in high-quality, super- and ultra-premium whiskey with our range of brands including woodford reserve and old forester.
◦   in fiscal 2015, we launched woodford reserve rye whiskey. in fiscal 2017, we unveiled new packaging for woodford reserve double oaked, the most successful line extension from woodford reserve to date (first introduced in 2012). the rye and double oaked variants of woodford reserve continued to contribute meaningfully to the brand's growth and collectively surpassed 50 thousand nine-liter cases in fiscal 2017.
◦   in february 2017, we launched new packaging for our oldest brand, old forester. we continued to invest in the renaissance of our founding brand, which grew net sales by more than 39% on a compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017.
◦   also in fiscal 2017, we introduced our first entirely new bourbon in 20 years, coopers' craft, a super-premium brand now in limited distribution in the united states.
•   tequila brands. we experienced another record year for our tequila brands in fiscal 2017, as herradura, el jimador, and new mix contributed significantly to our overall net sales growth. in fiscal 2015, we released herradura ultra to participate in the fast-growing market for ultra-premium "cristalino" tequilas in mexico. herradura ultra reached nearly 50 thousand nine-liter cases in fiscal 2017 and has been a driver of our tequila growth during the last three fiscal years.
acquisitions and divestitures
•   in june 2015, we purchased all of the shares of slane castle irish whiskey limited and announced plans to introduce new irish whiskeys using high-quality whiskey purchased from other irish distillers and triple-cask finished to slane's specifications while the whiskey made at the new slane distillery matures. in april 2017, we unveiled the first product from our slane irish whiskey brand in travel retail in ireland, and we expect to introduce the brand in the united states, the united kingdom, and australia during the summer of 2017.
•   in march 2016, we sold our southern comfort and tuaca brands and related assets to sazerac company, inc. for $543 million in cash, which resulted in a gain of $485 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. we substantially completed all activities related to this transition of ownership in fiscal 2017. see ''executive summary'' below and note 16 to the accompanying financial statements for details about the financial impact of the sale of southern comfort and tuaca.
•   on june 1, 2016, we acquired the benriach distillery company limited (benriach) for aggregate consideration of $407 million, consisting of a purchase price of $341 million and $66 million in assumed debt and transaction-related obligations that we have since paid. the acquisition, which brought three single malt scotch whisky brands into our portfolio, included brand trademarks, inventories, three malt distilleries, a bottling plant, and benriach's headquarters in edinburgh, scotland. we believe that these super-premium brands will provide us an opportunity to participate in the growing single malt scotch category and strengthen our portfolio's long-term growth prospects in the united states, the united kingdom, taiwan, germany, and travel retail. see note 17 to the accompanying financial statements for details.
27
capital deployment beyond the acquisition and divestiture activities described above, our capital deployment initiatives have been focused on (1) enabling the expected future growth of our existing businesses through investments in our production capacity, barrel whiskey inventory, and brand-building efforts for our existing portfolio; and (2) returning cash to our shareholders.
investments. from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, our capital expenditures totaled $340 million and were focused on enabling the growth of our premium whiskey brands as further detailed below.
◦   jack daniel's. we expanded our distilling capacity and constructed three new warehouses, and we continued work on the expansion of our shipping warehouse facility.
◦   woodford reserve. we expanded our bottling facility and constructed five new warehouses. we also continued construction of an additional warehouse.
◦   old forester. we continued construction of the old forester distillery and visitors' center on main street in louisville, kentucky, which is expected to open in the spring of 2018.
◦   slane irish whiskey. we continued building a new distillery and consumer experience on the historic slane castle estate, which is expected to open in the summer of 2017.
•   debt and equity transactions. from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, we returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders through $0.8 billion in regular quarterly dividends and $2.1 billion in share repurchases. we issued long-term debt totaling $1.2 billion (net), including (a) the $500 million 4.5% 30-year notes in june 2015 and (b) two foreign currency denominated bonds, the €300 million 1.2% 10-year notes and the £300 million 2.6% 12-year notes, in june 2016.
executive summary fiscal 2017 highlights key highlights of our operating results in fiscal 2017 include:
•   we delivered net sales of $3.0 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to fiscal 2016. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales were flat. after additionally adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange and the estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, we grew underlying net sales 3%.
•   we delivered operating income of $1.0 billion, a decrease of 35% compared to fiscal 2016. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operating income was flat. after additionally adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange and the estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, we grew underlying operating income 7%.
•   we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.71, a decrease of 34% compared to fiscal 2016. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5%.
•   our return on average invested capital declined to 19.3% in fiscal 2017, compared to 34.1% in fiscal 2016. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted average return on invested capital declined to 21.3% in fiscal 2017 from 22.1% in fiscal 2016.
our underlying operating results were primarily driven by the performance of the jack daniel's family of brands, our tequila brands, and woodford reserve, partially offset by declines in used barrel sales. from a geographic perspective, the united states and our developed international markets led the growth; emerging markets growth accelerated compared to fiscal 2016; and our business in travel retail returned to growth in fiscal 2017 following declines in fiscal 2016. in addition, our underlying operating results benefited from the reduction of underlying sg&a expenses.
foreign exchange negatively affected our reported operating results, driven by the dollar's strengthening against a number of currencies, including, the mexican peso, euro, and british pound. an estimated net reduction in distributor inventories due primarily to the united states and russia also negatively affected our reported results.

fiscal 2018 outlook we are optimistic about our prospects for growth of net sales, operating income, and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018. below we discuss our current expectations for fiscal 2018, including trends, developments, and uncertainties that we expect to affect our business.
outlook for key measures:
•   net sales. we expect the jack daniel's family of brands, our portfolio of premium bourbons, and our tequila brands to drive our net sales growth. we expect that volume will be the most significant driver of net sales growth in fiscal 2018.
additionally, we expect that recent and new additions to our portfolio will contribute to our net sales growth; these include: (a) the fall 2017 introduction of jack daniel's tennessee rye in the united states, (b) the expansion of our scotch whiskey brands following their successful integration in fiscal 2017, and (c) the rollout of slane irish whiskey.
•   operating expenses. we expect total operating expenses to grow at a slower rate than net sales. in addition, we expect: (a) for cost of sales, input costs should increase in the low single digits, (b) advertising expenses to grow at a rate similar to our net sales growth rate, and (c) sg&amp;a expenses to be approximately unchanged compared to fiscal 2017.
additional considerations related to our fiscal 2018 outlook:
•   sale of southern comfort and tuaca. in fiscal 2016, we sold our southern comfort and tuaca brands and related assets. our fiscal 2017 results compared to fiscal 2016 were negatively affected by this sale. looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we do not expect our growth rates compared to the prior fiscal year period to be affected by the divestiture. see discussion above and note 16 to the accompanying financial statements for details about the financial impact of the sale of southern comfort and tuaca.
•   productivity and efficiency initiative. in june 2017, we announced a multiyear cost saving and productivity initiative designed to (a) deliver sustainable cost savings, and (b) accelerate our net sales growth rate, as a portion of the cost savings generated by the initiative are expected to be invested in incremental advertising and promotional activities. our fiscal 2018 outlook reflects the currently expected effects of this initiative.
•   foreign exchange. in fiscal 2017, our reported results were significantly affected by negative foreign exchange due to the strength of the u.s. dollar; however, we anticipate our fiscal 2018 results will not be as negatively affected. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for more information about foreign exchange and our business.
•   global whiskey trends and competition. we expect that the continued success of our existing premium-plus whiskeys, as well as the introduction and expansion of our new whiskeys, will drive our net sales growth in fiscal 2018. the american, irish, and single malt scotch whiskey categories are growing faster than total distilled spirits globally,1 but competition has intensified as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumers' interest in these categories. while we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends, we may also be negatively affected by the increased competition.

2"remaining geographies" represents over 110 countries, with the largest being brazil, south africa, and chile.
3"travel retail" represents our sales to global duty free customers, travel retail customers, and the u.s. military.
4"other non-branded" includes used barrel, bulk whiskey and wine, and contract bottling sales.
the united states, our largest and most important market, accounted for 48% of our reported net sales in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, reported net sales in the united states fell 3%, while underlying net sales increased 4%, after adjusting for the absence of revenues associated with southern comfort and tuaca (which were sold last march) and an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories. underlying net sales gains were driven primarily by (a) our american whiskey portfolio, led by jdtw, woodford reserve, old forester, and gentleman jack; (b) our tequila brands, led by el jimador and herradura; (c) sonoma-cutrer; and (d) korbel champagne. this growth was partially offset by declines of canadian mist.
europe accounted for 26% of our reported net sales in fiscal 2017, down from 27% in fiscal 2016. for fiscal 2017, reported net sales in europe were down 8%, while underlying net sales grew 4%, after adjusting for (a) the net effect of acquired and divested brands, (b) the negative effect of foreign exchange driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the euro, british pound, and turkish lira, and (c) an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories primarily in russia. the growth in underlying net sales was driven by gains in france, the united kingdom, germany, poland, ukraine, and russia, partially offset by declines in belgium and turkey.
•   in the united kingdom, underlying net sales growth was driven by higher volumes of jdtw, jack daniel's ready-to-drinks (jd rtds), and chambord as well as higher prices and favorable customer mix of jdtw.
31
•   in germany, underlying net sales growth was driven by higher volumes of jd rtds and jdth, and the introduction of jdtf. jdtw volumes declined driven by customer buying patterns, although consumer takeaway trends remained solid.
•   in france, underlying net sales growth was primarily driven by higher volumes for jdtw and the introduction of jdtf, as the jack daniel's family of brands continued to gain market share in the world's fourth largest whiskey market.
•   in poland, higher volumes of jdtw led underlying net sales growth, partially offset by a decline in volume of finlandia.
•   in russia, underlying net sales growth was driven by price increases on finlandia and jdtw intended to mitigate the effect of the devaluation of the ruble, partially offset by volume declines of both brands. after a period of declines driven by the challenging economic environment, russia returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2017, driven by jdtw and finlandia, as the market began to stabilize.
australia accounted for 5% of our reported net sales in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, reported net sales were down 2%, but underlying net sales were up 2% after adjusting for the negative effect of the absence of revenues resulting from the sale of southern comfort and tuaca and the positive effect of foreign exchange. underlying net sales growth was driven by the jack daniel's family of brands, led by recently launched jd rtd products, which were partially offset by declines of jack daniel's & cola.
net sales for our other geographies constituted 14% of our reported net sales in fiscal 2017, up from 13% in fiscal 2016. reported net sales increased 1% in fiscal 2017 and underlying net sales were up 4% after adjusting reported results for the negative effect of foreign exchange driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the mexican peso and the estimated net increase in distributor inventories in japan. underlying net sales growth was led by mexico and japan, the latter of which benefited from price increases in fiscal 2017. these gains were partially offset by declines in southeast asia, china, and sub-saharan africa.
travel retail accounted for 4% of our reported net sales in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. reported net sales increased 3% and underlying net sales increased 7% after adjusting reported results for the absence of revenues resulting from the sale of southern comfort and tuaca and the negative effect of foreign exchange. following declines in fiscal 2016, underlying net sales growth was led by higher volumes of jdtw and jdth, distribution gains on woodford reserve, and the expansion of jdtf into europe.
other non-branded. reported net sales increased 11%, while underlying net sales declined 18% after removing the net effect of acquired and divested businesses (primarily bulk whiskey and contract bottling sales). the reduction in underlying net sales was due primarily to declines in used barrel sales largely reflecting lower prices due to increased supply of used barrels and somewhat weaker demand from blended scotch industry buyers.

in fiscal 2017, the jack daniel's family of brands grew volumes 3% globally to 16.1 million drinks-equivalent nine-liter cases across all expressions of the brand. reported net sales for the family were flat, while underlying net sales increased 3% after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange primarily due to the strengthening of the dollar against the british pound, euro, mexican peso, and turkish lira. jack daniel's family of brands was the most significant contributor to our total underlying net sales growth in fiscal 2017. the following are details about the underlying performance of the jack daniel's family of brands:
33
jack daniel's tennessee whiskey generates a significant percentage of our total net sales, and it is our top priority. as the world's fourth-largest premium spirits brand measured by both volume and retail value,1 jdtw is one of the most valuable spirits brands in the world. during calendar 2016, jdtw grew volume for the 25th consecutive year and, among the top five premium spirits brands on the list, jack daniel's tennessee whiskey was the only one to grow by volume in 20161 - an achievement that underscores our belief in the brand's sustainable appeal and long-term growth potential. jdtw grew volumes 1% globally in fiscal 2017, down from its 3% growth rate in fiscal 2016. jdtw reported net sales declined 1%, while underlying net sales grew 3% led by the united states, poland, france, the united kingdom, japan, mexico, and travel retail. these increases were partially offset by declines in belgium, southeast asia, sub-saharan africa, china, and turkey.
since its introduction in late fiscal 2011, jack daniel's tennessee honey has contributed significantly to our net sales growth. jdth is now the 12th largest brand in the world priced over $25 per 750ml bottle.2 in fiscal 2017, jdth grew volumes by 6%, on top of the 8% growth rate last fiscal year. jdth grew reported net sales 3% and underlying net sales 4% driven by higher volumes in the united states, travel retail, and germany. these gains were partially offset by declines in brazil.
our other jack daniel's whiskey brands reported net sales grew 3% and underlying net sales increased 5%. the most significant contributor to underlying net sales growth was jdtf, which was led by the expansion in france, germany, and travel retail. in the united states, jdtf full-year results declined as volumes in the first half of last year were high due to the national introduction in late fiscal 2015, but the brand returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2017. gentleman jack also contributed to underlying net sales growth, while jack daniel's sinatra declined.
the jack daniel's rtds/rtps brands grew volume 8%, reported net sales 3%, and underlying net sales 6% in fiscal 2017. jd rtds' underlying net sales growth was driven by consumer-led volumetric gains, distribution expansion, and product innovation in mexico, germany, the united kingdom, and australia.
in fiscal 2017, new mix volumes increased 7%. reported net sales increased 2%, while underlying net sales grew 17% after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the dollar against the mexican peso. the growth in underlying net sales was driven by higher prices and volume gains.
finlandia volumes were flat in fiscal 2017, while reported net sales were down 10% and underlying net sales declined 1% after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange and an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories. the decline in underlying net sales was driven predominantly by lower volumes in poland, the brand's largest market, and in the united states. these declines were partially offset by volume gains in travel retail.
canadian mist volumes declined 7%, while reported net sales decreased 13% and underlying net sales declined 12% in fiscal 2017. the net sales declines were driven by volume declines and lower prices in the united states, which is the brand's largest market.
el jimador volumes grew 4% in fiscal 2017. reported net sales were flat, while underlying net sales were up 8% after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the dollar against the mexican peso. underlying net sales growth was driven by higher volumes in the united states, where el jimador remained on the impact's "hot brands" list3 in calendar 2016.
woodford reserve grew volumes 18% in fiscal 2017 (after growing 26% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015) and was once again selected as an impact's "hot brand."3 in addition, reported net sales increased 14% and underlying net sales grew 19% in fiscal 2017. the united states is by far the brand's most important market and was responsible for most of its growth during fiscal 2017. woodford reserve continued its momentum outside the united states as well, growing volumes 23%, driven by distribution expansion in travel retail. during fiscal 2017, we increased our advertising investment behind woodford reserve both in the united states and internationally. woodford reserve led a fast-growing competitive set of super-premium american whiskeys, and we believe it is poised for continued growth as interest in bourbon increases around the world. we plan to devote substantial resources to woodford reserve to support its growth potential, including sustained advertising investment focused on consumer communications and capital spending.

34
in fiscal 2017, herradura volumes grew 12%. reported net sales increased 9% and underlying net sales were up 14% after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the dollar against the mexican peso. this growth was driven primarily by increased volumes in the brand's largest markets, mexico and the united states, as well as higher prices in mexico. both of these markets benefited from consumer-led volumetric growth of herradura ultra, our "cristalino" tequila expression released in fiscal 2015. we remain focused on developing herradura in the united states (where we continue to see considerable potential for growth), strengthening our position in mexico, and continuing to build our presence in higher-value tequila markets throughout the world.

net sales of $2,994 million decreased 3%, or $95 million, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting reported results for (a) the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, (b) the negative effect of foreign exchange, and (c) the estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, underlying net sales grew 3%. the negative effect of foreign exchange was driven primarily by the dollar's strengthening against the mexican peso, euro, and british pound. the change in underlying net sales was driven almost equally by the positive impact of price/mix and volume growth. volume growth was led by the jack daniel's family and the tequilas, partially offset by declines in canadian mist. improved price/mix was driven by (a) higher average pricing on jdtw and the tequilas, and (b) a shift in sales out of lower-priced brands (most notably, canadian mist) to higher priced brands (most notably, jack daniel's family and woodford reserve; the gains were partially offset by declines in used barrel sales.
the primary factors contributing to underlying net sales growth were:
•   our american whiskey portfolio in the united states, led by jdtw, woodford reserve, old forester, and gentleman jack;
•   jdtw in several international markets, most notably, poland, france, the united kingdom, japan, mexico, and travel retail;
•   our tequila brands, led by (1) higher prices and volume gains of new mix in mexico, (2) higher volumes of herradura and el jimador in the united states, and (3) higher volumes and price increases of herradura in mexico;
•   jd rtds, partially due to new product introductions, led by mexico, germany, the united kingdom, and australia;
•   sonoma-cutrer and korbel champagne in the united states;
•   jdtf driven by launches in germany, france, and travel retail; and
•   woodford reserve outside of the united states, driven by distribution expansion in travel retail.
the primary factors partially offsetting growth in underlying net sales were declines of:
•   used barrel sales, reflecting lower prices due to increased supply of used barrels and somewhat weaker demand from blended scotch industry buyers;
•   jdtw in belgium, southeast asia, sub-saharan africa, china, and turkey;
•   canadian mist volumes in the united states; and
•   lower-margin agency brands that we no longer distribute.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net sales of $3,089 million decreased 1%, or $45 million, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. underlying net sales growth was 5%, after adjusting reported results for the negative effects of foreign exchange and the sale of southern comfort and tuaca. the negative effect of foreign exchange was driven primarily by the dollar's broad strengthening against most currencies. the change in underlying net sales was driven by the 4% positive impact of price/mix and 1% volume growth. improved price/mix was driven by a shift in sales out of lower-priced brands, most notably finlandia and canadian mist, to higher-priced brands, led by the jack daniel's family and woodford reserve.

the primary factors contributing to underlying net sales growth were:
•   our american whiskey portfolio in the united states, led by jdtw, woodford reserve, gentleman jack, and old forester;
•   jdtw volumes in several international markets, led by the united kingdom, france, germany, and mexico; and beneficial channel mix in turkey;
•   jdtf, due to its launch in the united states and the united kingdom;
•   our tequila brands, led by (1) higher volumes of new mix in mexico, (2) higher prices and volumes of herradura in the united states and mexico, and (3) higher volumes of el jimador in the united states;
•   korbel champagne and sonoma-cutrer in the united states;
•   jdth outside the united states, led by brazil and france; and
•   used barrel sales driven by higher prices.
the primary factors partially offsetting growth in underlying net sales were declines of:
•   jdtw volumes in travel retail and russia;
•   lower-margin brands that we discontinued in fiscal 2016 and lower-margin agency brands that we no longer distribute;
•   southern comfort in the united states before the sale;
•   canadian mist in the united states;
•   finlandia in europe, most notably in russia; and
•   volume of el jimador in mexico.

note: totals may differ due to rounding fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
cost of sales of $973 million increased $28 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. underlying cost of sales grew 4% after adjusting reported costs for the estimated net change in distributor inventories. the increase in underlying costs of sales was driven by growth in sales volumes and higher input costs, including wood and grain. looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we currently expect that input costs will increase in the low single digits.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cost of sales of $945 million decreased $6 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. underlying cost of sales grew 3% after adjusting reported costs for the positive effect of foreign exchange. about one-third of the underlying increase in costs of sales was driven by growth in sales volumes, while the other two-thirds related to higher input costs, including wood and grain, and a shift in product mix to higher-cost brands.

gross margin decreased to 69.4% in fiscal 2016, down 30 basis points from 69.7% in fiscal 2015. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the negative effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher pricing and favorable mix shift.

advertising expenses of $383 million decreased $34 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. underlying advertising expenses increased 2% after adjusting reported results for the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the benefit of foreign exchange. the increase in underlying advertising expense was driven by higher spending on (a) jdtw, due in part to the 150th anniversary of jack daniel's distillery, (b) jd rtds, partially due to new innovations, and (c) the launch of jdtf outside the united states. these increases were partially offset by lower spending for jdtf in the united states following the national introduction in late fiscal 2015 and for finlandia vodka.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
advertising expenses of $417 million decreased $20 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. underlying advertising expenses increased 2% after adjusting reported results for the positive effects of foreign exchange and the sale of southern comfort and tuaca. the increase in underlying advertising expenses was driven primarily by investments in the united states for woodford reserve, jdtw, and jdtf, as well as higher spending outside the united states on the jack daniel's family. these increases were partially offset by lower spending for southern comfort globally and finlandia vodka in many markets.

sg&a expenses of $667 million decreased $21 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, while underlying sg&a dropped 2% after adjusting reported results for the benefit of foreign exchange. the most significant contributors to the year-over-year decrease in underlying sg&a were lower compensation-related expenses and tight management of discretionary spending.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
sg&a expenses of $688 million decreased $9 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while underlying sg&a grew 2% after adjusting reported results for the positive effect of foreign exchange. the most significant contributors to the year-over-year increase in underlying sg&a were higher compensation and related expenses.

operating income was $989 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of $544 million, or 35%, compared to fiscal 2016. underlying operating income growth was 7% after adjusting for (a) the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, (b) the negative effect of foreign exchange, and (c) the estimated net change in distributor inventories, driven primarily by the united states and russia. the same factors that contributed to the growth in underlying gross profit also contributed to the growth in underlying operating income, enhanced by meaningful operating expense leverage as sg&a spend declined and underlying advertising expenses grew 2% compared to underlying net sales growth of 3%.
39
operating margin declined 16.6 percentage points to 33.0% in fiscal 2017 from 49.6% in fiscal 2016. the decrease in our operating margin was primarily due to the net 16.6 percentage point effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the negative effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by a reduction in sg&a spend.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
operating income was $1,533 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $506 million, or 49%, compared to fiscal 2015. underlying operating income growth was 8% after adjusting for (a) the positive effect of the sale of southern comfort and tuaca; (b) the negative effect of foreign exchange related to the broad strengthening of the dollar; and (c) the estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, driven primarily by the absence of the distributor inventory increase in the united states associated with the nationwide rollout of jdtf in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. the same factors that contributed to the growth in underlying gross profit also contributed to the growth in underlying operating income, enhanced by a slower rate of growth in operating expenses.
operating margin grew 16.8 percentage points to 49.6% in fiscal 2016 from 32.8% in fiscal 2015. the increase in our operating margin was primarily due to the sale of southern comfort and tuaca, which increased our operating margin 15.7 percentage points. in addition, the slower rate of growth in operating expenses compared to the gross profit growth rate also contributed to the operating margin expansion.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
interest expense (net) increased $12 million, or 29%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to our july 2016 issuance of €300 million 1.20% and £300 million 2.60% senior unsecured notes due on july 7, 2026 and july 7, 2028, respectively.
our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were 28.3%. a decrease in the beneficial impact of foreign earnings at lower rates and an increase in foreign exchange gains in non-u.s. entities that are currently subject to u.s. tax were offset by an increase in the tax benefit related to discrete items. additionally, the absence of the beneficial impact of the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business was primarily offset by the beneficial impact of the excess tax benefits from stock-based awards.
diluted earnings per share were $1.71 in fiscal 2017, down 34% from $2.61 in fiscal 2016. this decrease resulted from the same factors that contributed to the decrease in reported operating income, including (a) the absence of the $0.88 gain from the sale of southern comfort and tuaca in fiscal 2016, (b) the absence of net income contribution from those brands, and (c) higher interest expense in fiscal 2017, partially offset by (d) a reduction in shares outstanding due to share repurchases.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
interest expense (net) increased $19 million, or 70%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to our june 2015 issuance of $500 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes due on july 15, 2045 and the increase in our commercial paper borrowing.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 28.3% compared to 31.7% in fiscal 2015. the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by an increase in the beneficial impact of foreign earnings and the impact of the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business.
diluted earnings per share were $2.61 in fiscal 2016, up 63% from $1.60 in fiscal 2015. this increase resulted from (a) the same factors that contributed to the increase in operating income, including $0.88 from the sale of southern comfort and tuaca, (b) the reduction in the shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases, and (c) the decrease in the effective tax rate.

liquidity and capital resources our ability to generate cash from operations consistently is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people, invest in our brands, invest in our assets, pay dividends, make strategic acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value, repurchase shares of common stock, and, from time to time, pay special dividends. investment-grade credit ratings (a1 by moody's, a by fitch, and a- by standard & poor's) provide us with financial flexibility when accessing global credit markets. we believe cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our expected operating and capital requirements.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
cash and cash equivalents declined $81 million in fiscal 2017, compared to a decline of $107 million in fiscal 2016. cash provided by operations of $639 million was up $115 million from last year, largely reflecting the absence of a $125 million payment made during fiscal 2016 for estimated income taxes incurred on the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business. cash used for investing activities was $422 million during fiscal 2017, an increase of $855 million over the $433 million in cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016. the increase of $855 million largely reflects the impact of the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business (for which we received cash of $543 million) in fiscal 2016 and the acquisition of benriach (for which we paid cash of $307 million) in fiscal 2017.
cash used for financing activities was $285 million during fiscal 2017, compared to $1,060 million during fiscal 2016. the $775 million decrease in cash used for financing activities largely reflects a $546 million decrease in share repurchases and a $477 million increase in proceeds from long-term debt net of repayments, partially offset by a $202 million decline in net proceeds from short-term borrowings and the payment of $30 million in november 2016 to settle an obligation related to our acquisition of benriach. the impact on cash and cash equivalents as a result of exchange rate changes was a decline of $13 million for fiscal 2017, compared to a decline of $4 million in the prior fiscal year.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cash and cash equivalents decreased $107 million during fiscal 2016, compared to a decrease of $67 million during fiscal 2015. cash provided by operations during fiscal 2016 was $524 million, compared to $608 million in fiscal 2015. the $84 million decline was primarily due to a $55 million increase in income tax payments, largely reflecting a $125 million payment made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 for the estimated taxes incurred on the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business, partially offset by the absence of $64 million paid during fiscal 2015 in connection with an intercompany transfer of assets. the decline in cash provided by operations also reflected a $14 million increase in interest payments, due to higher debt balances and interest rates.
41
cash provided by investing activities was $433 million in fiscal 2016. the increase of $558 million over fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds of $543 million from the sale of the southern comfort and tuaca business in fiscal 2016. cash used for financing activities was $1,060 million during fiscal 2016, compared to $531 million for fiscal 2015. the $529 million increase largely reflected a $645 million increase in share repurchases and the repayment of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.5% notes that matured in january 2016, partially offset by proceeds of $490 million from the issuance of 4.50% senior notes due 2045 issued in june 2015, and an $80 million increase in short-term borrowings. the impact on cash and cash equivalents as a result of exchange rate changes was a decline of $4 million in fiscal 2016, compared to a decline of $19 million in fiscal 2015.
capital expenditures investments in property, plant, and equipment were $120 million in fiscal 2015, $108 million in fiscal 2016, and $112 million in fiscal 2017. average expenditures over those three fiscal years were 61% higher than our average expenditures in the previous five fiscal years. approximately 80% of total spend in fiscal 2017 related to production operations that continued to expand capacity, reduce costs, and build our brands. our focus has been building our american whiskey brands, with an emphasis on jdtw, woodford reserve, and old forester.
for fiscal 2018, we expect to spend up to $140 million in capital expenditures. our capital spending plans for fiscal 2018 include continued investment in our american whiskey brands, led by spending on our shipping warehouse facility at jack daniel's and the old forester distillery and homeplace. in addition, we will continue building a new distillery and consumer experience on the historic slane castle estate in ireland. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 to remain elevated as we complete several key, multiyear projects.
share repurchases we have repurchased approximately 46.2 million shares of our common stock since the beginning of fiscal 2014. the following table summarizes information about those share repurchases by period.

we repurchased these shares under three separate repurchase programs, including the most recent $1 billion program that began on april 1, 2016, and concluded on march 31, 2017. under the most recent program, we have repurchased a total of 14,159,578 shares for approximately $670 million.

liquidity we continue to manage liquidity conservatively to meet current obligations, fund capital expenditures, maintain dividends, and repurchase shares from time to time while reserving adequate debt capacity for acquisition opportunities.
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have access to several liquidity sources to supplement our cash flow from operations. one of those sources is our $800 million commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund our short-term credit needs and to maintain our access to the capital markets. during fiscal 2016, our commercial paper borrowings averaged
42
$331 million, with an average maturity of 29 days and an average interest rate of 0.42%. during fiscal 2017, our commercial paper borrowings averaged $576 million, with an average maturity of 31 days and an average interest rate of 0.69%. commercial paper outstanding was $269 million at april 30, 2016, and $208 million at april 30, 2017.
our commercial paper program is supported with available commitments under our currently undrawn $800 million bank credit facility that matures on november 20, 2018. further, we believe that the markets for investment-grade bonds and private placements are accessible sources of long-term financing that could meet any additional liquidity needs. although unlikely, under extreme market conditions, one or more participating banks may not be able to fully fund its commitments under our credit facility.
we have high credit standards when initiating transactions with counterparties, and we closely monitor our counterparty risks with respect to our cash balances and derivative contracts. if a counterparty's credit quality were to deteriorate below our credit standards, we would expect either to liquidate exposures or require the counterparty to post appropriate collateral.
as of april 30, 2017, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $182 million. of this amount, $153 million was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we expect to reinvest indefinitely outside of the united states. we do not expect to need the cash generated by those foreign subsidiaries to fund our domestic operations. in the unforeseen event that we were to repatriate cash from those foreign subsidiaries, we would be required to provide for and pay u.s. taxes on permanently repatriated earnings. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the taxes that would have been provided on the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries if not considered indefinitely reinvested.
as announced on may 24, 2017, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.1825 per share on our class a and class b common stock. stockholders of record on june 5, 2017, will receive the dividend on july 3, 2017.
we believe our current liquidity position is strong and sufficient to meet all of our future financial commitments. a quantitative covenant of our $800 million bank credit facility requires the ratio of consolidated ebitda (as defined in the agreement) to consolidated interest expense to be at least 3 to 1. at april 30, 2017, with a ratio of 18 to 1, we were well within the covenant's parameters.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of april 30, 2017, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
long-term obligations we have long-term obligations related to contracts, leases, borrowing arrangements, and employee benefit plans that we enter into in the normal course of business (see notes 4, 5, and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). the following table summarizes the amounts of those obligations as of april 30, 2017, and the years when they must be paid:

1   excludes liabilities for tax uncertainties, as we cannot reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.
2   as of april 30, 2017, we have unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations of $322 million. because we cannot determine the specific periods in which those obligations will be funded, the table above reflects no amounts related to those obligations other than the $38 million of expected contributions (including $30 million of expected discretionary contributions) in fiscal 2018.
3   as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we have obligations to purchase agave, a plant whose sap forms the raw material for tequila. as of april 30, 2017, based on current market prices, obligations under these contracts totaled $4 million. because we cannot determine the specific periods in which those obligations will be paid, the above table reflects only the total related to those obligations.
we expect to meet these obligations with internally generated funds.

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect some estimates involved in applying the following critical accounting policies that entail uncertainties and subjectivity. using different estimates or policies could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.
goodwill and other intangible assets we have obtained most of our brands by acquiring other companies. when we acquire another company, we first allocate the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible brand names and trademarks ("brand names"), based on estimated fair value. we then record any remaining purchase price as goodwill. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. we consider all of our brand names to have indefinite lives.
we assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. if an asset's fair value is less than its book value, we write it down to its estimated fair value. for goodwill, if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as in a business combination, to the goodwill's book value. we estimate the reporting unit's fair value using discounted estimated future cash flows or market information. we typically estimate the fair value of a brand name using either the "relief from royalty" or "excess earnings" method. we also consider market values for similar assets when available. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including making assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, and royalty rates.
we have the option, before quantifying the fair value of a reporting unit or brand name, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill or brand names are impaired. if we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. that assessment also takes considerable management judgment.
based on our assumptions, we believe none of our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired. further, we estimate the fair values to substantially exceed the carrying values of all of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans as well as postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits. benefits are based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. we expense the benefits expected to be paid over employees' expected service. this requires us to make assumptions to determine the net benefit expense and obligations, such as interest rates, return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases, expected service, and health care cost trend rates.
the assets, obligations, and assumptions used to measure pension and retiree medical expenses are determined at the beginning of the year ("measurement date"). because obligations are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate is a significant assumption. it is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt at each measurement date. the expected return on pension plan assets reflects expected capital market returns for each asset class that are based on historical returns, adjusted for the expected effects of diversification and active management (net of fees) of the assets. the other assumptions also reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.
beginning in fiscal 2018, we plan to change the method used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the new estimation approach will discount the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. previously, we estimated these service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. we believe the new approach will provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. we will account for this change in estimate prospectively, beginning may 1, 2017. the new approach will not affect the measurement of our plan obligations, but will generally result in lower service cost and interest cost in periods when the yield curve is upward-sloping. for fiscal 2018, we estimate that using the new estimation approach will reduce total service and interest cost by approximately $7 million when compared to the cost computed using the prior approach.
income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. we establish liabilities when some positions are likely to be challenged and may not succeed, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. we believe current liabilities are appropriate for all known contingencies, but this situation could change.

years can elapse before we can resolve a particular matter for which we have established a tax liability. although predicting the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter can be difficult, we believe our liabilities reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies. unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could require use of our cash. conversely, a favorable resolution could result in reduced cash tax payments, the reversal of previously established liabilities, or some combination of these results, which could reduce our effective tax rate.
new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note 1 to the accompanying financial statements, we are currently evaluating the potential impact of several new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the next few years.

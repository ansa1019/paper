89  fifth third bancorp reports of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors of fifth third bancorp:
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of fifth third bancorp and subsidiaries (the bancorp) as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2017, of the bancorp and our report dated february 28, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
basis for opinion the bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements assessment as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the bancorp in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

96  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements
1. summary of significant accounting and reporting policies nature of operations fifth third bancorp, an ohio corporation, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries from banking centers located throughout the midwestern and southeastern regions of the united states.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and vies in which the bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the bancorp has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, but upon which the bancorp does not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and not consolidated. the investments in those entities in which the bancorp does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value. intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated entities have been eliminated.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items in the process of collection and due from banks. currency and coin includes both u.s. and foreign currency owned and held at fifth third offices and that is in-transit to the frb. cash items in the process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on another depository institution or the frb that are payable immediately upon presentation in the u.s. balances due from banks include noninterest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the frb.
securities securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading on the date of purchase. only those securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in oci. trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income. the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments or dcf models that incorporate market inputs and assumptions including discount rates, prepayment speeds and loss rates. realized securities gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly for possible otti. for debt securities, if the bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an otti has occurred. however, even if the bancorp does not intend to sell the debt security and will not likely be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, the bancorp must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. in the event of a credit loss, the credit component of the impairment is recognized within noninterest income and the non-credit component is recognized through oci. for equity securities, the bancorps management evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale portfolio for otti on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the bancorps intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. if it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the security and its fair value is recognized within noninterest income.
portfolio loans and leases basis of accounting portfolio loans and leases are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred direct loan origination fees and costs and any direct principal charge-offs. direct loan origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount is amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield adjustment. interest income is recognized based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method.
loans acquired by the bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the bancorp does not carry over the acquired companys alll, nor does the bancorp add to its existing alll as part of purchase accounting.
purchased loans are evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. for loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair value discount or premium is amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. for loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration, the bancorp determines at the acquisition date the excess of the loans contractually required payments over all cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be accreted into interest income (nonaccretable difference). the remaining amount representing the difference in the expected cash flows of acquired loans and the initial investment in the acquired loans is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans (accretable yield). subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows resulting directly from a change in the contractual interest rate are recognized prospectively as a reduction of the accretable yield. the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date as a result of credit deterioration is recognized by recording an alll or a direct charge-off. subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required alll are similar to originated loans. this method of accounting for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality does not apply to loans carried at fair value, residential mortgage loans held for sale and loans under revolving credit agreements.
the bancorps lease portfolio consists of both direct financing and leveraged leases. direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. interest income on direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment.
97  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements leveraged leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. interest income on leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive.
nonaccrual loans and leases when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and amortization/accretion of deferred net direct loan origination fees or costs are discontinued and all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income. commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrowers cash flows may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. such loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. the bancorp classifies residential mortgage loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 150 days as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. residential mortgage loans may stay on nonaccrual status for an extended time as the foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. home equity loans and lines of credit are reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. home equity loans and lines of credit that have been in default for 60 days or more are also reported on nonaccrual status if the senior lien has been in default 120 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have been modified in a tdr and subsequently become past due 90 days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. commercial and credit card loans that have been modified in a tdr are classified as nonaccrual unless such loans have sustained repayment performance of six months or more and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the restructured terms. well-secured loans are collateralized by perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for which the bancorp estimates proceeds from the sale would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of the loan and pay all costs to sell the collateral. the bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or legal action is proceeding and the bancorp expects to collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest balance.
nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans are generally accounted for on the cost recovery method. the bancorp believes the cost recovery method is appropriate for nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans because the assessment of collectability of the remaining recorded investment of these loans involves a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the nature or absence of underlying collateral. under the cost recovery method, any payments received are applied to reduce principal. once the entire recorded investment is collected, additional payments received are treated as recoveries of amounts previously charged-off until recovered in full, and any subsequent payments are treated as interest income. nonaccrual residential mortgage loans and other nonaccrual consumer loans are generally accounted for on the cash basis method. the bancorp believes the cash basis method is appropriate for nonaccrual residential mortgage and other nonaccrual consumer loans because such loans have generally been written down to estimated collateral values and the collectability of the remaining investment involves only an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which can be measured more objectively with a lesser degree of uncertainty than assessments of typical commercial loan collateral. under the cash basis method, interest income is recognized when cash is received, to the extent such income would have been accrued on the loans remaining balance at the contractual rate. nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the loan agreement and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.
commercial loans on nonaccrual status, including those modified in a tdr, as well as criticized commercial loans with aggregate borrower relationships exceeding $1 million, are subject to an individual review to identify charge-offs. the bancorp does not have an established delinquency threshold for partially or fully charging off commercial loans. residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and credit card loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days are assessed for a charge-off to the alll, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. home equity loans and lines of credit are also assessed for charge-off to the alll when such loans or lines of credit have become past due 120 days if the senior lien is also 120 days past due, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 120 days are assessed for a charge-off to the alll, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection.
restructured loans and leases a loan is accounted for as a tdr if the bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. a tdr typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk. in 2012, the occ, a national bank regulatory agency, issued interpretive guidance that requires non-reaffirmed loans included in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings to be accounted for as nonperforming tdrs and collateral dependent loans regardless of their payment history and capacity to pay in the future. the bancorps banking subsidiary is a state chartered bank which therefore is not subject to guidance of the occ. the bancorp does not consider the bankruptcy courts discharge of the borrowers debt a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed and as such, these loans are classified as tdrs only if one or more of the previously mentioned concessions are granted.
the bancorp measures the impairment loss of a tdr based on the difference between the original loans carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original, effective yield of the loan. residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. commercial loans and credit card loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or more prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms.
98  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements tdrs of commercial loans and credit cards that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or more in accordance with their modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six month payment history is sustained. in certain cases, commercial tdrs on nonaccrual status may be accounted for using the cash basis method for income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal under the modified terms of the loan is reasonably assured.
impaired loans and leases a loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the bancorp will be unable to collect all amounts due (including both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. impaired loans generally consist of nonaccrual loans and leases, loans modified in a tdr and loans over $1 million that are currently on accrual status and not yet modified in a tdr, but for which the bancorp has determined that it is probable that it will grant a payment concession in the near term due to the borrowers financial difficulties. for loans modified in a tdr, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the terms specified in the original loan agreement. a loan restructured in a tdr is no longer considered impaired in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement specifies a rate equal to or greater than the rate the bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. refer to the alll section for discussion regarding the bancorps methodology for identifying impaired loans and determination of the need for a loss accrual.
loans and leases held for sale loans and leases held for sale primarily represent conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell in the secondary market and jumbo residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, other residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans that management has the intent to sell. loans and leases held for sale may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at fair value where the bancorp has elected the fair value option of accounting under u.s. gaap. the bancorp has elected to measure certain groups of loans held for sale under the fair value option, including certain residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale and certain purchased commercial loans designated as held for sale at acquisition. for loans in which the bancorp has not elected the fair value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the individual loan level.
the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain arm loans, dcf models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. the anticipated portfolio composition includes the effects of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the arm margin. these fair value marks are recorded as a component of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue. the bancorp generally has commitments to sell residential mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market. gains or losses on sales are recognized in mortgage banking net revenue.
managements intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and, thereafter, reported within the bancorps residential mortgage class of portfolio loans and leases. in such cases, the residential mortgage loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component.
loans and leases held for sale are placed on nonaccrual status consistent with the bancorps nonaccrual policy for portfolio loans and leases.
other real estate owned oreo, which is included in other assets, represents property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. all oreo property is periodically evaluated for impairment and decreases in carrying value are recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. for government-guaranteed mortgage loans, upon foreclosure, a separate other receivable is recognized if certain conditions are met for the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. this receivable is also included in other assets, separate from oreo, in the consolidated balance sheets.
alll the bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the alll. the bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. the bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. classes within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leasing. the residential mortgage portfolio segment is also considered a class. classes within the consumer portfolio segment include home equity, automobile, credit card and other consumer loans and leases. for an analysis of the bancorps alll by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to note 6.
the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. the alll is maintained at a level the bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll. provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. the bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.
the bancorps methodology for determining the alll is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a tdr and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. allowances on individual commercial loans, tdrs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.
99  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a tdr, are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. when individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the bancorp. allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. the bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.
historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. the loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. the risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.
homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends and refreshed fico score trends.
the bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the alll. these include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
the bancorps primary market areas for lending are the midwestern and southeastern regions of the u.s. when evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the bancorps customers.
in the current year, the bancorp has not substantively changed any material aspect to its overall approach to determining its alll for any of its portfolio segments. there have been no material changes in criteria or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period alll for any of the bancorps portfolio segments.
reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the bancorps alll, as previously discussed. net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
loan sales and securitizations the bancorp periodically sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies. the sold loans are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the time of sale. the bancorp typically isolates the loans through the use of a vie and thus is required to assess whether the entity holding the sold or securitized loans is a vie and whether the bancorp is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidator of that vie. if the bancorp holds the power to direct activities most significant to the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie, then the bancorp will generally be deemed the primary beneficiary of the vie. if the bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a vie but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate. refer to note 11 for further information on consolidated and non-consolidated vies.
the bancorps loan sales and securitizations are generally structured with servicing retained, which often results in the recording of servicing rights. the bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. upon this election, all servicing rights are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the changes occur. the election of the fair value method did not require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as there was no difference between the carrying value of the servicing rights, net of valuation allowance, and the fair value.
servicing rights are valued using internal oas models. key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the oas spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. the primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. in order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of the key assumptions utilized in the internal oas model.
prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. servicing rights were tested for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance.
100  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements amortization and provisions for impairment of servicing rights were recorded as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
fees received for servicing loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income as loan payments are received. costs of servicing loans are charged to expense as incurred.
reserve for representation and warranty provisions conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. a contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. the bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. the bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve related to various representations and warranties that reflects managements estimate of losses based on a combination of factors.
the bancorps estimation process requires management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as future demand expectations, economic factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss severity and any additional information obtained from the gses regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. at the time of a loan sale, the bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the bancorps guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and reasonably estimable. the provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in other noninterest income at the time of sale. updates to the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense.
legal contingencies the bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. the bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. an accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. this accrual is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
bank premises and equipment and other long-lived assets bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate, the bancorp tests its long-lived assets for impairment by determining whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a long-lived asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group through a probability-weighted approach. in the event the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income as incurred.
derivative financial instruments the bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value through adjustments to aoci and/or current earnings, as appropriate. on the date the bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the bancorp designates the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. for a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income. for a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument, to the extent that it is effective, are recorded in aoci and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. for free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period net income.
prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the bancorp formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. this process includes linking the derivative instrument designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk being hedged, along with a formal assessment at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. if it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.
tax receivable agreements in conjunction with vantiv, inc.s ipo in 2012, the bancorp entered into two tras with vantiv, inc. the tras provide for payments by vantiv, inc. to the bancorp of 85% of the cash savings actually realized as a result of the increase in tax basis that results from the historical or future purchase of equity in vantiv holding, llc from the bancorp or from the exchange of equity units in vantiv holding, llc for cash or class a stock, as well as any tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tra. any actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments made under the tra depend on a number of uncertain factors, the most significant of which is the realization of the tax benefits by vantiv, inc., which depends on the amount and timing of vantiv, inc.s reportable taxable income. the bancorp accounts for these tras as gain contingencies and recognizes income when all uncertainties surrounding the realization of such amounts are resolved.
101  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes the bancorp accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences. under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. the net balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in other assets and accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. any effect of a change in federal or state tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. the bancorp reflects the expected amount of income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit. accrued taxes represent the net expected amount due to and/or from taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.
the bancorp evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets based on all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date. realization of deferred tax assets is based on the bancorps judgment about relevant factors affecting their realization, including the taxable income within any applicable carryback periods, future projected taxable income, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and tax-planning strategies. the bancorp records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where the bancorp does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if the bancorp believes that it is more-likely-than-not that the uncertain tax position will be sustained based solely on the technical merits of the tax position and consideration of the relevant taxing authoritys widely understood administrative practices and precedents. if the bancorp does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the bancorp records a liability for the uncertain tax position. if the bancorp believes that it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the bancorp only records a tax benefit for the portion of the uncertain tax position where the likelihood of realization is greater than 50% upon settlement with the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. the bancorp recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within current income tax expense. refer to note 20 for further discussion regarding income taxes.
earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. earnings per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. dilutive common stock equivalents represent the exercise of dilutive stock-based awards and the dilutive effect of the settlement of outstanding forward contracts.
the bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. the two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share separately for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. for purposes of calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, restricted shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities until vested. while the dividends declared per share on such restricted shares are the same as dividends declared per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on restricted shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense during the period when forfeiture is expected.
goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the bancorp is september 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. the bancorp has determined that its segments qualify as reporting units under u.s. gaap.
impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. in testing goodwill for impairment, u.s. gaap permits the bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the bancorp, the performance of the bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the bancorp determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test would be unnecessary. however, if the bancorp concludes otherwise or elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, it would then be required to perform the first step (step 1) of the goodwill impairment test, and continue to the second step (step 2), if necessary. step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. as none of the bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the bancorps stock price. to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. additionally, the bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.
when required to perform step 2, the bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. a recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.
102  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements during step 2, the bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. this assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. the bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as a result of this assignment process. refer to note 9 for further information regarding the bancorps goodwill.
fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.
u.s. gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
level 1  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the bancorp has the ability to access at the measurement date.
level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
level 3  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. unobservable inputs reflect the bancorps own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. the inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the bancorps own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and dcf methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.
the bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the bancorp on a quarterly basis. additionally, the bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. the bancorp may, as a practical expedient, measure the fair value of certain investments on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment, or its equivalent. any investments which are valued using this practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. refer to note 27 for further information on fair value measurements.
stock-based compensation the bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. all awards, both those with cliff vesting and graded vesting, are expensed on a straight-line basis. awards to employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed immediately. as compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. at the time awards are exercised, cancelled, expire or restrictions are released, the bancorp recognizes an adjustment to income tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. for further information on the bancorps stock-based compensation plans, refer to note 24.
pension plans the bancorp uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flow during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets. amortization of the net gain or loss resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. the bancorp uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of participating employees. this period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement mortality and other applicable employee demographics.
other securities and other property held by fifth third wealth and asset management, a division of the bancorps banking subsidiary, in a fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the consolidated balance sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. wealth and asset management revenue in the consolidated statements of income is recognized on the accrual basis. wealth and asset management service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of average account balances associated with individual contracts.
the bancorp recognizes revenue from its card and processing services on an accrual basis as such services are performed, recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the bancorp. the bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies.
103  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorp invests in these policies, known as boli, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. the bancorp records these boli policies within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at each policys respective cash surrender value, with changes recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.
intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, customer lists, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and rent intangibles. intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. the bancorp reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and included in other short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest.
acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. reissuance of shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific identification method.
advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred.
accounting and reporting developments standards adopted in 2017
the bancorp adopted the following new accounting standards effective january 1, 2017:
asu 2016-05  derivatives and hedging (topic 815): effect of derivative contract novations on existing hedge accounting relationships in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-05 which clarifies that a change in counterparty in a derivative contract does not, in and of itself, represent a change in critical terms that would require discontinuation of hedge accounting provided that other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2016-06  derivatives and hedging (topic 815): contingent put and call options in debt instruments in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-06 which clarifies the requirements for determining when contingent put and call options embedded in debt instruments should be bifurcated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as derivatives. a four-step decision sequence should be followed in determining whether such options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the debt instrument, which determines whether bifurcation is necessary. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2017 on a modified retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2016-07  investmentsequity method and joint ventures (topic 323): simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-07 to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. the amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investors previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting, eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting back to the date of the initial investment. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2016-17  consolidation (topic 810): interests held through related parties that are under common control in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-17 which changes the accounting for the consolidation of vies in certain situations involving entities under common control. specifically, the amendments change how the indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control should be included in a reporting entitys evaluation of whether it is a primary beneficiary of a vie. under the amended guidance, the reporting entity is only required to include the indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control in a vie on a proportionate basis. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance retrospectively on january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
standards issued but not yet adopted the following accounting standards were issued but not yet adopted by the bancorp as of december 31, 2017:
asu 2014-09  revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09 which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. subsequent to the issuance of asu 2014-09, the fasb has issued additional guidance to clarify certain implementation issues, including asus 2016-08 (principal versus agent considerations), 2016-10 (identifying performance obligations and licensing), 2016-12 (narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients), and 2016-20 (technical corrections and improvements) in march, april, may and december 2016, respectively. these amendments do not change the core principles in asu 2014-09 and the effective date and transition requirements are consistent with those in the original asu. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach. because the amended guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other u.s. gaap, the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on the bancorps consolidated financial statements. however, effective with the filing of the bancorps first quarter of 2018 form 10-q, the bancorp will be subject to expanded disclosure requirements and after adoption has updated its revenue recognition policies and procedures. while the bancorp has concluded the following changes are not material to its consolidated financial statements, upon adoption the bancorp changed its presentation of certain underwriting expenses incurred by its broker-dealer subsidiary from net to gross presentation and also changed its presentation of certain credit card rewards program expenses from gross to net presentation. these changes will be reflected in the bancorps first quarter of 2018 form 10-q and neither change had an impact on income before income taxes or net income.
104  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements asu 2016-01  financial instrumentsoverall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01 which revises an entitys accounting related to 1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities, 2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value, and 3) certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. the amendments require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. however, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes as a result of an observable price change. the amendments also simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value is not readily determinable by requiring an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. if qualitative indicators are identified, the entity will be required to measure the investment at fair value. for financial liabilities that an entity has elected to measure at fair value, the amendments require an entity to present separately in oci the portion of the change in fair value that results from a change in instrument-specific credit risk. for public business entities, the amendments 1) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and 2) require, for disclosure purposes, the use of an exit price notion in the determination of the fair value of financial instruments. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2018. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. however, for certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value that are not accounted for using the equity method, the bancorp has elected to use the permitted measurement alternative, which is to adjust the cost basis of the investment upon either the occurrence of an observable price change or the identification of an impairment. for these securities, the amended guidance was applied prospectively to investments that existed on or after january 1, 2018.
asu 2016-02  leases (topic 842)
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02 which establishes a new accounting model for leases. the amended guidance requires lessees to record lease liabilities on the lessees balance sheets along with corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the lessees statements of income. from a lessor perspective, the accounting model is largely unchanged, except that the amended guidance includes certain targeted improvements to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the revenue recognition guidance in asc topic 606. the amendments also modify disclosure requirements for an entitys lease arrangements. the amended guidance is effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. the amendments should be applied to each prior reporting period presented using a modified retrospective approach, although the amended guidance contains certain transition relief provisions that, among other things, permit an entity to elect not to reassess the classification of leases which existed or expired as of the date the amendments are effective. in january 2018, the fasb proposed additional amendments to the new guidance which, among other things, include an option to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption instead of applying the guidance to prior comparative periods, but these additional amendments are not yet final. the bancorp will adopt the amended guidance on the required effective date of january 1, 2019, and expects to elect the transition relief provisions. from a lessee perspective, the bancorp is currently finalizing its inventory of all leases, accumulating the lease data necessary to apply the amended guidance, and evaluating the business process and technology requirements which will be necessary after adoption. the bancorp is continuing to evaluate the impact of the amended guidance on its consolidated financial statements, but the effects of recognizing most operating leases on the consolidated balance sheets are expected to be material. the bancorp expects to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for substantially all of its operating lease commitments based on the present value of unpaid lease payments as of the date of adoption, but does not expect a material impact to expense recognition. from a lessor perspective, given the limited changes, the bancorp does not expect adoption of the amended guidance to have a material impact, based on its preliminary analysis. however, the bancorp is continuing to evaluate the impact of the amended guidance, particularly related to the deferral of costs incurred in originating leases. the bancorp also expects to record a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption to recognize any remaining deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions that occurred prior to the date of initial application. the bancorp had approximately $11 million of such deferred gains recorded as of december 31, 2017. these expectations may change as the implementation process continues.
asu 2016-04  liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilities (subtopic 405-20): recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-04 which permits proportional derecognition of the liability for unused funds on certain prepaid stored-value products (known as breakage) to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur. the amendments do not apply to any prepaid stored-value products that are attached to a segregated customer deposit account, or products for which unused funds are subject to unclaimed property remittance laws. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2016-13  financial instrumentscredit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13 which establishes a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. the new approach changes the impairment model for most financial assets, and will require the use of an expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments. this model applies to trade and other receivables, loans, debt securities, net investments in leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance). this model requires entities to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to collect. this allowance is deducted from the financial assets amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. the new expected credit loss model will also apply to purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, superseding current accounting guidance for such assets. the amended guidance also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, requiring entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such securities is a credit loss, and also eliminating the option for management to consider the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor in concluding whether or not a credit loss exists.
105  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the amended model states that an entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra account to the amortized cost basis, instead of a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as under current guidance. as a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities immediately in earnings as opposed to in interest income over time. there are also additional disclosure requirements included in this guidance. the amended guidance is effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2020. early adoption is permitted as soon as january 1, 2019, but the bancorp currently expects to adopt on the mandatory effective date. the amended guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. however, certain provisions of the guidance are only required to be applied on a prospective basis. while the bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its consolidated financial statements, it currently expects the alll to increase upon adoption given that the allowance will be required to cover the full remaining expected life of the portfolio upon adoption, rather than the incurred loss model under current u.s. gaap. the extent of this increase is still being evaluated and will depend on economic conditions and the composition of the bancorps loan and lease portfolio at the time of adoption.
asu 2016-15  statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15 to clarify the classification of certain cash receipts and payments within an entitys statement of cash flows. these items include debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of boli policies, distributions received from equity method investees, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. the amended guidance also specifies how to address classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance retrospectively on january 1, 2018 and will apply the requirements of this amended guidance in its first quarter of 2018 form 10-q. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2016-16  income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16 which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. current u.s. gaap prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and will apply the requirements of this amended guidance in its first quarter of 2018 form 10-q. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2017-01  business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01 which clarifies the definition of a business in order to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. the amended guidance provides a screen which states that when substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired (or disposed) is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, then the set of assets and activities would not be considered a business. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on january 1, 2018 and will apply this amended guidance to future transactions to determine if they should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
asu 2017-04  intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04 which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by removing the second step, which measures the amount of impairment loss, if any. instead, the amended guidance states that an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, except that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. this would apply to all reporting units, including those with zero or negative carrying amounts of net assets. the amended guidance is effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied prospectively to all goodwill impairment tests performed after the adoption date.
asu 2017-05  other incomegains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets (subtopic 610-20): clarifying the scope of asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets in february 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-05 which clarifies the scope of subtopic 610-20 and defines the term in substance nonfinancial asset. the amendments require that an entity should initially identify each distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset promised to a counterparty and derecognize each asset when a counterparty obtains control of it. the amendments provide specific guidance on accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets, which require an entity to derecognize a distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset in a partial sale transaction when it 1) does not have (or ceases to have) a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the asset and 2) transfers control of the asset. once an entity transfers control of a distinct nonfinancial asset or distinct in substance nonfinancial asset, it is required to measure any noncontrolling interest it receives (or retains) at fair value. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance on january 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2017-08 receivablesnonrefundable fees and other costs (subtopic 310-20): premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities in march 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-08 which shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. the amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. the amended guidance is effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. the bancorp shall provide a disclosure regarding the change in accounting principle. the bancorp plans to adopt the amended guidance on its required effective date of january 1, 2019 and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its consolidated financial statements. however, the bancorp does not currently expect the impact of adoption to be material.
106  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements asu 2017-09 compensationstock compensation (topic 718): scope of modification accounting in may 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-09 which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require the application of modification accounting in topic 718. the amendments specify that an entity should account for the effects of such changes as a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and classification (as an equity or liability) of the awards are all unaffected by the change. the bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on january 1, 2018. the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
asu 2017-12 derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12 which makes several amendments to existing guidance for hedge accounting. the amendments are intended to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance in current u.s. gaap, improve the alignment of financial reporting with an entitys risk management strategies and allow more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting. among other things, the amendments 1) permit hedge accounting for risk components in certain hedging relationships including nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk, 2) provide new alternatives for designating and measuring fair value changes in the hedged item for fair value hedges of interest rate risk, 3) modify the recognition and presentation requirements for the effects of hedging instruments, 4) allow entities to exclude certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and 5) ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. there are also additional modifications to disclosure requirements. as permitted, the bancorp elected to early adopt the amended guidance on january 1, 2018. the amended presentation and disclosure guidance was applied prospectively while the elimination of separate measurement of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges was applied on a modified retrospective basis by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, the amount of which was not material.

3. restrictions on cash, dividends and other capital actions reserve requirement the frb, under regulation d, requires that banks hold cash in reserve against deposit liabilities when total reservable deposit liabilities are greater than the regulatory exemption, known as the reserve requirement. the reserve requirement is calculated based on a two-week average of daily net transaction account deposits as defined by the frb and may be satisfied with average vault cash during the following two-week maintenance period. when vault cash is not sufficient to meet the reserve requirement, the remaining amount must be satisfied with average funds held at the frb. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorps banking subsidiary reserve requirement was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. additionally, the bancorps banking subsidiary average reserve requirement was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
restrictions on cash dividends the principal source of income and funds for the bancorp (parent company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. the dividends paid by the bancorps banking subsidiary are subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by state and federal supervisory agencies. the bancorps banking subsidiary paid the bancorps nonbank subsidiary holding company, which in turn paid the bancorp $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion in dividends during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the bancorps nonbank-subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year.
capital actions in 2011, the frb adopted the capital plan rule, which requires bhcs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review. under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the bhcs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. further, each bhc must also report to the frb the results of stress tests conducted by the bhc under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. the frb launched the 2017 stress testing program and ccar on february 3, 2017, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the frb due on april 5, 2017, which the bancorp submitted as required.
the frbs review of the capital plan assessed the comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. additionally, the frb reviewed the robustness of the capital adequacy process, the capital policy and the bancorps ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.
on june 28, 2017, the bancorp announced the results of its capital plan submitted to the frb as part of the 2017 ccar. for bhcs that proposed capital distributions in their plans, the frb either objected to the plan or provided a non-objection whereby the frb permitted the proposed capital distributions.
107  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the frb indicated to the bancorp that it did not object to the following capital actions for the period beginning july 1, 2017 and ending june 30, 2018:
●   the increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.16 from $0.14 beginning in the third quarter of
2017 and to $0.18 beginning in the second quarter of 2018;

●                                                       the repurchase of common shares in an amount up to $1.161 billion, or a 76% increase over the 2016
capital plan. these repurchases include $88 million in repurchases related to share issuances under employee benefit plans and $48 million in repurchases related to previously-recognized tra transaction after-tax gains;

●   the additional ability to repurchase common shares in the amount of any after-tax capital generated from the sale of vantiv, inc. common stock;

●                                                                        the additional ability to repurchase common shares in the amount of any after-tax cash income generated from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing tras with vantiv, inc. or potential future tras that may be generated from additional sales of vantiv, inc.

the bancorp recognized a gain on sale of vantiv, inc. shares of $1.0 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017 and also entered into accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. for more information related to these transactions, refer to note 19 and note 23. in the third quarter of 2017, the bancorp increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.16.

credit risk profile commercial portfolio segment for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the alll and monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leases.
to facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial portfolio segment, and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the alll for the commercial portfolio segment, the bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. the five categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter.
pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. all other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the calendar quarter.
the bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention. if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or the bancorps credit position.
the bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. substandard loans and leases have well defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected.
the bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. the possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.
loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged-off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible. because loans and leases in this category are fully charged-off, they are not included in the following tables.
the following tables summarize the credit risk profile of the bancorps commercial portfolio segment, by class:

the bancorps recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction was $235 million and $260 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
troubled debt restructurings if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. within each of the bancorps loan classes, tdrs typically involve either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loans maturity date with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loans accrued interest. modifying the terms of a loan may result in an increase or decrease to the alll depending upon the terms modified, the method used to measure the alll for a loan prior to modification, and whether any charge-offs were recorded on the loan before or at the time of modification. refer to the alll section of note 1 for information on the bancorps alll methodology. upon modification of a loan, the bancorp measures the related impairment as the difference between the estimated future cash flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at the original effective yield of the loan, and the carrying value of the loan. the resulting measurement may result in the need for minimal or no allowance because it is probable that all cash flows will be collected under the modified terms of the loan. in addition, if the stated interest rate was increased in a tdr, the cash flows on the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate as the discount rate, often exceed the recorded investment of the loan. conversely, upon a modification that reduces the stated interest rate on a loan, the bancorp recognizes an impairment loss as an increase to the alll. if a tdr involves a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loans accrued interest, that amount is charged-off to the alll.
the bancorp had commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in a tdr, consisting of line of credit and letter of credit commitments of $53 million and $78 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2017 compared with $82 million and $57 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.

the bancorp considers tdrs that become 90 days or more past due under the modified terms as subsequently defaulted. for commercial loans not subject to individual review for impairment, loss rates that are applied for purposes of determining the alll include historical losses associated with subsequent defaults on loans previously modified in a tdr. for consumer loans, the bancorp performs a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the consumer alll by comparing the consumer alll to forecasted consumer losses over the projected loss emergence period (the forecasted losses include the impact of subsequent defaults of consumer tdrs). when a residential mortgage, home equity, automobile or other consumer loan that has been modified in a tdr subsequently defaults, the present value of expected cash flows used in the measurement of the potential impairment loss is generally limited to the expected net proceeds from the sale of the loans underlying collateral and any resulting impairment loss is reflected as a charge-off or an increase in alll. the bancorp recognizes alll for the entire balance of the credit card loans modified in a tdr that subsequently default.

the bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. as part of this ongoing assessment, the bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. similarly, the bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion.
the bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. impairment losses associated with such assessments and lower of cost or market adjustments were $7 million, $32 million and $109 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the recognized impairment losses were recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.
gross occupancy expense for cancelable and noncancelable leases, which is included in net occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income, was $101 million, $100 million and $110 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was reduced by rental income from leased premises of $13 million, $16 million and $18 million during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable operating and capital lease agreements with respect to bank premises and equipment.

9. goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. acquisition activity includes acquisitions in the respective period in addition to purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions, if any. the bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30, 2017 by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. in performing this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking industry and market conditions and key financial metrics of the bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall bancorp financial performance. after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the bancorp determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the commercial banking, branch banking and wealth and asset management reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts and, therefore, the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary.
changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting unit, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

11. variable interest entities the bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve vies, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. the bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a vie and whether the bancorp is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. if the bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a vie, it must account for the vie as a consolidated subsidiary. if the bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a vie but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate.

automobile loan securitizations in a securitization transaction that occurred in september of 2017, the bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion in consumer automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a vie. this trust then subsequently issued approximately $1.0 billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $261 million were retained by the bancorp. refer to note 16 for further information. additionally, in prior years the bancorp completed securitization transactions in which the bancorp transferred certain consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts which were also deemed to be vies. the primary purposes of the vies were to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide the bancorp with access to liquidity for its originated loans. the bancorp retained residual interests in the vies and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. in addition, the bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies. as a result, the bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the vies and has consolidated these vies. the assets of the vies are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the vies. third-party holders of the notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the bancorp.
the economic performance of the vies is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. the principal risks to which the vies are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. the credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, overcollateralization, excess interest on the loans and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other classes.
cdc investments cdc, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the bancorp, was created to invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business and residential areas and preserve historic landmarks. cdc generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the property under development.
123  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and llcs and cdc typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity contributions. the economic performance of the vies is driven by the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as the vies ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. the bancorps subsidiaries serve as the managing member of certain llcs invested in business revitalization projects and have the right to make decisions that most significantly impact the economic performance of the llcs. additionally, the investor members do not own substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the managing member. the bancorp has provided an indemnification guarantee to the investor member of these llcs related to the qualification of tax credits generated by the investor members investment. accordingly, the bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and, therefore, has consolidated these vies. as a result, the investor members interests in these vies are presented as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. this presentation includes reporting separately the equity attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity and reporting separately the comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.
during the third quarter of 2017, the bancorps indemnification guarantee for one of the cdc investments for which a bancorp subsidiary served as the managing member expired and the bancorp transferred its remaining ownership interest in the vie to the investor member thus removing the bancorp from future operations of the vie. as a result, the bancorp deconsolidated the vie during the third quarter of 2017 resulting in a decrease of $27 million in commercial mortgage loans, a decrease of $20 million in alll associated with the commercial mortgage loans and a decrease of $18 million in indemnification guarantee exposure. the bancorps maximum exposure related to these indemnifications at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $17 million and $31 million, respectively, which is based on an amount required to meet the investor members defined target rate of return.
non-consolidated vies the following tables provide a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the consolidated balance sheets related to non-consolidated vies for which the bancorp holds an interest, but is not the primary beneficiary of the vie, as well as the bancorps maximum exposure to losses associated with its interests in the entities as of:

cdc investments as noted previously, cdc typically invests in vies as a limited partner or investor member in the form of equity contributions and has no substantive kick-out or substantive participating rights over the managing member. the bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies because it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the vies ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. this power is held by the managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the vies. accordingly, the bancorp accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, the bancorp recognized $68 million of impairment on certain affordable housing investments primarily due to the change in the federal statutory corporate tax rate pursuant to the tcja. this impairment charge was recorded in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income. refer to note 27 for further information.
the bancorps funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. the bancorps maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vies is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. the bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the vies that would expose the bancorp to a loss. in certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the vie has guaranteed a level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the bancorps risk.
at both december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorps cdc investments included $1.3 billion of investments in affordable housing tax credits recognized in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. the unfunded commitments related to these investments were $355 million and $349 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2017 are expected to be funded from 2018 to 2034.
124  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorp has accounted for all of its investments in qualified affordable housing tax credits using the equity method of accounting. the following table summarizes the impact to the consolidated statements of income relating to investments in qualified affordable housing investments:

private equity investments the bancorp, through fifth third capital holdings, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the bancorp, invests as a limited partner in private equity investments which provide the bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, while also creating cross-selling opportunities for the bancorps commercial products. each of the limited partnerships has an unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. the bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these private equity investments. the funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners capital contributions and investment returns. the bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not have the obligation to absorb the funds expected losses or the right to receive the funds expected residual returns that could potentially be significant to the funds and lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the funds. the bancorp, as a limited partner, does not have substantive participating or substantive kick-out rights over the general partner. therefore, the bancorp accounts for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting.
the bancorp is exposed to losses arising from the negative performance of the underlying investments in the private equity investments. as a limited partner, the bancorps maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded commitments. the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, are included in previous tables. also, at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorps unfunded commitment amounts to the private equity funds were $48 million and $56 million, respectively. as part of previous commitments, the bancorp made capital contributions to private equity investments of $11 million and $14 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the bancorp recognized a gain of $11 million on the sales of certain private equity funds during the year ended december 31, 2017. the bancorp recognized $1 million, $9 million and $1 million of otti primarily associated with certain nonconforming investments affected by the volcker rule during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, respectively. refer to note 27 for further information.
loans provided to vies the bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated vies sponsored by third parties. these vies are generally established to finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. the entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from the bancorp or a syndication through which the bancorp is involved. the sponsor/administrator of the entities is responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the vies. because the sponsor/administrator, not the bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures, the bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary.
the principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. the bancorps maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the vies. the bancorps outstanding loans to these vies are included in commercial loans in note 5. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorps unfunded commitments to these entities were $1.1 billion and $937 million, respectively. the loans and unfunded commitments to these vies are included in the bancorps overall analysis of the alll and reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively. the bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these vies.

residential mortgage loan sales the bancorp sold fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. in those sales, the bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and provided certain standard representations and warranties, however the investors have no recourse to the bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. the bancorp receives annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. the bancorp identifies classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest rates.

servicing rights effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. upon this election, all servicing rights are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the changes occur. the election of the fair value method did not require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as there was no difference between the carrying value of the servicing rights, net of valuation allowance, and the fair value.
prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. servicing rights were assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance.
the following tables present changes in the servicing rights related to residential mortgage and automobile loans for the years ended december 31:

the bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of the msr portfolio. this strategy may include the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various available-for-sale and trading securities.
126  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements the interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the msr portfolio caused by fluctuating oas spreads, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. the fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present value of expected future cash flows.

based on historical credit experience, expected credit losses for residential mortgage loan servicing assets have been deemed immaterial, as the bancorp sold the majority of the underlying loans without recourse. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp serviced $60.0 billion and $53.6 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans for other investors. the value of msrs that continue to be held by the bancorp is subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets.
at december 31, 2017, the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse changes in prepayment speed assumptions and immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in oas spread are as follows:

(a)   the impact of the weighted-average default rate on the current fair value of residual cash flows for all scenarios is immaterial.

these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. as the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. the bancorp believes variations of these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater.
also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held by the bancorp is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

13. derivative financial instruments the bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. additionally, the bancorp holds derivative instruments for the benefit of its commercial customers and for other business purposes. the bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative derivative positions.
the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the bancorps net interest margin and cash flows. derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options and swaptions. interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated notional amount and maturity date. interest rate floors protect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates. forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. options provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price. swaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap.
prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate msr portfolio, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. the bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, tba securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. principal-only swaps are total return swaps that are based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust. tba securities are a forward purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made.
foreign currency volatility occurs as the bancorp enters into certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. derivative instruments that the bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts.
the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes. the bancorp economically hedges significant exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable and independent counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. the bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. credit risk is minimized through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures.
the fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. cash collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts with the exception of certain variation margin payments that are considered legal settlements of the derivative contracts. for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the variation margin payments are applied to net the fair value of the respective derivative contracts.
the bancorps derivative assets include certain contractual features in which the bancorp requires the counterparties to provide collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in the fair value of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due to credit risk of the counterparty. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of collateral held by the bancorp for derivative assets was $409 million and $444 million, respectively. for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlement of the derivative contract, the payments for variation margin of $74 million were applied to reduce the respective derivative contracts and were also not included in the total amount of collateral held as of december 31, 2017. the credit component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets associated with customer accommodation contracts as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3 million and $6 million, respectively.
in measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the bancorp considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require collateral maintenance. when necessary, the bancorp posts collateral primarily in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair value due to the bancorps credit risk. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of collateral posted by the bancorp for derivative liabilities was $365 million and $399 million, respectively. additionally, $31 million of variation margin payments were applied to the respective derivative contracts to reduce the bancorps derivative liabilities as of december 31, 2017 and were also not included in the total amount of collateral posted. certain of the bancorps derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related contingent features that could result in the requirement to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of specified events. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was immaterial to the bancorps consolidated financial statements. the posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for further consideration of credit risk. as a result, the bancorp determined that the impact of the bancorps credit risk to the valuation of its derivative liabilities was immaterial to the bancorps consolidated financial statements.
the bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which hedge accounting is not established, are held as free-standing derivatives. all customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing derivatives.

fair value hedges the bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate funding to floating-rate. decisions to convert fixed-rate funding to floating are made primarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. for all interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of december 31, 2017, an assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis was performed and such swaps were accounted for using the long-haul method. the long-haul method requires a quarterly assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of ineffectiveness.
129  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements hedge ineffectiveness is the difference between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps hedging fixed-rate funding is reported within interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the following table reflects the change in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, included in the consolidated statements of income:

cash flow hedges the bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted transactions. the assets or liabilities may be grouped in circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the bancorp desires to hedge. the bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating-rate assets and liabilities. as of december 31, 2017, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by which the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged items expected cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. ineffectiveness is reported within other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the effective portion of the cumulative gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reported within aoci and are reclassified from aoci to current period earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. as of december 31, 2017, the maximum length of time over which the bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 24 months.
reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial and industrial loans are recorded within interest income in the consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, $9 million of net deferred losses, net of tax and $10 million of net deferred gains, net of tax, respectively, on cash flow hedges were recorded in aoci in the consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2017, $3 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, recorded in aoci are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. this amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to december 31, 2017.
during the years ended 2017 and 2016, there were no gains or losses reclassified from aoci into earnings associated with the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by u.s. gaap.

net income free-standing derivative instruments  risk management and other business purposes as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, tba securities and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate msr portfolio. principal-only swaps hedge the mortgage-libor spread because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. principal-only swaps also provide prepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to msrs that lose value in a faster prepayment environment. receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as expected.
the bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. irlcs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for sale are also considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
in conjunction with the initial sale of the bancorps 51% interest in vantiv holding, llc in 2009, the bancorp received a warrant which was accounted for as a free-standing derivative. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the bancorp both sold and exercised part of the warrant. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the bancorp exercised the remaining portion of the warrant.
in conjunction with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares in 2009, the bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares. this total return swap is accounted for as a free-standing derivative. refer to note 27 for further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of this instrument.

free-standing derivative instruments  customer accommodation the majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. these derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. these instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. the bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. the bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
the bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative contracts. the bancorp only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. the bancorp will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $5 million at december 31, 2017 and $4 million at december 31, 2016, which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2017, the risk participation agreements had a weighted-average remaining life of 2.9 years.
the bancorps maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. the bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio.
risk ratings of the notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table:

offsetting derivative financial instruments the bancorps derivative transactions are generally governed by isda master agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. when the bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office.
the bancorps policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place. however, for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties who have modified their rules to treat variation margin payments as settlements, the fair value of the respective derivative contracts are reported net of the variation margin payments.
collateral amounts included in the tables below consist primarily of cash and highly-rated government-backed securities and do not include variation margin payments for derivative contracts with legal rights of setoff for the year ended december 31, 2017.

fhlb advances at december 31, 2017, fhlb advances have rates ranging from 0.05% to 6.87%, with interest payable monthly. the bancorp has pledged $15.6 billion of certain residential mortgage loans and securities to secure its borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank which is partially utilized to fund $30 million in fhlb advances that are outstanding. the fhlb advances mature as follows: $4 million in 2018, $8 million in 2019, $3 million in 2020, $3 million in 2021, $1 million in 2022, and $11 million thereafter.
notes associated with consolidated vies as previously discussed in note 11, the bancorp was determined to be the primary beneficiary of various vies associated with certain automobile loan securitizations. third-party holders of this debt do not have recourse to the general assets of the bancorp. in a securitization transaction that occurred in september of 2017, the bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion in consumer automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which was deemed to be a vie. this trust then subsequently issued approximately $1.0 billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $261 million were retained by the bancorp, resulting in approximately $747 million of outstanding notes included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017. additionally, in prior years the bancorp completed securitization transactions in which the bancorp transferred certain consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts which were also deemed to be vies. as such, approximately $310 million of outstanding notes related to these vies were included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017.

commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. the bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the contract. fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the bancorps exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $161 million included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease portfolio.
risk ratings under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of december 31:

(a)   includes $7 and $1 issued on behalf of commercial customers to facilitate trade payments in u.s. dollars and foreign currencies which expire less than 1 year and between 1 - 5 years, respectively.

standby letters of credit accounted for approximately 99% of total letters of credit at both december 31, 2017 and 2016 and are considered guarantees in accordance with u.s. gaap. approximately 61% and 62% of the total standby letters of credit were collateralized as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in the event of nonperformance by the customers, the bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. the reserve related to these standby letters of credit, which is included in the total reserve for unfunded commitments, was $6 million at december 31, 2017 and $3 million at december 31, 2016. the bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with letters of credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease portfolio.

at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as vrdns. the bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the vrdns to investors. the vrdns pay interest to holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. the vrdns generally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. when the vrdns are tendered, a remarketing agent generally finds another investor to purchase the vrdns to keep the securities outstanding in the market. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, total vrdns in which the bancorp was the remarketing agent or were supported by a bancorp letter of credit were $602 million and $929 million, respectively, of which fts acted as the remarketing agent to issuers on $508 million and $784 million, respectively. as remarketing agent, fts is responsible for finding purchasers for vrdns that are put by investors. the bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $331 million and $609 million of the vrdns remarketed by fts, in addition to $94 million and $145 million in vrdns remarketed by third parties at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous table. the bancorp held $1 million and $6 million of these vrdns in its portfolio and classified them as trading securities at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale the bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. the outstanding notional amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of significant commitments table for all periods presented.
noncancelable operating lease obligations and other commitments the bancorps subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable lease agreements. the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements are shown in the summary of significant commitments table. the bancorp has also entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or services.
contingent liabilities legal claims there are legal claims pending against the bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. refer to note 18 for additional information regarding these proceedings.
guarantees the bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual arrangements as discussed in the following sections.
residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. a contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. the bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. for more information on how the bancorp establishes the residential mortgage repurchase reserve, refer to note 1.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp maintained reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty provisions totaling $9 million and $13 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
the bancorp uses the best information available when estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve; however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts reserved as of december 31, 2017, are reasonably possible. the bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately $11 million in excess of amounts reserved. this estimate was derived by modifying the key assumptions previously discussed to reflect managements judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. the actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably possible losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those previously discussed.
during both the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp paid $1 million in the form of make whole payments and repurchased $12 million and $17 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. total repurchase demand requests during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $15 million and $22 million, respectively. total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was $1 million at december 31, 2017 compared to $2 million at december 31, 2016.

residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse the bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the secondary market with credit recourse. in the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. the maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. in the event of nonperformance, the bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value securing the loan. the outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse were $312 million and $374 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the delinquency rates were 3.0% at december 31, 2017 and 3.2% at december 31, 2016. the bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on these loans sold with credit recourse of $5 million and $7 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. to determine the credit loss reserve, the bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio.
margin accounts fts, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the benefit of its customers. fts is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. the margin account balance held by the brokerage clearing agent was $15 million at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. in the event of any customer default, fts has rights to the underlying collateral provided. given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin accounts.
long-term borrowing obligations the bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities of $62 million at both december 31, 2017 and 2016.
visa litigation the bancorp, as a member bank of visa prior to visas reorganization and ipo (the ipo) of its class a common shares (the class a shares) in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to visas certificate of incorporation and by-laws and in accordance with their membership agreements. in accordance with visas by-laws prior to the ipo, the bancorp could have been required to indemnify visa for the bancorps proportional share of losses based on the pre-ipo membership interests. as part of its reorganization and ipo, the bancorps indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known or anticipated litigation (the covered litigation) as of the date of the restructuring. this modification triggered a requirement for the bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the indemnification liability.
in conjunction with the ipo, the bancorp received 10.1 million of visas class b common shares (the class b shares) based on the bancorps membership percentage in visa prior to the ipo. the class b shares are not transferable (other than to another member bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the ipo closing or the date which the covered litigation has been resolved; therefore, the bancorps class b shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. visa deposited $3 billion of the proceeds from the ipo into a litigation escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the covered litigation. since then, when visas litigation committee determined that the escrow account was insufficient; visa issued additional class a shares and deposited the proceeds from the sale of the class a shares into the litigation escrow account. when visa funded the litigation escrow account, the class b shares were subjected to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of class b shares into class a shares.
140  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements in 2009, the bancorp completed the sale of visa, inc. class b shares and entered into a total return swap in which the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares. the swap terminates on the later of the third anniversary of visas ipo or the date on which the covered litigation is settled. refer to note 27 for additional information on the valuation of the swap. the counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the class b shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion rate of the class b shares into class a shares caused by any covered litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. if actual judgments in, or settlements of, the covered litigation significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the class b shares could result in a scenario where the bancorps ultimate exposure associated with the covered litigation (the visa litigation exposure) exceeds the value of the class b shares owned by the swap counterparty (the class b value). in the event the bancorp concludes that it is probable that the visa litigation exposure exceeds the class b value, the bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap.
as of the date of the bancorps sale of the visa class b shares and through december 31, 2017, the bancorp has concluded that it is not probable that the visa litigation exposure will exceed the class b value. based on this determination, upon the sale of the class b shares, the bancorp reversed its net visa litigation reserve liability and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return swap. the fair value of the swap liability was $137 million and $91 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. refer to note 13 and note 27 for further information.
after the bancorps sale of the class b shares, visa has funded additional amounts into the litigation escrow account which have resulted in further dilutive adjustments to the conversion of class b shares into class a shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap, required the bancorp to make cash payments in varying amounts to the swap counterparty as follows:

18. legal and regulatory proceedings litigation visa/mastercard merchant interchange litigation in april 2006, the bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against visa®, mastercard ® and several other major financial institutions in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york (in re: payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation). the plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the u.s. and trade associations, claimed that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were unreasonable and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. in addition to being a named defendant, the bancorp is also subject to a possible indemnification obligation of visa as discussed in note 17 and has also entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa, mastercard and certain other named defendants. in october 2012, the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement agreement. on january 14, 2014, the trial court entered a final order approving the class settlement. a number of merchants filed appeals from that approval. the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit held a hearing on those appeals and on june 30, 2016, reversed the district courts approval of the class settlement, remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. on march 27, 2017, the supreme court of the united states denied a petition for writ of certiorari seeking to review the second circuits decision. pursuant to the terms of the overturned settlement agreement, the bancorp previously paid $46 million into a class settlement escrow account. because the appellate court ruling remands the case to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. approximately 8,000 merchants requested exclusion from the class settlement, and therefore, pursuant to the terms of the overturned settlement agreement, approximately 25% of the funds paid into the class settlement escrow account were already returned to the control of the defendants. the remaining approximately 75% of the settlement funds paid by the bancorp are maintained in the escrow account. more than 500 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class filed separate federal lawsuits against visa, mastercard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. these individual federal lawsuits were transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york. while the bancorp is only named as a defendant in one of the individual federal lawsuits, it may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted above. refer to note 17 for further information.

other litigation the bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation. however, there are other litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. while it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes that the resulting liability, if any, from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the bancorps consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
governmental investigations and proceedings the bancorp and/or its affiliates are or may become involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the frb, cfpb, sec, finra, u.s. department of justice, etc., as well as state and other governmental authorities and self-regulatory bodies regarding their respective businesses. additional matters will likely arise from time to time. any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences to the bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the bancorps sec filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. investigations by regulatory authorities may from time to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement. additionally, in some cases, regulatory authorities may take supervisory actions that are considered to be confidential supervisory information which may not be publicly disclosed.
reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals the bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. the following factors, among others, contribute to this lack of predictability: claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated. as a result of these factors, the bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. an accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. any such accrual is adjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. the bancorp also determines, when possible (due to the uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued. under u.s. gaap, an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. for matters where the bancorp is able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to legal and regulatory proceedings in an aggregate amount up to approximately $31 million in excess of amounts accrued, with it also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. the estimates included in this amount are based on the bancorps analysis of currently available information, and as new information is obtained the bancorp may change its estimates.
for these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the established accrual that cannot be estimated. based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established accruals, the bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the bancorps consolidated financial position. however, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the bancorps results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.

on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation known as the tcja. the tcja makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the top federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. u.s. gaap requires the bancorp to recognize the tax effects of changes in tax laws and rates on its deferred taxes in the period in which the law is enacted. as a result, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $220 million.
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the bancorps unrecognized tax benefits:

(a)   amounts represent unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate.

the bancorps unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to state income tax exposures from taking tax positions where the bancorp believes it is likely that, upon examination, a state will take a position contrary to the position taken by the bancorp.
while it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the bancorps uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next twelve months, the bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during the next twelve months.

tax liability at both december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded deferred tax assets of $9 million, related to state net operating loss carryforwards. the deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses (primarily resulting from leasing operations) are presented net of specific valuation allowances of $27 million and $25 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. if these carryforwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying amounts through 2037. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded a deferred tax asset of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, related to a foreign tax credit carryforward. if not utilized, the deferred tax asset relating to the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2025.
the bancorp has determined that a valuation allowance is not needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 or 2016. the bancorp considered all of the positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and, based upon that evidence, the bancorp believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded at december 31, 2017 and 2016 will ultimately be realized. the bancorp reached this conclusion as the bancorp has taxable income in the carryback period and it is expected that the bancorps remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences and its projected future taxable income.
the irs has concluded its examination of the bancorps 2012 and 2013 federal income tax returns and is currently examining the bancorps 2014 federal income tax return. the statute of limitations for the bancorps federal income tax returns remains open for tax years 2012-2017. on occasion, as various state and local taxing jurisdictions examine the returns of the bancorp and its subsidiaries, the bancorp may agree to extend the statute of limitations for a reasonable period of time. otherwise, the statutes of limitations for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in accordance with each states statutes.
any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recognized $2 million and $1 million, respectively, of interest expense in connection with income taxes and an immaterial amount of interest benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp had accrued interest liabilities, net of the related tax benefits, of $3 million and $1 million, respectively. no material liabilities were recorded for penalties related to income taxes.
retained earnings at december 31, 2017 and 2016 included $157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. under current tax law, if certain of the bancorps subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at the current federal statutory corporate tax rate.

21. retirement and benefit plans the bancorps qualified defined benefit plans benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. the bancorps other retirement plans consist of non-qualified defined benefit plans which are frozen and funded on an as needed basis. a majority of these plans were obtained in acquisitions from prior years and are included with the qualified defined benefit plan in the following tables (the plan). the bancorp recognizes the overfunded and underfunded status of the plan as an asset and liability, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. the plan had an underfunded projected benefit obligation at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. the underfunded amounts recognized in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets were $24 million and $34 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the following table summarizes the plan as of and for the years ended december 31:

(a)                                         since the plans benefits are frozen, the rate of compensation increase is no longer an assumption used to calculate the accumulated benefit obligation. therefore, the accumulated benefit obligation was the same as the projected benefit obligation at both december 31, 2017 and 2016.

the estimated net actuarial loss for the plan that will be amortized from aoci into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is $7 million. the estimated net prior service cost for the plan that will be amortized from aoci into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
equity securities the plan measures common stock using quoted prices which are available in an active market and classifies these investments within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
mutual and exchange-traded funds all of the plans mutual and exchange-traded funds are publicly traded. the plan measures the value of these investments using the funds quoted prices which are available in an active market and classifies these investments within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. level 1 securities include money market funds, alternative strategies and commodity funds. where quoted prices are not available, the plan measures the fair value of these investments based on the redemption price of units held, which is based on the current fair value of the funds underlying assets. unit values are determined by dividing the funds net assets at fair value by its units outstanding at the valuation dates to obtain the investments net asset value. therefore, investments such as international funds, domestic funds, debt funds and alternative strategies are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
debt securities where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. level 1 securities include u.s. treasury securities. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or dcfs.
150  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements examples of such instruments, which are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities.
plan assumptions the plans assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as necessary. the discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a similar duration to the plans liabilities. the expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the assets invested to provide for the plans liabilities. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the bancorp evaluated actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate assumptions and broad equity and bond indices long-term return projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance.
the following table summarizes the weighted-average plan assumptions for the years ended december 31:
2017                     2016          2015
for measuring benefit obligations at year end:(a)
discount rate                                              3.47   %          3.97          4.16
expected return on plan assets                             6.00              7.00          7.00
for measuring net periodic benefit cost:(a)
discount rate                                              3.97              4.16          3.82
expected return on plan assets                             6.00              7.00          7.00
(a)            since the plans benefits were frozen, except for grandfathered employees, the rate of compensation increase is no longer applicable beginning in 2014 since minimal grandfathered employees are still accruing benefits.

lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2017 pension expense by approximately $1 million.
based on the actuarial assumptions, the bancorp expects to contribute $3 million to the plan in 2018. estimated pension benefit payments are $17 million for each of the years 2018 through 2022. the total estimated payments for the years 2023 through 2027 is $77 million.
investment policies and strategies the bancorps policy for the investment of plan assets is to employ investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target asset allocations relating to equity securities (including the bancorps common stock), fixed-income securities (including u.s. treasury and federal agencies securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and corporate bonds), alternative strategies (including traditional mutual funds, precious metals and commodities) and cash.
the following table provides the bancorps targeted and actual weighted-average asset allocations by asset category for the years ended december 31:

(b)   these reflect the targeted ranges for both the years ended december 31, 2017 and
2016.

the risk tolerance for the plan is determined by management to be moderate to aggressive, recognizing that higher returns involve some volatility and that periodic declines in the portfolios value are tolerated in an effort to achieve real capital growth. there were no significant concentrations of risk associated with the investments of the plan at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
permitted asset classes of the plan include cash and cash equivalents, fixed-income (domestic and non-u.s. bonds), equities (u.s., non-u.s., emerging markets and real estate investment trusts), equipment leasing, precious metals, commodity transactions and mortgages. the plan utilizes derivative instruments including puts, calls, straddles or other option strategies, as approved by management. per erisa, the bancorps common stock cannot exceed 10% of the fair value of plan assets.
fifth third bank, as trustee, is expected to manage plan assets in a manner consistent with the plan agreement and other regulatory, federal and state laws. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, $185 million and $172 million, respectively, of plan assets were managed by fifth third bank. the fifth third bank pension, 401(k) and medical plan committee (the committee) is the plan administrator. the trustee is required to provide to the committee monthly and quarterly reports covering a list of plan assets, portfolio performance, transactions and asset allocation. the trustee is also required to keep the committee apprised of any material changes in the trustees outlook and recommended investment policy. there were no fees paid by the plan for investment management, accounting or administrative services provided by the trustee. as of december 31, 2017, there was no bancorp common stock in plan assets. as of december 31, 2016, plan assets included $5 million of bancorp common stock, which was below the 10% erisa threshold previously discussed. plan assets are not expected to be returned to the bancorp during 2018.
other information on retirement and benefit plans the bancorp has a qualified defined contribution savings plan that allows participants to make voluntary 401(k) contributions on a pre-tax or roth basis, subject to statutory limitations. the bancorp amended and restated the qualified defined contribution savings plan in its entirety, effective as of january 1, 2015. beginning with the 2015 plan year, the bancorp provides a higher company 401(k) match contribution.
151  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements expenses recognized for matching contributions to the bancorps qualified defined contribution savings plan were $79 million, $75 million and $71 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the bancorp did not make profit sharing contributions during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. in addition, the bancorp has a non-qualified defined contribution plan that allows certain employees to make voluntary contributions into a deferred compensation plan. expenses recognized by the bancorp for its non-qualified defined contribution plan were $4 million for the year ended december, 31 2017 and $3 million for both of the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.

(a)           under the 2017 incentive compensation plan, 17.5 million shares were authorized for issuance as sars, rsas, rsus, stock options, performance share or unit awards, dividend or dividend equivalent rights and stock awards.

(b)            the number of shares to be issued upon exercise will be determined at exercise based on the difference between the grant price and the market price on the date of exercise and the calculation of taxes owed on the exercise.

(c)   the number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets and ranges from zero shares to approximately 2 million shares.

(d)                                               represents remaining shares of fifth third common stock under the bancorps 1993 stock purchase plan, as amended and restated, including an additional 1.5 million shares approved by shareholders on march 28, 2007 and an additional 12 million shares approved by shareholders on april 21, 2009.

stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the bancorps incentive compensation plan to executives, directors and key employees of the bancorp and its subsidiaries. the 2017 incentive compensation plan was approved by shareholders on april 18, 2017 and authorized the issuance of up to 6 million shares, in addition to the 11.5 million unused shares from the 2014 incentive compensation plan, as equity compensation and provides for sars, rsas, rsus, stock options, performance share or unit awards, dividend or dividend equivalent rights and stock awards. based on total stock-based awards outstanding (including sars, rsas, rsus, stock options and psas) and shares remaining for future grants under the 2017 incentive compensation plan, the potential dilution to which the bancorps shareholders of common stock are exposed due to the potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to executives, directors or key employees of the bancorp and its subsidiaries is 9%. sars, rsas, rsus, stock options and psas outstanding represent 6% of the bancorps issued shares at december 31, 2017.
all of the bancorps stock-based awards are to be settled with stock. the bancorp has historically used treasury stock to settle stock-based awards, when available. sars, issued at fair value based on the closing price of the bancorps common stock on the date of grant, have up to ten year terms and vest and become exercisable ratably over a three or four year period of continued employment. the bancorp does not grant discounted sars or stock options, re-price previously granted sars or stock options or grant reload stock options. rsas and rsus are released after three or four years or ratably over three or four years of continued employment. rsas include dividend and voting rights while rsus receive dividend equivalents only. stock options were previously issued at fair value based on the closing price of the bancorps common stock on the date of grant, had up to ten year terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three or four year period of continued employment. psas have three year cliff vesting terms with market conditions and/or performance conditions as defined by the plan. all of the bancorps executive stock-based awards contain an annual performance hurdle of 2% return on tangible common equity. if this threshold is not met in any one of the three years during the performance period, one-third of psas are forfeited. additionally, if this threshold is not met, all sars, rsas and rsus that would vest in the next year may also be forfeited at the discretion of the human capital and compensation committee of the board of directors. the bancorp met this threshold as of december 31, 2017.
156  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements stock-based compensation expense was $118 million, $111 million and $100 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in salaries, wages and incentives in the consolidated statements of income. the total related income tax benefit recognized was $41 million, $39 million and $36 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
stock appreciation rights the bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair value of each sar grant.
the weighted-average assumptions were as follows for the years ended december 31:
2017                 2016        2015
expected life (in years)           6               6           6
expected volatility               37   %          37          35
expected dividend yield          2.1             3.1         2.7
risk-free interest rate          2.1             1.5         1.6
the expected life is generally derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the amount of time that sars granted are expected to be outstanding. the expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities of the bancorps common stock. the expected dividend yield is based on annual dividends divided by the bancorps stock price. annual dividends are based on projected dividends, estimated using an expected long-term dividend payout ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the sars is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
the grant-date fair value of sars is measured using the black-
scholes option-pricing model. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of sars granted was $8.55, $5.16 and $5.52 per share for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the total grant-date fair value of sars that vested during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $29 million, $32 million and $35 million, respectively.
at december 31, 2017, there was $36 million of stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding sars not yet recognized. the expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated remaining weighted-average period at december 31, 2017 of 2.3 years.

stock options the grant-date fair value of stock options is measured using the black-scholes option-pricing model. there were no stock options granted during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was immaterial for both the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 and $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. cash received from stock options exercised was immaterial for the year ended december 31, 2017 and $1 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the tax benefit realized from exercised stock options was immaterial to the bancorps consolidated financial statements during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. all stock options were vested as of december 31, 2008, therefore, no stock options vested during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. as of december 31, 2017, the aggregate intrinsic value of both outstanding stock options and exercisable stock options was immaterial.

shares are excluded from the computation of earnings per diluted share when their inclusion has an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. the diluted earnings per share computation for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 excludes 4 million, 19 million and 16 million, respectively, of sars and an immaterial amount of stock options because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2017 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the december 19, 2017 accelerated share repurchase transaction. based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2017, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of december 31, 2017, and thus the impact of the forward contract related to the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2016 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the december 20, 2016 accelerated share repurchase transaction. based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2016, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of december 31, 2016, and thus the impact of the forward contract related to the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
the diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31, 2015 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the december 14, 2015 accelerated share repurchase transaction. based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the bancorps common stock during the fourth quarter of 2015, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of december 31, 2015, and thus the impact of the forward contract related to the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.

27. fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. u.s. gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the bancorp measures fair value, refer to note 1.

the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
available-for-sale and other securities and trading securities where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. level 1 securities include u.s. treasury securities and exchange-traded equities. if quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or dcfs. level 2 securities include federal agencies securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and equity securities. these securities are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.
residential mortgage loans held for sale for residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain arm loans, dcf models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions. the anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the arm margin. residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on external pricing for similar instruments. arm loans classified as held for sale are also classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the dcf model. these observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates.
residential mortgage loans residential mortgage loans held for sale that are reclassified to held for investment are transferred from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. it is the bancorps policy to value any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy based on end of period fair values.
163  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements for residential mortgage loans for which the fair value election has been made, and that are reclassified from held for sale to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. therefore, these loans are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. an adverse change in the loss rate or severity assumption would result in a decrease in fair value of the related loan. the secondary marketing department, which reports to the bancorps head of the consumer bank, in conjunction with the consumer credit risk department, which reports to the bancorps chief risk officer, are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for residential mortgage loans held for investment. the secondary marketing department reviews loss severity assumptions quarterly to determine if adjustments are necessary based on decreases in observable housing market data. this group also reviews trades in comparable benchmark securities and adjusts the values of loans as necessary. consumer credit risk is responsible for the credit component of the fair value which is based on internally developed loss rate models that take into account historical loss rates and loss severities based on underlying collateral values.
msrs effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected the fair value measurement method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights. msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, the bancorp estimates the fair value of msrs using internal oas models with certain unobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, oas and weighted-average lives, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. refer to note 12 for further information on the assumptions used in the valuation of the bancorps msrs. the secondary marketing department and treasury department are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for msrs. representatives from secondary marketing, treasury, accounting and risk management are responsible for reviewing key assumptions used in the internal oas model. two external valuations of the msr portfolio are obtained from third parties quarterly that use valuation models in order to assess the reasonableness of the internal oas model. additionally, the bancorp participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the msr valuation process and the resulting msr prices.
derivatives exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. most of the bancorps derivative contracts are valued using dcf or other models that incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps and options. derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, derivatives classified as level 3, which are valued using models containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of a total return swap associated with the bancorps sale of visa, inc. class b shares. level 3 derivatives also include irlcs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.
under the terms of the total return swap, the bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the visa, inc. class b shares into class a shares. additionally, the bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on visas stock price and the conversion rate of the visa, inc. class b shares into class a shares until the date on which the covered litigation is settled. the fair value of the total return swap was calculated using a dcf model based on unobservable inputs consisting of managements estimate of the probability of certain litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the covered litigation and visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the bancorps proportional share of escrow funds.
an increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the covered litigation would result in an increase in the fair value of the derivative liability; conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the covered litigation would result in a decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability. the accounting and treasury departments, both of which report to the bancorps chief financial officer, determined the valuation methodology for the total return swap. accounting and treasury review the changes in fair value on a quarterly basis for reasonableness based on visa stock price changes, litigation contingencies, and escrow funding.
the net asset fair value of the irlcs at december 31, 2017 was $8 million. immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in fair value of the irlcs of approximately $3 million and $7 million, respectively. immediate increases of current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases in fair value of the irlcs of approximately $4 million and $8 million, respectively. the decrease in fair value of irlcs due to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and the increase in fair value due to immediate 10% and 20% favorable changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear.
the consumer line of business finance department, which reports to the bancorps chief financial officer, and the aforementioned secondary marketing department are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for irlcs. secondary marketing, in conjunction with a third party valuation provider, periodically review loan closing rate assumptions and recent loan sales to determine if adjustments are needed for current market conditions not reflected in historical data.

to funds net asset value commercial loans held for sale during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp transferred $85 million and $140 million, respectively, of commercial loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at the lower of cost or fair value. these loans had fair value adjustments during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 totaling $31 million and $30 million, respectively, and were generally based on appraisals of the underlying collateral and were, therefore, classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. additionally, during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 there were fair value adjustments on existing loans held for sale of an immaterial amount and $2 million, respectively. the fair value adjustments were also based on appraisals of the underlying collateral. the bancorp recognized $2 million in losses on the sale of certain commercial loans held for sale during the year ended december 31, 2017 and an immaterial amount of net gains on the sale of certain commercial loans held for sale during the year ended december 31, 2016.
the accounting department determines the procedures for the valuation of commercial loans held for sale using appraised value which may include a comparison to recently executed transactions of similar type loans. a monthly review of the portfolio is performed for reasonableness. quarterly, appraisals approaching a year old are updated and the real estate valuation group, which reports to the bancorps chief risk officer, in conjunction with the commercial line of business, review the third party appraisals for reasonableness. additionally, the commercial line of business finance department, which reports to the bancorps chief financial officer, in conjunction with the accounting department reviews all loan appraisal values, carry values and vintages.
commercial loans and leases held for investment during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans, commercial construction loans and commercial leases held for investment. larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. when the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans were classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. the fair values and recognized impairment losses are reflected in the previous tables. commercial credit risk, which reports to the bancorps chief risk officer, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for commercial loans held for investment.
msrs effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected the fair value measurement method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights. the servicing rights were measured at fair value at december 31, 2017 and under the amortization method at december 31, 2016. mortgage interest rates increased during the year ended december 31, 2016 and the bancorp recognized a recovery of temporary impairment in certain classes of the msr portfolio and the carrying value was adjusted to fair value. refer to the msrs section of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis discussion for additional information.
oreo during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as oreo and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. these nonrecurring losses were primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties recorded in oreo. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, these losses include $4 million and $8 million, respectively, recorded as charge-offs, on new oreo properties transferred from loans during the respective periods and $6 million and $9 million, respectively, recorded as negative fair value adjustments on oreo in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income subsequent to their transfer from loans. as discussed in the following paragraphs, the fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. in cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. the previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the estimated costs to sell.
the real estate valuation department is solely responsible for managing the appraisal process and evaluating the appraisal for commercial properties transferred to oreo. all appraisals on commercial oreo properties are updated on at least an annual basis.
the real estate valuation department reviews the bpo data and internal market information to determine the initial charge-off on residential real estate loans transferred to oreo. once the foreclosure process is completed, the bancorp performs an interior inspection to update the initial fair value of the property.
168  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements these properties are reviewed at least every 30 days after the initial interior inspections are completed. the asset manager receives a monthly status report for each property which includes the number of showings, recently sold properties, current comparable listings and overall market conditions.
bank premises and equipment the bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. these properties were written down to their lower of cost or market values. at least annually thereafter, the bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. the fair value amounts were generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. corporate facilities, which reports to the bancorps chief administrative officer, in conjunction with accounting, are responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for bank premises and equipment. for further information on bank premises and equipment refer to note 7.
operating lease equipment during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain operating lease equipment. when evaluating whether an individual asset is impaired, the bancorp considers the current fair value of the asset, the changes in overall market demand for the asset and the rate of change in advancements associated with technological improvements that impact the demand for the specific asset under review. as part of this ongoing assessment, the bancorp determined that the carrying values of certain operating lease equipment were not recoverable and as a result, the bancorp recorded an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value. the fair value amounts were generally based on appraised values of the assets, resulting in a classification within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the bancorp recorded net losses of $42 million and $9 million, respectively, as a reduction to corporate banking revenue in the consolidated statements of income. the commercial leasing department, which reports to the bancorps chief operating officer, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for operating lease equipment. refer to note 8 for further information on impairment charges related to certain operating lease equipment.
private equity investments in december 2013, the u.s. banking agencies issued final rules to implement section 619 of the dfa, known as the volcker rule, which places limitations on banking organizations ability to own, sponsor or have certain relationships with certain private equity funds. the bancorp recognized $1 million and $9 million of otti primarily associated with certain nonconforming investments affected by the volcker rule during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the bancorp performed nonrecurring fair value measurements on a fund by fund basis to determine whether otti existed. the bancorp estimated the fair value of a fund by applying an estimated market discount to the reported net asset value of the fund. because the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is generally not certain, these funds were classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. an adverse change in the reported net asset values or estimated market discounts, where applicable, would result in a decrease in the fair value estimate. in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. the bancorps private equity department, which reports to the chief strategy officer, in conjunction with accounting, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates.
affordable housing investments during the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp recorded $68 million of nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain affordable housing investments. the impairment charges reflected the decline in value of the investments primarily due to the change in the federal statutory corporate tax rate pursuant to the tcja. the accounting department is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates. for further information on affordable housing investments refer to note 11.
169  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements fair value option the bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under u.s. gaap. electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. managements intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and maintained in the bancorps loan portfolio. in such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value.
fair value changes recognized in earnings for instruments held at december 31, 2017 and 2016 for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying irlcs, included gains of $14 million and $6 million, respectively. these gains are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the fair value of those loans by $2 million at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. interest on residential mortgage loans measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
the following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value as of:

cash and due from banks, other securities, other short-term investments, deposits, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings for financial instruments with a short-term or no stated maturity, prevailing market rates and limited credit risk, carrying amounts approximate fair value. those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, other securities consisting of fhlb, frb and dtcc restricted stock, other short-term investments, certain deposits (demand, interest checking, savings, money market, foreign office deposits and other deposits), federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings excluding fhlb borrowings. fair values for other time deposits, certificates of deposit $100,000 and over and fhlb borrowings were estimated using a dcf calculation that applies prevailing libor/swap interest rates and a spread for new issuances with similar terms.
held-to-maturity securities the bancorps held-to-maturity securities are primarily composed of instruments that provide income tax credits as the economic return on the investment. the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on current u.s. treasury tax credit rates.
171  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements loan and leases held for sale fair values for commercial loans and leases held for sale were valued based on executable bids when available, or on dcf models incorporating appraisals of the underlying collateral, as well as assumptions about investor return requirements and amounts and timing of expected cash flows. fair values for residential mortgage loans held for sale were valued based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales data from similar transactions. broker opinion statements were also obtained as additional evidence to support the third-party valuations.
portfolio loans and leases, net fair values were estimated based on either appraisals of the underlying collateral or by discounting future cash flows using the current market rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit characteristics, similar remaining maturities, prepayment speeds and loss severities. the bancorp estimates fair values at the transaction level whenever possible. for certain products with a large number of homogenous transactions, the bancorp employs a pool approach. this approach involves stratifying and sorting the entire population of transactions into a smaller number of pools with like characteristics. characteristics may include maturity date, coupon, origination date and principal amortization method.
long-term debt fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, when available, or a dcf calculation using libor/swap interest rates and, in some cases, fifth third credit and/or debt instrument spreads for new issuances with similar terms.

28. regulatory capital requirements and capital ratios the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bhc and in analyzing applications to it under the bhca of 1956, as amended. these guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. the regulatory capital requirements were revised by the basel iii final rule which was effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of its components and other provisions. it established quantitative measures defining minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the measure of well-capitalized
status. additionally, the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued similar guidelines for minimum regulatory capital requirements and well-capitalized measurements for banking subsidiaries.
quarterly average assets are a component of the tier i leverage ratio and for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and other investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier i capital.

failure to meet the minimum capital requirements or falling below the well-capitalized measure can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the bancorp. additionally, when fully phased-in in 2019, the basel iii final rule will include a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements of the cet1, tier i capital and total risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
the bancorp and its banking subsidiary, fifth third bank, had cet1 capital, tier i risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and tier i leverage ratios above the well-capitalized levels at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. to continue to qualify for financial holding company status pursuant to the gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999, the bancorps banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain well-capitalized capital ratios. in addition, the bancorp exceeded the capital conservation buffer ratio for all periods presented.

175  fifth third bancorp notes to consolidated financial statements
30. business segments the bancorp reports on four business segments: commercial banking, branch banking, consumer lending and wealth and asset management. results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change.
the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. by employing an ftp methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. the ftp methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other. the charge rates and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve, which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. the ftp curve is constructed using the u.s. swap curve, brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing.
the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge rates and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. the credit rates for several deposit products were reset january 1, 2017 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. these rates were generally higher than those in place during 2016, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2017. ftp charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. as overall market rates increased, the ftp charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2017.
the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for loan and lease losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. provision for loan and lease losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other. the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.
the following is a description of each of the bancorps business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.
commercial banking offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers. in addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, commercial banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance.
branch banking provides a full range of deposit and loan and lease products to individuals and small businesses through 1,154 full-service banking centers. branch banking offers depository and loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobiles and other personal financing needs, as well as products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services.
consumer lending includes the bancorps residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other indirect lending activities. direct lending activities include the origination, retention and servicing of residential mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and securitizations of those loans, pools of loans or lines of credit, and all associated hedging activities. indirect lending activities include extending loans to consumers through correspondent lenders and automobile dealers.
wealth and asset management provides a full range of investment alternatives for individuals, companies and not-for-profit organizations. wealth and asset management is made up of five main businesses: fts, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the bancorp; cleararc capital, inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the bancorp; fifth third insurance agency, inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the bancorp; fifth third private bank; and fifth third institutional services. fts offers full service retail brokerage services to individual clients and broker-dealer services to the institutional marketplace. cleararc capital, inc. provides asset management services. fifth third insurance agency, inc. assists clients with their financial and risk management needs. fifth third private bank offers holistic strategies to affluent clients in wealth planning, investing, insurance and wealth protection. fifth third institutional services provides advisory services for institutional clients including states and municipalities.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. we operate in two distinct business segments: fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium. our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.
2017 highlights the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31, 2017:
•   on november 1, 2017, we successfully completed the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business which was a significant milestone and transformed fmc into a tier-one leader and the fifth largest global provider in the agricultural chemicals market. this acquisition brought greater scale and regional balance to our business, improved our market access and expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline significantly. on november 1, 2017, we completed the previously disclosed sale of our fmc health and nutrition business to dupont. the sale resulted in a gain of approximately $918 million ($727 million, net of tax).
•   revenue of $2,878.6 million in 2017 increased $339.7 million or approximately 13 percent versus last year. a more detailed review of revenues by segment is included under the section entitled "results of operations". on a regional basis, sales in north america increased 14 percent, sales in asia increased 21 percent and sales in europe, middle east and africa (emea) increased by 5 percent and sales in latin america increased by 14 percent.
•   our gross margin, excluding acquisition-related charges, of $1,121.5 million increased approximately $190.3 million or approximately 20 percent versus last year. gross margin as a percent of revenue is approximately 39 percent versus 37 percent in 2016. the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved pricing and mix in our fmc lithium business as well as the sale of higher margin products from the acquired dupont crop protection business.
•   selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35 percent from $458.5 million to $618.6 million. the change is primarily due to acquisition-related charges incurred in 2017 related to the dupont crop protection business acquisition which was $130.2 million of the increase. selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges, of $470.2 million increased $58.5 million or approximately 14 percent. non-operating pension and postretirement charges and acquisition-related charges are presented in our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".
•   research and development expenses of $141.5 million increased $7.0 million or 5 percent. the increase was due to investments in discovery and product development from the newly acquired state of the art facilities from the dupont crop protection business acquisition.
•   net income attributable to fmc stockholders of $535.8 million increased approximately $326.7 million from $209.1 million in the prior year period primarily due to the gain on sale of our discontinued fmc health and nutrition of approximately $727 million, net of tax. the increase was partially offset by a provisional income tax charge of $315.9 million related to the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"). adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders of $368.3 million increased approximately $110.6 million or 43 percent due to higher results in fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium. see the disclosure of our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".
other 2017 highlights in fmc lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to grow our business in the technology-driven specialty end markets, where demand continues to accelerate and pricing trends across our portfolio remain favorable. in march, we announced our intention to separate fmc lithium into a publicly traded company during 2018. in june, we started commercial sales from our new lithium hydroxide facility in china. we expanded production of lithium carbonate at our argentina site through debottlenecking projects, and we also announced plans to more than double lithium carbonate production at that same site to at least 40,000 metric tons by 2022.
18
on august 1, 2017, we completed the sale of the omega-3 business to pelagia as for $38 million.
in may 2017, we entered into a new $1.5 billion term loan facility to fund the transaction agreement with dupont.we also entered into an amended and restated $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and amended the existing term loan facility at that time. among other things, the amendments temporarily increased the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant in order to permit the debt incurred under the contemplated new term loan facility along with certain other changes to permit the expected transaction.
2018 outlook we believe the crop protection chemical market will be flat to up low single digits and we believe that the lithium market will continue to see significant demand growth in 2018. we believe that our 2018 plan is very achievable, as it relies on things we control rather than on expectations of positive external events.
we expect to deliver segment revenue and earnings growth in each business. in fmc agricultural solutions, we will focus on the integration of the dupont crop protection business and on creating a stronger combined business to capitalize on the products and expertise of these two former organizations. we expect to outperform the crop protection market in 2018, owing to our recently acquired products and to our proactive competitive positioning of our legacy business. we believe that fmc lithium will increase earnings significantly through volume and price increases in 2018.
on a long-term basis, we are a technology-driven company with low-cost operations, a world class research and development organization that balances short-and mid-term developments with long-term innovations, and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers.
please see segment discussions under the section entitled "results of operations" for 2018 outlook for each segment.

(2)   our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. these costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. we exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. we continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above. we believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees. these expenses are included as a component of the line item "selling, general and administrative expenses" on the consolidated statements of income (loss).
(3)   charges relate to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting, transaction costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs, integration related legal and professional third-party fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the acquisitions. amounts represent the following:

adjusted earnings reconciliation the following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). these items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. these after-tax items are discussed in detail within the "other results of operations" section that follows. additionally, the chart below discloses our non-gaap financial measure "adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders" reconciled from the gaap financial measure "net income (loss) attributable to fmc stockholders." we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors. we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, certain non-gaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap.

(1)   the income tax expense (benefit) on corporate special charges (income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) based on the nature of the non-gaap performance measure.
(2)   we exclude the gaap tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-gaap measure of income, and instead include a non-gaap tax provision based upon the annual non-gaap effective tax rate. the gaap tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law which includes the impact of the act enacted on december 22, 2017. management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmc's operational performance.

in the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled "segment results reconciliation" within the results of operations section. all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted.
segment results for management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") and research and development expenses ("r&d"). we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), non-operating pension and postretirement charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory adjustments, acquisition/divestiture related charges, business separation costs and other income and expense items.
information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
beginning in 2018 we will present earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") by operating segment, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we define segment ebitda as segment operating profit excluding depreciation and amortization expense. we believe that this non-gaap financial measure provides a useful metric for management and investors to better assess operating performance and enables transparency to investors and analysts for period-to-period comparability of financial performance. due to the recent dupont crop protection business acquisition, we acquired a large number of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. the depreciation and amortization on the intangible assets is expected to significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.

2017 vs. 2016
revenue of $2,531.2 million increased approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period. higher volumes contributed 12 percent to the increase while favorable foreign currency had an impact of 1 percent. the acquired dupont crop protection business contributed 8 percent to these higher volumes, or approximately $193 million. these increases were partially offset by lower pricing which impacted revenue by 2 percent.
operating profit of $485.6 million increased approximately 21 percent compared to the year-ago period. the higher volumes discussed above impacted the change in operating profit by 43 percent and favorable foreign currency impacted the change in operating profit by 5 percent. the acquired business represented a majority of these higher volumes. offsetting these increases were lower pricing which had an unfavorable impact of 11 percent as well as higher costs which unfavorably impacted the segment by 16 percent to the increase. the higher costs were also due to the recently acquired business.
for 2018, full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $3.95 billion to $4.15 billion and full-year segment ebitda is expected to be approximately $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. full-year depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $145 million. we anticipate legacy fmc agricultural solutions revenue will grow 2 to 4 percent, while the acquired business is expected to grow by 6 to 10 percent.

revenue of $2,274.8 million decreased approximately 13 percent versus pro forma combined revenue the prior year period. volumes contributed to 14 percent of the decline and unfavorable foreign currency contributed another one percent to the decline. these declines were partially offset by favorable pricing which contributed a 2 percent increase. the lower volumes were partially due to actions we took to eliminate certain product sales in latin america. refer to the chart below for discussion on revenue by region. these actions reduced revenue by approximately $175 million compared to the pro forma revenue for 2015.
operating profit of $399.9 million increased approximately 4 percent compared to the pro forma combined operating profit for the prior period. improved pricing and mix impacted pro forma operating profit by 10 percent which was predominantly experienced in both brazil and north america and favorable foreign currency impacted pro forma results by 4 percent. lower costs, primarily selling, general and administrative in nature also favorably impacted results by 10 percent. the lower volumes noted above had a negative impact on pro forma operating profit of 20 percent.

(2)   increase in the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was driven by strong sales in france as we moved to direct market access. additionally, favorable pricing and new product launches in cereal herbicides and fungicides contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by a late start to the season in northwestern europe in the first quarter of 2017.
(3)   increase in the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was driven by strong demand for both pre- and post-emergent herbicides, as well as foliar insecticides.
(4)   increase for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was driven by growth in soybean applications in brazil, as well as increased insecticide volumes in argentina and mexico. additionally, successful product launches contributed to the revenue increase.
(5)   the increase in the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to successful product launches in china, strong demand for rice insecticides in indonesia and increased herbicide demand in australia.
actual results for 2016 vs. pro forma combined results for 2015
(6)   decrease in the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was driven by unfavorable weather in both central and western europe. additionally, the shift in the timing of sales as a result of our change to a direct market access model across europe and product rationalization each contributed to the decline in revenue.
(7)   decrease in the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was driven by elevated channel inventory levels and lower demand due to the deterioration in farm incomes which resulted in more cautious purchasing decisions.
(8)   lower sales volumes in brazil contributed to the reduction in revenue for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. continued product rationalization resulted in lower revenues as well as the decision to allow the existing channel inventory to reduce. the volumes were also impacted by our disciplined approach to reduce our credit exposure in brazil. additionally, foreign exchange headwinds from the mexican peso contributed to the revenue decrease.
(9)   decline in the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was driven by softer demand in china as well as our actions to reduce channel inventories in india, following two years of drought.

2017 vs. 2016
revenue of $347.4 million increased by approximately 32 percent versus the prior-year period driven by improved pricing and mix, which accounted for a 23 percent increase. additionally, higher volumes impacted revenue by 9 percent. foreign currency had a minimal impact on the change in revenue.
segment operating profit of $126.7 million increased approximately $57 million versus the year ago period. the improved pricing and mix noted above impacted operating profit by approximately $60 million while volume contributed to the change by $11 million. these increases were offset by higher raw material prices and energy prices as well as expansion related costs by approximately $13 million. foreign currency had a negative impact of less than $1 million on the change in operating profit.
full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $420 million to $460 million for 2018 and full-year segment ebitda is expected to be approximately $180 million to $200 million. full-year depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $20 million.
2016 vs. 2015
revenue of $264.1 million increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prior-year period driven by favorable pricing of carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide, which accounted for 14 percent of the change. this was offset by lower volumes due to increased demand from downstream products, which impacted revenues by 3 percent.
segment operating profit of $70.2 million increased approximately $47 million versus the year ago period. the favorable pricing noted above impacted operating profit by approximately $33 million while volume had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million. favorable foreign currency impacts increased operating profit by approximately $3 million. additionally, lower raw material prices, lower energy prices and increased manufacturing efficiencies improved operating profit by approximately $14 million.

corporate and other corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item "selling, general and administrative expenses" except for last in, first-out (lifo) related charges that are included as a component of "cost of sales and other services" on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
2017 vs. 2016
corporate and other expenses of $102.4 million increased by $17.8 million from $84.6 million in 2016. the increase was driven by approximately $6 million of corporate incentives due to higher business results and share-based compensation. additionally, the prior period included approximately $7 million of lifo income that did not recur in 2017. the remaining increase was due to other corporate items including corporate facility costs, foreign exchange losses and other shared corporate costs.
2016 vs. 2015
corporate and other expenses of $84.6 million increased by $21.6 million from $63.0 million in the same period in 2015. approximately $10 million of the increase is driven by the higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance as well as costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters which totaled approximately $2 million. the remaining $9 million increase was primarily the result of other project initiatives.
interest expense, net
2017 vs. 2016
interest expense, net of $79.1 million increased by approximately 26 percent compared to $62.9 million in 2016. the increase was driven by the impacts of higher foreign debt balances of approximately $6 million, the addition of the 2017 term loan facility of $6 million, and increases in interest rates of approximately $4 million.
2016 vs. 2015
interest expense, net of $62.9 million increased by 3 percent as compared to $60.9 million in 2015. the slight increase was due to higher foreign debt balances, partially offset by lower term balance and other minor factors.

2017
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2017 were primarily associated with charges in our fmc lithium segment of $7.8 million related to miscellaneous restructuring. there were also impairment charges of intangible assets within fmc agricultural solutions of $2.2 million. in corporate, there were asset write-downs of approximately $5.5 million. amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges of $0.8 million.
other charges (income), net in 2017 consisted of a $42.1 million impairment on certain indefinite-lived intangible assets from the acquired dupont crop protection business acquisition as a result of a triggering event due to the act. other charges (income) also includes $16.6 million for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges. additionally, we incurred exit costs of $4.8 million resulting from the termination and de-consolidation of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and was part of our fmc agricultural solutions segment. we had other miscellaneous charges, net of approximately $1.6 million.
2016

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2016 totaled $43.4 million. included in this were final charges totaling $42.3 million associated with the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment. this amount included final adjustments to severances, long lived asset write offs, contract termination costs and other miscellaneous items. there were miscellaneous restructuring charges of $1.1 million.
other charges (income), net in 2016 consisted of $36.8 million for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges, $13.2 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development and $4.2 million as a result of the argentina government's action to devalue its currency. these charges were offset by other miscellaneous income of $2.6 million.
2015
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2015 totaled $124.0 million. included in this were significant charges totaling $118.3 million associated with charges as part of the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment. the cheminova charges included those associated with the sale of consagro, which amounted to $64.5 million. there were other miscellaneous restructuring charges in both fmc agricultural solutions and corporate of $5.7 million.
other charges (income), net in 2015 consisted of environmental charges of $21.7 million, the impacts of the argentina currency devaluation in december of 2015 of $10.7 million, and $20.5 million of expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development activity. partially offsetting these amounts was a gain of $26.6 million related to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a belgian-based pesticide distribution company, belchim crop protection n.v. ("belchim").
non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income are included in "selling, general and administrative expenses" on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
2017 vs. 2016
the charge for 2017 was $18.2 million compared to $23.4 million in 2016. the decrease was the result of $22.8 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses as a result of a change in estimate in fiscal 2017 to amortize the gains and losses over the expected life time of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants which was partially offset by an increase of $15.4 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements. see note 13 for more information.
2016 vs. 2015
the charge for 2016 was $23.4 million compared to $29.8 million in 2015. the decrease in charges was in part due to the estimation method used in 2016 to calculate the interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost as described in the critical accounting policies section of item 7 within this form 10-k. the decrease was also the result of $15.1 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $17.7 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements. see note 13 for more information.
acquisition-related charges a detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the "results of operations" section of the management's discussion and analysis.
provision for income taxes a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries (e.g. denmark, singapore and hong kong), which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate. our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued. as a result of the act, we currently estimate our effect tax rate for 2018 will increase by low single digits as a result of a minimum tax on overseas income, combined with a restriction on the use of foreign tax credits to offset this additional tax. in foreign jurisdictions, with a tax rate outside the u.s. of less than around 13 percent, we will have an additional u.s. tax bill under the gilti provisions of the act.
provision for income taxes for 2017 was expense of $264.1 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 146.1 percent primarily attributable to the $315.9 million of provisional tax expense associated with the act. provision for income taxes for 2016 was
26
expense of $50.1 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.7 percent and provision for income taxes for 2015 was $5.2 million resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 2.5 percent. during 2015, our fmc agricultural solutions business in brazil experienced significant current and cumulative losses driven by unfavorable market conditions. as of december 31, 2016, sufficient positive evidence to realize the net deferred tax assets in brazil was not available and a full valuation allowance against those assets remains established. note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and year-over-year changes. we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to non-gaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business.

_______________
(1)   tax adjustments in 2017 were primarily associated with the provisional income tax expense recorded as a result of the enactment of the act in december 2017. see note 11 for additional discussion. tax adjustments in 2016 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments to u.s. state deferred tax balances. tax adjustments in 2015 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments taken in our brazil subsidiaries.
the primary drivers for the decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate for 2017 compared to 2016 are shown in the table above. the remaining change was due to reduced domestic earnings in our fmc agricultural solutions business and the impact of the full integration of cheminova into our global supply chain.
discontinued operations, net of income taxes our discontinued operations, in periods up to its sale, represent our discontinued fmc health and nutrition and fmc alkali chemicals business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations. the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations.
2017 vs. 2016
discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented income of $621.7 million in 2017 compared to income of $81.0 million in 2016. the increase was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $727 million. amount also includes the impairment charge of approximately $148 million, net of tax to write down our omega-3 business to its sales price.
2016 vs. 2015
discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented income of $81.0 million in 2016 compared to income of $711.1 million in 2015. the change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division which resulted in an after-tax gain of $702.1 million in 2015.
net income attributable to fmc stockholders
2017 vs. 2016
net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to $535.8 million from $209.1 million. the increase was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes as discussed above, offset by the impacts of u.s. tax reform and increases in acquisition-related charges. refer to note 11 to these consolidated financial statements.
2016 vs. 2015
net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to $209.1 million from $489.0 million. the decrease was primarily due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division in 2015 which was partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs in 2016.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2017 and 2016, were $283.0 million and $64.2 million, respectively. of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2017, $97.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the act, we recognized a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the remeasurement of the company's u.s. net deferred tax asset. see note 11 to these consolidated financial statements for more information. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operating activities and future foreign investments. we have not provided additional income taxes for any additional outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries because the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable or in process and not yet complete. we are still in the process of analyzing the impact of the act on our indefinite reinvestment assertion.
at december 31, 2017, we had total debt of $3,185.6 million as compared to $1,893.0 million at december 31, 2016. total debt included $2,993.0 million and $1,798.8 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $101.2 million and $2.4 million) at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details. following the dupont crop protection business acquisition, the maximum leverage ratio temporarily stepped up to 4.75 from 3.5 and will step down to 4.5 in accordance with the provisions of the credit facility and the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities in the third quarter of 2018. we will take a variety of steps, if necessary, to ensure compliance with the maximum leverage ratio at the applicable measurement dates.
on november 1, 2017, we borrowed $1.5 billion under our previously announced senior unsecured term loan facility to finance the dupont crop protection business acquisition. $1.2 billion was used to fund a cash payment to dupont. the remaining $300 million will be used to pay various obligations related to the transaction, including taxes payable on the gain from the sale of fmc health and nutrition. see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details.
the increase in long-term debt was due to the drawing down of funds under the 2017 term loan facility and increased foreign debt balances, which were partially offset by prepayments of the 2014 term loan facility. at december 31, 2017, $450.0 million and $1,500.0 million remained outstanding under the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities, respectively. the scheduled maturities of the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities are on april 21, 2020 and november 1, 2022, respectively. the borrowings under the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities.
our short-term debt, which consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program. foreign borrowings increased from $85.5 million at december 31, 2016 to $91.4 million at december 31, 2017 while outstanding commercial paper decreased $6.3 million.
our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility. at december 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under the commercial paper program.

____________________
(1)   represents the sum of corporate special charges and depreciation and amortization.
(2)   the changes in cash flows related to trade receivables in 2017 and 2016 were primarily driven by timing of collections. note, that approximately $213 million of the change in receivables for 2017 was due to receivable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any receivables as part of the transaction. collection timing is more pronounced in our fmc agricultural solutions business where sales, particularly in brazil, can have a longer collection period. additionally, timing of collection is impacted as amounts for both periods include carry-over balances remaining to be collected in latin america, where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks. during 2017, we collected approximately $848 million of receivables in brazil. a significant proportion of the collections in brazil are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivable balance.
(3)   changes in inventory are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions mostly in fmc agricultural solutions.
(4)   the change in cash flows related to accounts payable is primarily driven by the timing of payments made to suppliers and vendors. note that approximately $191 million of the change in payables for 2017 was due to payable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any payables as part of the transaction. the change in accounts payable in 2015 was also attributable to inventory reduction activities across the company particularly as we integrated cheminova as well as adjusting inventory levels in light of market conditions at the time. these events did not repeat in 2016.
(5)   these rebates are associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment in north america and brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year. the changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in 2017 compared to 2016 and timing of rebate payments.
(6)   the advance payments from customers represent advances from our fmc agricultural solutions segment customers. revenue associated with advance payments is recognized, generally in the first quarter of each year, as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. approximately $85 million of the change for 2017 was attributable to the acquired dupont crop protection business.
(7)   changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities, including guarantees issued to vendors under our vendor finance program.
(8)   see note 7 in our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details.

(9)   included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation at our operating sites of $16.6 million, $36.8 million and $21.7 million, respectively. the amounts in 2017 will be spent in future years. the amounts represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves, net of recoveries. environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations.
(10)   amounts include voluntary contributions to our u.s. qualified defined benefit plan of $44.0 million, $35.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively.
(11)   interest payments increased through the year primarily due to higher foreign debt balances, the addition of the 2017 term loan facility, and increases in interest rates.
(12)   tax payments in 2015 primarily represent the tax paid on the gain associated with the sale of the discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division.
(13)   amounts are presented as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows in 2016 and 2015, from share-based compensation.
(14)   represents payments for the cheminova purchase price hedges. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
(15)   2017 activity represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition. acquisitions. 2016 and 2015 activity represents payments for legal an professional fees associated with the cheminova acquisition. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
cash provided (required) by operating activities of discontinued operations was $21.0 million, $128.9 million and $113.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash required by operating activities of discontinued operation is directly related to environmental, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities.
amounts in 2017 and 2015 included divestiture costs associated with the sale of our fmc health and nutrition and fmc alkali chemicals business as well as related operating activities.
cash provided (required) by investing activities of continuing operations was $(1,349.5) million, $(100.8) million and $(1,230.4) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the changes in cash required by investing activities are primarily due to the acquisitions of the dupont crop protection business in 2017 and cheminova in 2015.
cash provided (required) by investing activities of discontinued operations was $15.7 million, $(34.4) million and $1,579.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2017 includes the cash proceeds from the sale of the omega-3 business for $38.0 million while the amount in 2015 includes the proceeds of $1.65 billion from sale of our fmc alkali chemicals business.
cash provided (required) by financing activities was $1,213.1 million, $(377.0) million and $(16.7) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the change in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 primarily related to the increase in proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt, partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt during the year.
the change in cash required by financing activities in 2016 primarily related to repayments of borrowings under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds.
2018 outlook in 2018, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation. in aggregate, we expect cash basis operating income to increase driven by significantly higher earnings within each segment, including a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business acquisition partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2018.
other potential liquidity needs our cash needs for 2018 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and costs associated with acquisition-related charges as well as costs to integrate the dupont crop protection business into fmc agricultural solutions. we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations, commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2017 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $1,354.0 million.
30
projected 2018 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to increase to approximately $250 million primarily driven by the lithium expansion as well as expenditures from the recently acquired dupont crop protection business. additionally, we will incur corporate level spending associated with the two year implementation of a new sap system.
projected 2018 spending includes approximately $60 to $65 million of net environmental remediation spending. this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of "costs of sales and services" in our consolidated statements of income (loss) since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections.
as a result of the act, we will have to pay a transition tax of $202.7 million which is payable over the next eight years.
our u.s. pension plan assets decreased slightly from $1,203.3 million at december 31, 2016 to $1,334.9 million at december 31, 2017. our u.s. pension plan assets comprise approximately all of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. we made contributions of $44.0 million and $35.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and intend to contribute $30 million in 2018. our contributions in 2016, 2017 and our intended contribution in 2018 are all in excess of the minimum requirements. our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc") premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility. in 2017, we changed our u.s. qualified pension plan's investment strategy to a liability hedging approach with an objective of minimizing funded status volatility. as a result, we expect lower contributions in future periods. while we do not believe that the contribution in 2018 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs, the volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, no shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program. at december 31, 2017, $238.8 million remained unused under our board-authorized repurchase program. this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans.
dividends on january 18, 2018, we paid dividends aggregating $22.3 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31, 2017. this amount is included in "accrued and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2017. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid $88.8 million, $88.6 million and $86.4 million in dividends, respectively.
commitments we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers, principally brazilian customers, for their seasonal borrowing. the total of these guarantees was $58.4 million at december 31, 2017. these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely.
short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31, 2017 and foreign credit lines and commercial paper december 31, 2016. we provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries.
in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss, no specific liability has been recorded. if triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. in cases where it is possible, we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations. refer to note 9 for further details.
our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows:

(1)   excluding discounts.
(2)   contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. we had $1,974.3 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at december 31, 2017. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31, 2017. variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time.
(3)   obligations associated with operating leases, before sub-lease rental income.
(4)   obligations associated with our ewing, nj and shanghai, china research and technology centers.
(5)   derivative contracts were in a net asset position as of december 31, 2017. see note 17. as a result, they are excluded from the table above.
(6)   purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts.
(7)   as of december 31, 2017, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $93.9 million. this liability is excluded from the table above. additionally, accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. also excluded from the table above is the liability attributable to the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings incurred as a result of the act of $202.7 million.
contingencies see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
climate change as a global corporate citizen, we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas (ghg) emissions to the atmosphere.
fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts. we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and ghg intensity for our operations by 15 percent from our 2013 baseline year. to date, our fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium segments have reduced energy use by 13 percent and 16 percent and ghg intensity by 4 percent and 19 percent, respectively. fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp (formerly carbon disclosure project) since 2016. fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports.
even as we take action to control the release of ghgs, additional warming is anticipated. long-term, higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources, growing seasons, precipitation patterns, weather patterns, species distributions, water availability, sea levels, and biodiversity. these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc's production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs. depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources, fmc's customers could be impacted. demand for fmc's products could increase if our products meet our customers' needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs. within our own operations, we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change. we are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken. to lessen fmc's overall environmental footprint, we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites. we have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in high-risk areas by 20

percent and our waste intensities by 15 percent. to date, fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium have reduced our water use in high risk areas by 21 percent and 13 percent and our waste disposal intensity by 20 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
in our product portfolio, we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts. for example, fmc agricultural solutions' products can help customers increase yield, energy and water efficiency, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops. fmc lithium's products can be used in energy storage applications, fuel-efficient and electric vehicles, lighter-weight aluminum in the aircraft and aerospace industries.
we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change. agricultural solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products. fmc lithium is researching new applications of our lithium products in a range of industries. these business opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers. beyond our products and operations, fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs. therefore, we will actively work with our entire value chain - suppliers, contractors, and customers - to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions.
we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. in december 2015, 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs. it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement. the united states is a signatory to the paris agreement, but on june 1, 2017, president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and on august 4, 2017, the united states delivered notice of its intention to withdraw to united nations. on october 16, 2017, the united states environmental protection agency (epa) filed notice of a rulemaking to repeal the lean power plan. epa followed this action with the issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the proper roles of the state and federal government in regulating emissions from electric power plants, and also seeking information on technologies and strategies for reducing emissions from existing plants.
notwithstanding the united states' withdrawal from the paris agreement, will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module. fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all of our facilities around the world.
some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation, such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme. at present, that plant's emissions are below its designated cap.
during 2018 we will be assessing the ghg impact of our facilities acquired from dupont and will adjust our disclosures and targets accordingly.
future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy, additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment, and/or costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes. we are currently monitoring regulatory developments. the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we have described our accounting policies in note 1 "principal accounting policies and related financial information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. we have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors. critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with u.s. gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.
revenue recognition and trade receivables we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which is generally upon transfer of title. this transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer. in all cases, we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms.
we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers, primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment, and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as "advance payments from customers" on the consolidated balance sheet. revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer.
we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services. amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.
trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized. the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. in developing our allowance for trade receivables, we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions.
our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly.
we also hold long-term receivables that represent long-term customer receivable balances related to past-due accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year. our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables. therefore on an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our long-term receivables utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and write-offs, as well as existing economic conditions, to determine if an additional allowance is necessary.
on january 1, 2018, accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, became effective. see note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for more information.
environmental obligations and related recoveries we provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency ("epa"), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision ("rod"), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a remedial investigation/feasibility study ("ri/fs"), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate
34
government agency or agencies. estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. such costs principally include, among other items, ri/fs, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants' engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.
included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (om&m). such reserves are based on our best estimates for these om&m plans. over time we may incur om&m costs in excess of these reserves. however, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such om&m plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. such additional om&m costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years.
included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery.
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties ("prps") or other third parties. such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla") and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible. we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects. recoveries are recorded as either an offset in "environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued" or as "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with u.s. accounting literature.
see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations.
impairments and valuation of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time.
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those
35
assets. in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices. based on our assessment for 2017, we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required. the majority of the brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value. during the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a $1 million impairment charge in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the fmc agricultural solutions segment. the carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately $4 million. separately, as a result of the act we performed an impairment assessment on the recently acquired brand portfolio and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $42 million solely due to the new tax legislation. see note 11 for more details.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves.
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. the costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. the costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. to the extent our plans' actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans' demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans' funding requirements, could increase or decrease. when actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. in addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods.
historically, we have amortized unrecognized gains and losses using the corridor method over the average remaining service period of active participants of approximately eight years. as of january 1, 2017, approximately 95% of the participants in our u.s. qualified plan and approximately 93% of the participants in our u.s. postretirement life plan were inactive. therefore, for fiscal 2017, we amortized gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive population for these two plans. the gain/loss amortization period for the u.s. qualified pension plan increased from about eight years to about nineteen years as a result of this change. we consider this a change in estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2017. for fiscal 2017, the change in estimate from amortizing gains and losses over the expected lifetime of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of active participants reduced us pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by approximately $20 million when compared to the prior estimate.
we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans' funding requirements. the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans' funding requirements. the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly.
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. in selecting a discount rate as of december 31, 2017, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary. this yield-curve, when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced an effective discount rate of 3.68 percent for our u.s. qualified plan, 3.29 percent for our u.s. nonqualified, and 3.41 percent for our u.s. other postretirement benefit plans.
the discount rates used at our december 31, 2017 and 2016 measurement dates for the u.s. qualified plan were 3.68 percent and 4.22 percent, respectively. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.22 percent to 3.68 percent at december 31, 2017 resulted in a $77.5 million increase to our u.s. qualified pension benefit obligations. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.50 percent at december 31, 2015 to 4.22 percent at december 31, 2016 resulted in a $0.3 million increase to the 2017 u.s. qualified pension expense.
the change in discount rate from 4.22 percent at december 31, 2016 to 3.68 percent at december 31, 2017 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2016 and 2017 measurement dates. using the december 31, 2017 and 2016 yield curves, our u.s. qualified plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 3.68 percent and 4.22 percent, respectively.
36
in developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our u.s. plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. we also consider the historical performance of our own plan's trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 7.9 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our long-term rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 6.50 percent, 7.00 percent and 7.25 percent, respectively.
on december 31, 2015, we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension plans. we use a full yield curve approach in the estimate of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs.
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below.
sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $73.6 million and $70.3 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $0.4 million, $5.2 million and $6.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $81.3 million and, $78.5 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by $0.4 million, $5.7 million and $6.5 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $6.0 million, $6.0 million and $5.8 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $6.0 million, $6.0 million and $5.8 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. in assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
additionally, we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the u.s. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. we adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.
on december 22, 2017, the act was enacted in the united states. the act reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.
as of december 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act, however, as described further in note 11, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes.

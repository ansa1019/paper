item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our base business calculations, see the results of operations section below.
2017 financial overview financial results we generated strong results in 2017, on top of excellent performance and favorable weather last year. we produced sales growth of 8% in 2017 on top of sales growth of 9% in 2016 and converted this into solid earnings growth, primarily due to executing our strategies in pursuit of our mission every day.
net sales increased 8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. pool remodeling, equipment replacement and the expansion of building materials and commercial products were the major contributors to base business sales growth of 7% for the year. gross profit increased 9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) grew 10 basis points to 28.9% for 2017 compared to 28.8% in 2016.
selling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased 7% compared to 2016, with base business operating expenses up 5% over last year. the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growth-driven labor and freight expenses, as well as greater employee benefit costs, equity-based compensation, and technology spending. as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses declined 20 basis points.
operating income for the year increased 11% to $284.4 million, up from $255.9 million in 2016. operating income as a percentage of net sales (operating margin) increased to 10.2% in 2017 compared to 10.0% in 2016.
our provision for income taxes for 2017 was impacted by both u.s. tax reform and accounting standards update (asu) 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which primarily reflects the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability. in addition to the impact from tax reform, we recorded a $12.6 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to asu 2016-09, which positively impacted our net income and earnings per share, but was partially offset by an increase of approximately 550,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding. the combination of both tax reform and asu 2016-09 resulted in a total net benefit of $0.52 to our diluted earnings per share in 2017.
net income attributable to pool corporation increased 29% compared to 2016, while earnings per share was up 30% to $4.51 per diluted share. excluding the $0.28 per diluted share impact of tax reform and the $0.24 per diluted share impact of asu 2016-09, diluted earnings per share increased 15% over last year.
financial position and liquidity cash provided by operations was $175.3 million in 2017. combined with $82.1 million in net proceeds from borrowings, cash from operating activities helped fund the following initiatives:
•   share repurchases in the open market of $143.2 million;
•   quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders, totaling $58.0 million for the year;
•   growth in net working capital of $49.9 million;
•   net capital expenditures of $39.4 million; and
•   payments of $12.8 million for acquisitions.
total net receivables, including pledged receivables, increased 18% compared to december 31, 2016, reflective of fourth quarter sales growth and acquisitions. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.9 million at december 31, 2017 and $4.1 million at december 31, 2016.
inventory levels grew 10% to $536.5 million at december 31, 2017 compared to $486.1 million at december 31, 2016. our reserve for inventory obsolescence was $6.3 million at december 31, 2017 compared to $6.5 million at december 31, 2016. our inventory turns, as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis, were 3.5 times at december 31, 2017 and 3.6 times at december 31, 2016.
19
total debt outstanding of $519.7 million at december 31, 2017 increased $81.6 million or 19% compared to december 31, 2016 primarily to fund share repurchases and working capital growth.
current trends and outlook over the last five years, we estimate the pool industry grew from 2% to 4% per year due to growth in the installed base of pools, which helped drive pool maintenance growth, improvement in remodeling and replacement activity and annual growth in the pool construction market. improvements in general external market factors in the united states including consumer confidence, employment, housing, consumer financing and economic expansion, largely support our base business growth. we feel these positive external trends have promoted increased consumer spending on higher value products that enhance swimming pools and outdoor living spaces. our consistent base business sales growth reflects industry growth plus market share gains from existing customers expanding their businesses and our success in newer market initiatives such as hardscapes and commercial pools.
while we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 75,000 new units in 2017 from the historically low levels experienced during the economic downturn, construction levels are still down approximately 65% compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50% to 55% from what we consider normal levels. favorable weather plays a role in industry growth by accelerating growth in any given year, while unfavorable weather impedes growth. in 2017 specifically, our industry experienced modestly favorable weather overall, despite the severe storms that impacted our industry in texas and florida in september and october. due to the repairs required following major storms, sales mostly recovered by the end of the year. in 2016, an earlier start to the pool season due to warmer than usual temperatures and overall favorable weather throughout the rest of the year benefited the industry as a whole. in 2015, excessive precipitation impacted our industry in the second quarter; however a mild fall and delayed winter alleviated any contraction in industry growth rates. in establishing our outlook each year, we base our growth assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance.
we believe there is potential for continued market recovery over the next several years. the great recession created a build-up of deferred replacement and remodeling activity, which we have largely fulfilled over the past seven years. we expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally, but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next four to seven years. additionally, we believe favorable demographics from an aging population and southern migration are ideal for increased residential outdoor living investment. we expect that market conditions in the united states will continue to improve, enabling further replacement, remodeling and new construction activity and that the industry will realize an annual growth rate of approximately 4% to 7% over this time period. as economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered and that residential construction activities will likely continue to improve, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long‐term growth opportunities in our industry.
we established our initial outlook for 2018 based on reasonable expectations of organic market share growth, ongoing leverage of infrastructure and continuous process improvements. for 2018, we expect the macroeconomic environment in the united states will be quite similar to 2017. we expect to continue to gain market share through our comprehensive service and product offerings, which we continually diversify through internal sourcing initiatives and expansion into new markets. we also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 4 to 6 new sales centers in 2018 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise.
the following section summarizes our outlook for 2018:
•   we expect sales growth of 6% to 7%, impacted by the following factors and assumptions:
◦   assumed normal weather patterns for 2018;
◦   anticipated continued growth from replacement, remodeling and construction activity and market expansion through newer product offerings like hardscapes and commercial pools;
◦   estimated 1% growth from acquisitions completed throughout 2017;
◦   inflationary product cost increases of approximately 1% to 2%; and
◦   one additional selling day for the full year for 2018 compared to 2017 due to an extra selling day in the fourth quarter (neutral selling days for all other quarters).
•   we project relatively neutral gross margin trends for the full year, as we believe our sales growth will continue to be weighted toward sales of lower margin discretionary products. adverse margin impacts should be offset by benefits from our efforts in supply chain management and internal pricing initiatives.
•   we expect operating expenses will grow at approximately 60% of the rate of our gross profit growth, reflecting inflationary increases and incremental costs to support our sales growth expectations. the main challenges in achieving this metric include managing people and facility costs in tight labor and real estate markets. however, we continue to see significant opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure to achieve this goal.

our provision for income taxes for 2017 was impacted by both u.s. tax reform and asu 2016-09. as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which primarily reflects the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability. in 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 25.5%, which is a reduction from our historical rate of approximately 38.5%, both of which exclude the impact of asu 2016-09. as discussed further in critical accounting estimates below, we have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of tax reform; however, our net benefit is based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations, particularly any significant changes in our geographic mix. due to asu 2016-09 requirements, we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on share-based awards lapse. based on our december 31, 2017 stock price, we estimate that we have approximately $5.4 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that will expire in the first quarter of 2018 and restricted awards that will vest in 2018. additional tax benefits could be recognized related to stock option exercises in 2018 from grants that expire in years after 2018, for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance. the estimated impact related to asu 2016-09 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly, including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options. we recorded a $12.6 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to asu 2016-09.
we project that 2018 earnings will be in the range of $5.36 to $5.61 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.13 favorable impact from asu 2016-09. this range also reflects our expected 2018 income tax rate, including the impact from tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017. we expect cash provided by operations will approximate net income for fiscal 2018, and subject to additional authorization by our board of directors, we anticipate that we will use $100.0 million to $150.0 million in cash for share repurchases.
the forward-looking statements in this current trends and outlook section are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including changes in the economy and the housing market, the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions, our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers, competition from other leisure product alternatives and mass merchants, and other risks detailed in item 1a of this form 10-k. also see "cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995" prior to item 1a.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management identifies critical accounting estimates as:
•   those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made; and
•   those for which changes in the estimate or assumptions, or the use of different estimates and assumptions, could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board. we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral. consistent with industry practices, we generally require payment from our north american customers within 30 days, except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers. the extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in april, may and june or may and june, depending on geographic location. credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations.
21
similar to our business, our customers' businesses are seasonal. sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time. we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging. these reserves range from 0.05% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 60 days past due.
at the end of each quarter, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than $20,000 and more than 60 days past due. additionally, we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts. as we review these past due accounts, we evaluate collectability based on a combination of factors including:
•   aging statistics and trends;
•   customer payment history;
•   independent credit reports; and
•   discussions with customers.
during the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. these write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. in the past five years, write-offs have averaged approximately 0.07% of net sales annually.  write-offs as a percentage of net sales approximated 0.05% in 2017, 0.07% in 2016 and 0.05% in 2015. we expect that write-offs will range from 0.05% to 0.10% of net sales in 2018.
at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end allowance for doubtful accounts balance to (i) current year write-offs and (ii) any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates, but conservative overall as 2017 write-offs came in at the low end of the expected range based on historical trends. while we slightly lowered our general reserve percentage to account for declining write-offs in recent years, our overall reserve methodology and process for estimating specific reserves remains unchanged.
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2017, pretax income would change by approximately $0.8 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.01 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2017).
inventory obsolescence product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock-outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers. to do this, we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units (skus) with the highest sales volumes. at the same time, we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory, which are not as critical to our customers and thus, inherently turn at slower rates.
we classify products into 13 classes at the sales center level based on sales at each location over the expected sellable period, which is the previous 12 months for most products. all inventory is included in these classes, except for special order non-stock items that lack a sku in our system and products with less than 12 months of usage. the table below presents a description of these inventory classes:
class 0        new products with less than 12 months usage classes 1-4    highest sales value items, which represent approximately 80% of net sales at the sales center classes 5-12   lower sales value items, which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class 13       products with no sales for the past 12 months at the local sales center level, excluding special order products not yet delivered to the customer null class     non-stock special order items
22
there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 1-4 because products in these classes generally turn quickly. we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes 5-13, which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence, with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous 12 months. the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value. we provide a reserve of 5% for inventory in classes 5-13 and non-stock inventory as determined at the sales center level. we also provide an additional 5% reserve for excess inventory in classes 5-12 and an additional 45% reserve for excess inventory in class 13. we determine excess inventory, which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months' usage, on a company-wide basis.  we also evaluate whether the calculated reserve provides sufficient coverage of the total class 13 inventory.
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence, we consider a combination of factors including:
•   the level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product, including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center and on a company-wide basis;
•   changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements;
•   seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels;
•   geographic location; and
•   superseded products and new product offerings.
we periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the above-identified factors. at the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end obsolescence reserve balance to (i) current year inventory write-offs and (ii) the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our reserve methodology is appropriate.
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20% at december 31, 2017, pretax income would change by approximately $1.3 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.02 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2017).
vendor programs many of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures.  these measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements.  we account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor's products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement.
throughout the year, we estimate the amount earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs. we accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and changes in economic conditions.  changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates, as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors.
we continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends. as a result, our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods. these adjustments tend to have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods. we update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase levels. in the first quarter of the subsequent year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.
if market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods.
23
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.
in december 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (tjca or the act) was enacted, which significantly changes u.s. tax law. in accordance with accounting standards codification topic (asc) 740, income taxes, we are required to account for the new requirements in the period that includes the date of enactment. the act reduces the overall corporate income tax rate to 21%, creates a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), broadens the tax base and allows for the immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property. due to the complexities presented by the act, particularly for companies with multi-national operations, the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin 118 (sab 118) to provide guidance to companies who are not able to complete their accounting in the period of enactment prior to the reporting deadlines. under the guidance in sab 118, companies that have not completed their accounting for certain elements of the act, but can determine a reasonable estimate of those effects, should include a provisional amount based on their reasonable estimate in their financial statements. this guidance resulted in us recording a provisional net benefit to our income tax provision during the period ended december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act but will complete our accounting before the end of the one year period allowed by sab 118. any revisions to our provisional amounts will be recorded in the period when the accounting is complete and will be recorded as a discrete item in our income tax provision in that period. for the global intangible low tax income (gilti) provisions of the act, we have elected an accounting policy to record gilti as period costs if and when incurred.
as of december 31, 2017, united states income taxes were not provided on earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries, outside of the provisions of the transition tax from u.s. tax reform. as we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held, additional income tax provisions may be required. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances, tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation. we are also still evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of u.s. tax reform.
we have operations in 39 states, 1 united states territory and 12 foreign countries. we are subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities.  we recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority. our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. we regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates. we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.  however, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.  these adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established.  as a result of these uncertainties, our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
each year, we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns. based on this hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate. differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to valuation allowances recorded for certain of our international subsidiaries with tax losses.
performance-based compensation accrual the compensation committee of our board (compensation committee) annually reviews our compensation structure to oversee management's implementation of maintaining a program that attracts, retains, develops and motivates employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking. our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility. the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria. we calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results, including operating income and diluted earnings per share (eps).
24
we use an annual cash performance award (annual bonus) to focus corporate behavior on short-term goals for growth, financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics. management sets the company's annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year. management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees. the compensation committee approves objectives for bonus plans involving executive management.
we also utilize our medium-term (three-year) strategic plan incentive program (spip) to provide senior management with an additional cash-based, pay-for-performance award based upon the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives. payouts through the spip are based on three-year compounded annual growth rates (cagrs) of our diluted eps.
we record annual performance-based compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year. we estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management's estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives. starting in june, and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end, we adjust our estimated performance-based compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan, the participants' progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management's estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans, if any.
we record spip accruals based on our total expected eps for the current fiscal year and cagr estimates for the succeeding two years. we base our current fiscal year estimates on the same assumptions used for our annual bonus calculation and our cagr estimates on historical growth rates and projections for the remainder of the three-year performance periods.
our quarterly performance-based compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to the following:
•   differences between estimated and actual performance;
•   our projections related to achievement of multiple-year performance objectives for our spip; and
•   the discretionary components of the bonus plans.
we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recently completed fiscal year. each year, we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year end to determine the accuracy of our performance‐based compensation estimates. based on our hindsight analysis, we concluded that our performance-based compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate.
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is our largest intangible asset. at december 31, 2017, our goodwill balance was $189.4 million, representing approximately 17% of total assets. goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed.
we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment.  if the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below its carrying value, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income.
since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level, our reporting unit is an individual sales center.  as of october 1, 2017, we had 221 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances. the most significant goodwill balance for a reporting unit was $5.7 million and the average goodwill balance was $0.8 million. in october 2017, 2016 and 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. in the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a $0.6 million goodwill impairment charge related to an at-risk reporting unit in quebec, canada. we continue to monitor this location's results, which came in above expectations at the end of the 2017 pool season. as of december 31, 2017, the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit was $1.8 million.
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows.  we project future cash flows using management's assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and multiples. these estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test. we also review for potential impairment indicators at the reporting unit level based on an evaluation of recent historical operating trends, current and projected local market conditions and other relevant factors as appropriate.
25
to test the reasonableness of our fair value estimates, we compared our aggregate estimated fair values to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test. we expect that a reasonable fair value estimate would reflect a moderate acquisition premium. our aggregate estimated fair values fell in line with our market capitalization, which we consider to be reasonable for the purpose of our goodwill impairment test. to facilitate a sensitivity analysis, we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate by 5% to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions. this reduction addresses the sensitivity of a 50 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate. our sensitivity analysis generated a fair value estimate significantly below our market capitalization and resulted in the identification of no goodwill impairments and no additional at-risk locations.
based on the magnitude of their goodwill balances and their heightened sensitivity to weather, we consider our reporting units in quebec, canada, as most at risk for goodwill impairment. results in quebec began to fall below expectations in 2013, largely due to an extended winter and certain execution challenges. we cannot be assured of favorable weather conditions in any given year, which strongly impact results for our quebec reporting units. as of december 31, 2017, we have three reporting units in quebec, with a total goodwill balance of $2.8 million.
if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted, we could incur additional impairment charges in future periods, especially related to the reporting units discussed above.  impairment charges would decrease operating income, negatively impact diluted eps and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. the fasb also issued subsequent amendments to asu 2014-09 to provide clarification on the guidance. asu 2014-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, which for us will be in the period beginning january 1, 2018. we are substantially complete with our detailed evaluation, using the five‐step model specified in the guidance, to determine the impact of the new standard.
•   under the new standard, revenue will be recognized when we satisfy our performance obligation by transferring promised products or services to our customer. the standard allows for application of the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics. since our individual sales transactions are very similar in nature, we will apply the guidance to all transactions as a portfolio. we have determined that the effects of applying this guidance to the portfolio is not materially different from applying the guidance to individual performance obligations within that portfolio.
•   our revenue recognition is achieved upon delivery of products as there are no other promised services as part of our contracts with customers that are material in the context of the contract. because our shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods, we do not consider these activities to be a promised service to the customer. rather shipping and handling are activities to fulfill our promise to transfer the goods. product warranties do not constitute a performance obligation for us, as products are warrantied directly by the manufacturer or the third party carrier.
•   to determine the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods, we have considered if variable consideration exists. we have reviewed our standard terms and conditions and our customary business practices to determine the transaction price. we have reviewed our pricing policies including marketing programs, coupons and free products for the purpose of determining whether we have any variable or non-cash consideration. we do not issue future-dated coupons or free product rebates. when we process manufacturer coupons, we record the customer sales price as revenue and receive reimbursement of the coupon value from the manufacturer. in addition, we reviewed our current accounting policies related to returns and price concessions for which no material changes in policy were noted. volume rebates is a sales incentive program where we make a cash payment or apply credit to a customer account on a quarterly or annual basis, if the customer reaches a specified level of purchases. the volume rebates are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price, and a liability is recorded until the related payment to the customer is made. we do not offer any volume discounts. we will continue our accounting policy election to exclude from revenue all amounts we collect and remit to governmental authorities.
•   the majority of our sales transactions do not require any additional performance obligation after delivery; therefore we do not have multiple performance obligations for which we will have to allocate the transaction price. we do not offer customer loyalty programs.
•   we expect to recognize revenue when control of the product has been transferred to the customer upon delivery to the customer or the freight carrier, if delivered by a third party, as we believe our performance obligation is satisfied at such point in time.

as allowed for under asu 2014-09, we will apply the guidance using the modified retrospective transition method, whereby we will recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings (deficit). based on our analysis, the adoption of asu 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. our adoption will result in balance sheet reclassifications for recording our estimate for customer returns. historically, our deferred revenue liability for customer returns has not been material. asu 2014-09 requires the recognition of a current liability for the gross amount of the estimated returns, and a current asset for the cost of the related products (each less than $1.0 million at december 31, 2017).
we have determined that the adoption will not require material or significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting.
the following table summarizes the remaining recent accounting pronouncements that we plan to adopt in future periods:

asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments   changes the way companies evaluate credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments. for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking "expected loss" model to evaluate impairment, potentially resulting in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures, including the requirement to disclose the information used to track credit quality by year of origination for most financing receivables. the guidance must be applied using a cumulative-effect transition method.   annual periods beginning after december 15, 2019   we are currently evaluating the effect this will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.

asu 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350), simplifying the test for goodwill impairment        eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (commonly referred to as step 2 under the current guidance). rather, the measurement of a goodwill impairment charge will be based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value (step 1 under the current guidance). this guidance should be applied prospectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                   annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods beginning after december 15, 2019   we are currently evaluating the effect this will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.
asu 2017-12, derivatives and hedging (topic 815), targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities   eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income (oci), and amounts deferred in oci will be reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.                                                                                                                                                                                            annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018                                             we are currently evaluating the effect this will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.

(1)   we acquired certain distribution assets of each of these companies.
(2)   we completed this acquisition on december 29, 2017. thus we reported no results of operations in fiscal 2017 for this acquisition due to the acquisition date; however the related sales centers are included in the sales center count below.
when calculating our base business results, we exclude sales centers that are acquired, closed or opened in new markets for a period of 15 months. we also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that are consolidated with acquired sales centers.
we generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales.  after 15 months of operations, we include acquired, consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period.

net sales
(in millions)                           year ended december 31,
2017                    2016                      change net sales              $2,788.2                  $2,570.8         $217.4              8%
net sales increased 8% compared to 2016, despite one less selling day. our 7% increase in base business sales generated much of this growth. we experienced modestly favorable weather during the swimming pool season, which ended with severe storms in september and october in both texas and florida. by the end of the fourth quarter, we mostly recovered sales lost over these time periods.
the following factors benefited our sales growth (listed in order of estimated magnitude):
•   continued improvement in consumer discretionary expenditures, including continued growth in remodeling and replacement activity (see discussion below);
•   market share growth, particularly in building materials and commercial product categories;
•   increased pool and spa chemical sales, our largest product category at 12% of total net sales for 2017, up 4% compared to 2016, excluding the recent lincoln aquatics acquisition;
•   inflation driven (estimated at close to 1%) product selling price increases; and,
•   acquisitions, particularly in the commercial market (lincoln aquatics) and australia (newline pool products)
we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings, such as building materials and equipment, evidence increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction, pool remodeling, as well as equipment upgrades. in 2017, sales for equipment such as swimming pool heaters, pumps, and lights increased 10%, and collectively represented approximately 23% of net sales. this increase reflects both the growth of replacement activity and continued demand for higher‐priced, more energy-efficient products. sales of building materials, which includes tile, grew 13% compared to 2016 and represented approximately 10% of net sales in 2017.
sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories, and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above. these sales increased 10% compared to 2016 and represented 5% of our consolidated net sales for 2017, excluding the recent acquisition of lincoln aquatics.
in terms of quarterly performance, base business sales increased 5% in the first quarter of 2017, despite a 2% decline in sales related to customer early buy purchases. base business sales then increased 7% in the second quarter of 2017 under overall neutral weather conditions for most of the quarter. despite the severe weather events in the third quarter of 2017, and one less selling day compared to the same period in 2016, base business sales increased 6% in the third quarter. for our seasonally slowest fourth quarter, base business sales increased 13% in 2017 reflecting strong consumer demand, excellent execution by our team, the recovery following hurricane irma and overall favorable weather conditions. see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below.

operating expenses increased 7% compared to 2016, with base business operating expenses up 5%. the increase in base business operating expenses was primarily due to higher growth-driven labor and freight expenses, as well as greater facility-related expenditures, equity-based compensation, and technology spending as we continue to invest in our business. base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points over 2016, as we continued to leverage our existing infrastructure.
interest and other non-operating expenses, net interest and other non-operating expenses, net increased $0.7 million compared to 2016. average outstanding debt was $504.0 million for 2017 versus $424.6 million for 2016. our 2017 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater borrowings, primarily to fund working capital growth. our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 2.7% for 2017 compared to 2.2% for 2016.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 29.0% at december 31, 2017 and 38.5% at december 31, 2016. our provision for income taxes for 2017 was positively impacted by both u.s. tax reform and asu 2016-09. as a result of the recently enacted tax legislation, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which primarily reflects the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability. in addition to the impact from tax reform, we recorded a $12.6 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to our adoption of asu 2016-09.
net income and earnings per share net income attributable to pool corporation increased 29% to $191.6 million in 2017 compared to $149.0 million in 2016. earnings per share increased 30% to $4.51 per diluted share compared to $3.47 per diluted share in 2016. excluding the $0.28 per diluted share impact of tax reform and the $0.24 per diluted share impact of asu 2016-09, diluted earnings per share increased 15% over last year.

(in millions)                           year ended december 31,
2016                    2015                      change net sales              $2,570.8                  $2,363.1         $207.7              9%
net sales increased 9% compared to 2015, with the 7% improvement in base business sales contributing much of this increase. strong execution, combined with overall favorable weather conditions and generally favorable economic and industry conditions supported our sales growth.
the following factors benefited our sales growth (listed in order of estimated magnitude):
•   very favorable weather conditions, including the second warmest year on record in the continental united states;
•   continued consumer investments in enhancing outdoor living spaces, as evidenced by improvements in sales growth rates for product offerings such as building materials and equipment (see discussion below);
•   pool and spa chemical sales, our largest product category at 13% of total net sales, increased 6% over last year; and
•   inflationary (estimated at 1% to 2%) product cost increases.
we believe that sales growth rates for certain product offerings, such as building materials and equipment, support our assertion that there continues to be increased spending in traditionally discretionary areas including pool construction, pool remodeling, as well as equipment upgrades. sales of equipment such as swimming pool heaters, pumps, and lights, which represented 8%, 7%, and 7% of our total net sales, respectively, increased collectively by 9% compared to 2015. this increase reflects both the gradual recovery of replacement activity and increased demand for higher-priced, more energy-efficient products. sales of building materials, which includes tile, represent just over 9% of net sales for 2016 and grew by 14% compared to 2015.
sales to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities are included in the appropriate existing product categories and growth in this area is reflected in the numbers above. these sales represented 4% of our consolidated net sales for 2016 and increased 16% compared to 2015 due primarily to our increased focus on the commercial market, as well as greater resources assigned to this area, including designated warehouse space, increased staffing and additional vendor relationships.
in terms of quarterly performance, base business sales increased 13% in the first quarter of 2016, as warmer than normal weather across our seasonal markets kicked off 2016, allowing for accelerated pool openings and increased ability for customers to perform remodel, replacement and new construction activity earlier in the year. as we have disclosed in recent years, 2016 customer early buy shipments again caused some second quarter sales to shift into the first quarter and accounted for approximately 3% of our first quarter 2016 sales growth. neutral weather conditions in the second and third quarters coupled with strong execution contributed to our 6% and 5% base business sales growth in the second and third quarter of 2016, respectively. for our seasonally slow fourth quarter, base business sales increased 5% in 2016 over very strong fourth quarter 2015 results, as our sales benefited from warmer than average temperatures during this time period. see discussion of significant weather impacts under the subheading seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below.

gross margin             28.8     %              28.6     %
gross margin for 2016 increased approximately 20 basis points over 2015, and benefited from improvements in supply chain management and internal initiatives, as well as favorable product mix from pool openings earlier in the year. these favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in customer early buy deliveries as these sales include applicable discounts. quarterly gross margin comparisons varied throughout the year, with an increase of 10 basis points in the first quarter, which reflects the impact of customer early buy shipments. gross margin increased 40 basis points in both the second and third quarters and increased 20 basis points in the seasonally slower fourth quarter.

2016                    2015   change operating expenses                                       $485.2                  $459.4         $25.8             6%
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales            18.9     %              19.4     %
operating expenses increased 6% compared to 2015, with base business operating expenses up 4%. while the increase in total operating expenses includes expenses from our more recent acquisitions, the increase in base business operating expenses was due primarily to higher growth-driven labor, building rent and freight expenses. focusing on efficiencies and leveraging existing infrastructure enabled us to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales.
interest and other non-operating expenses, net interest and other non-operating expenses, net increased $6.4 million compared to 2015. this increase includes $3.5 million related to a non-operating note receivable. the remaining component is primarily interest expense on debt, which increased $3.2 million over last year. average outstanding debt was $424.6 million for 2016 versus $379.2 million for 2015. our 2016 average outstanding debt balance reflects greater share repurchases than in 2015. our weighted average effective interest rate increased to 2.2% for 2016 compared to 1.9% for 2015.
income taxes our effective income tax rate was 38.5% at both december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
net income and earnings per share net income attributable to pool corporation increased 16% to $149.0 million in 2016 compared to $128.3 million in 2015, while earnings per share increased 20% to $3.47 per diluted share compared to $2.90 per diluted share in 2015.
35
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal. in general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and irrigation installations and maintenance. sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters, when we may incur net losses. in 2017, we generated approximately 62% of our net sales and 83% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.
we typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.  excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter, primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april, may and june, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june, july and august.
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2017 and 2016. we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts. in our opinion, this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data. due to the seasonal nature of our industry, the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends.

note: due to rounding, the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100%.
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.  based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends.

weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business. the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions.

•   increased purchases of above-ground pools and irrigation products unseasonably cool weather or                                              •   fewer pool and irrigation installations extraordinary amounts of rain                                             •   decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies
•   decreased purchases of impulse items such as above-ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends in spring/late cooling trends in fall   •   a longer pool and landscape season, thus positively impacting our sales
(primarily in the northern half of the u.s. and canada)
unseasonably late warming trends in spring/early cooling trends in fall   •   a shorter pool and landscape season, thus negatively impacting our sales
(primarily in the northern half of the u.s. and canada)
weather impacts on fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2016 comparisons unseasonably mild weather benefited sales in the first quarter of 2017. however, while favorable weather trends early in the year normally have a seasonally larger impact, the comparison to the first quarter of 2016 was especially tough given the benefit of the warmer-than-normal weather across nearly all markets in the united states in the first quarter of 2016. for the first quarter of 2017, texas and surrounding markets experienced record warm temperatures, which when coupled with below-average precipitation for that area, spurred higher sales growth. in two of the more seasonal regions where we operate, below-average temperatures in the north and above-average precipitation in the west negatively impacted our first quarter 2017 sales growth.
cold and wet weather throughout the mid-south and north impacted those seasonal markets in the middle of the second quarter of 2017, while the weather impact overall for the quarter was fairly neutral. temperatures and precipitation throughout most areas other than those described above, were normal, with only texas benefiting from drier weather in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the above-average rainfall experienced in the same period of 2016.
severe storms in the third quarter of 2017, particularly hurricanes irma and harvey, hindered our sales growth in florida and texas, although texas largely recovered by the end of september. in the central and midwest, temperatures were normal for the third quarter, contrasting with the above-average temperatures in the third quarter of 2016. the west experienced record heat and normal rainfall in the third quarter of 2017, similar to the above-average heat in the same period of 2016. overall, the united states experienced favorable weather in most of the fourth quarter of 2017, particularly florida, which allowed for sales recovery following hurricane irma.
weather impacts on fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2015 comparisons warmer-than-normal weather across nearly all markets in the united states benefited our first quarter of 2016 sales growth. warmer weather early in the season accelerates pool openings and allows for increased purchases of chemicals and maintenance supplies for existing pools. by comparison, our year-round markets experienced similar favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015, while our seasonal markets, particularly in the northeast united states and eastern canada, experienced cooler-than‐normal temperatures. the unusually early warm weather in the first quarter of 2016 in our seasonal markets benefited our first quarter sales. growth in our california markets in the first quarter of 2016 was impacted by unfavorable weather comparisons to the same period of 2015 due to higher winter precipitation and average temperatures in 2016 versus record warm temperatures in 2015.
37
in the second quarter of 2016, the midwest and northeast experienced more favorable conditions compared to 2015, with above‐average temperatures and much drier weather in june 2016 compared to june 2015. although the extreme rainfall experienced in texas and adjacent states was not as prevalent in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015, texas experienced above‐average precipitation again in 2016. florida and the southeast experienced cooler temperatures compared to above-average and record heat in certain areas in 2015. california and the northwest experienced warm temperatures and normal levels of precipitation in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015.
weather conditions in the third quarter of 2016 varied throughout the united states creating a neutral overall impact on our results. the eastern half of the country experienced above-average temperatures, including record high temperatures in the northeast and parts of the midwest. the western half of the united states experienced mostly normal temperatures, while texas experienced above-average precipitation. the conditions in texas in the third quarter of 2016 were in direct contrast to the weather in the same period of 2015 when texas was drying out from heavy precipitation, lifting third quarter 2015 sales. california and the northwest logged drier-than-normal conditions in the third quarter of 2016 compared to average precipitation in 2015. most of the united states experienced warm temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2016, allowing projects to continue through the remainder of the year and contributing to sales growth over the same period in 2015.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet short-term and long-term cash needs. we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business. significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following:
•   cash flows generated from operating activities;
•   the adequacy of available bank lines of credit;
•   the quality of our receivables;
•   acquisitions;
•   dividend payments;
•   capital expenditures;
•   changes in income tax laws and regulations;
•   the timing and extent of share repurchases; and
•   the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate initiatives, including acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings, which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions. the same principle applies to funds used for capital expenditures and share repurchases.
we prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business, maintaining a prudent capital structure, including a modest amount of debt, and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows:
•   capital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center structure, technology-related investments and fleet vehicles;
•   strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically;
•   payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our board of directors (board);
•   repayment of debt to maintain an average total leverage ratio (as defined below) between 1.5 and 2.0; and
•   repurchases of our common stock under our board authorized share repurchase program.
capital expenditures were 1.4% of net sales in 2017 as we expanded facilities and purchased delivery vehicles to address growth opportunities. capital expenditures were 1.4% of net sales in 2016 and 1.0% of net sales in 2015. over the last 5 years, capital expenditures have averaged roughly 1.0% of net sales. going forward, we project capital expenditures will approximate this average.

sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2017                   2016                    2015
operating activities          $175,311                $165,378                $146,050
investing activities           (52,220    )            (55,643    )            (37,793    )
financing activities          (114,449    )            (99,672    )           (107,804    )
cash provided by operations of $175.3 million for 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to the increase in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. excluding the net income benefit from tax changes, cash provided by operations approximates net income for 2017. the timing of our early buy inventory purchases can create fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable balances from year to year. a change in the timing of one of our inventory early buy programs in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted in higher inventory but lower accounts payable balances at year end, resulting in a negative impact to our 2017 operating cash flows.
in 2016, cash provided by operations improved compared to 2015 primarily due to our net income growth.
cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 due to a decrease of $6.9 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2016. this was offset by an additional $5.0 million of net capital expenditures in 2017 compared to 2016 to fund our continued investment in new vehicles, equipment and technology. related to the increase from 2015 to 2016, our 2016 cash used in investing activities reflects $19.7 million in net payments to fund acquisitions compared to $4.5 million in net payments to fund acquisitions in 2015.
cash used in financing activities increased in 2017, primarily due to lower net borrowings on our debt arrangements. we had $82.1 million of net proceeds from our debt arrangements in 2017 compared to $109.4 million in 2016, primarily as a result of lower share repurchases. we repurchased $143.2 million of shares in the open market in 2017 compared to $175.6 million in 2016. in 2015, we had net proceeds from our debt arrangements of $8.9 million, while we repurchased $92.4 million of shares in the open market.
future sources and uses of cash to supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital, we will continue to utilize our two major credit facilities, which are the amended and restated revolving credit facility (the credit facility) and the receivables securitization facility (the receivables facility). for additional details regarding these facilities, see note 5 of our "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
revolving credit facility on september 29, 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility. the credit facility provides for $750.0 million in borrowing capacity under a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility and includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit.  pursuant to an accordion feature, the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to $75.0 million, to a total of $825.0 million.  the credit facility matures on september 29, 2022. we intend to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes, for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives.
at december 31, 2017, there was $410.4 million outstanding, a $4.2 million standby letter of credit outstanding and $335.4 million available for borrowing under the credit facility. we utilize interest rate swap contracts and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on the credit facility.  as of december 31, 2017, we have three interest rate swap contracts in place that became effective on october 19, 2016. these swap contracts were previously forward-starting and were amended in october 2015 to bring the fixed rates per our forward-starting contracts in line with current market rates and extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility. now effective, these amended swap contracts convert the credit facility's variable interest rate to fixed rates of 2.273% on a notional amount of $75.0 million and 2.111% on two separate notional amounts, one $25.0 million and the other $50.0 million, totaling $75.0 million. interest expense related to the notional amounts under these swap contracts is based on the fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the credit facility. these interest rate swap contracts will terminate on november 20, 2019.
39
in july 2016, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract to extend the hedged period for future interest payments on our credit facility to its maturity date at that time. this swap contract will convert the credit facility's variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 1.1425% on a notional amount of $150.0 million. the contract becomes effective on november 20, 2019 and terminates on november 20, 2020.
the weighted average effective interest rate for the credit facility as of december 31, 2017 was approximately 2.9%, excluding commitment fees.
financial covenants on the credit facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which are our most restrictive financial covenants.  as of december 31, 2017, the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below:
•   maximum average total leverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our average total leverage ratio must be less than 3.25 to 1.00. average total leverage ratio is the ratio of the trailing twelve months (ttm) average total funded indebtedness plus the ttm average accounts securitization proceeds divided by the ttm ebitda (as those terms are defined in the credit facility). as of december 31, 2017, our average total leverage ratio equaled 1.63 (compared to 1.56 as of december 31, 2016) and the ttm average total debt amount used in this calculation was $524.3 million.
•   minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. on the last day of each fiscal quarter, our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00. fixed charge ratio is the ratio of the ttm ebitdar divided by ttm interest expense paid or payable in cash plus ttm rental expense (as those terms are defined in the credit facility). as of december 31, 2017, our fixed charge ratio equaled 5.53 (compared to 5.41 as of december 31, 2016) and ttm rental expense was $54.3 million.
the credit facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50% of the preceding year's net income (as defined in the credit facility), provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the payment of dividends.  additionally, we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50% limit described above so long as (i) the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50% limit and (ii) our average total leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends. further, dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice.
under the credit facility, we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the repurchase of shares, and our maximum average total leverage ratio (determined on a pro forma basis) is less than 2.50 to 1.00.  other covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, merge or consolidate, and sell or transfer assets.  failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the credit facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt.
receivables securitization facility as amended on november 28, 2017, our two-year receivables facility offers us a lower cost form of financing, with a peak funding capacity of up to $255.0 million between may 1 and june 30, which includes an additional seasonal funding capacity that is available between march 1 and july 31. other funding capacities range from $80.0 million to $220.0 million throughout the remaining months of the year.
the receivables facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary (the securitization subsidiary). the securitization subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities. upon payment of the receivables by customers, rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected, we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due.
the receivables facility contains terms and conditions (including representations, covenants and conditions precedent) customary for transactions of this type. additionally, an amortization event will occur if we fail to maintain a maximum average total leverage ratio (average total funded debt/ebitda) of 3.25 to 1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (ebitdar/cash interest expense plus rental expense) of 2.25 to 1.00.
at december 31, 2017, there was $100.0 million outstanding under the receivables facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 2.3%, excluding commitment fees.
40
as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our credit facility and our receivables facility.  we believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2018.  for additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise.  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates. if suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing, we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions.
as of february 21, 2018, $53.4 million of the current board authorized amount under our authorized share repurchase plan remained available. we expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions. we plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under the credit and receivables facilities.
contractual obligations at december 31, 2017, our contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases were as follows (in thousands):
payments due by period total         less than1 year               1-3 years               3-5 years       more than5 years long-term debt        $519,337              $8,898                  $100,000                $410,439             $-

for additional discussion related to our debt, see note 5 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k.  the table below contains estimated interest payments (in thousands) related to our long-term debt obligations listed in the table above.  our estimates of future interest payments are calculated based on the december 31, 2017 outstanding debt balances, using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of december 31, 2017 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts.  to project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above, we have projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the credit facility and the receivables facility. for certain of our contractual obligations, such as unrecognized tax benefits, uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time. as such, we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table. see note 7 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," included in item 8 of this form 10-k for more information related to our unrecognized tax benefits.
estimated payments due by period total           less than1 year                    1-3 years              3-5 years        more than5 years interest   $60,405         $14,076                        $25,684                $20,645              $-

executive summary this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (management's discussion) analyzes the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of nisource and its subsidiaries. it also includes management's analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. see "note regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially.
management's discussion is designed to provide an understanding of nisource's operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
nisource is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. nisource generates substantially all of its operating income through these rate-regulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations.
refer to the "business" section under item 1 of this annual report and note 22, "segments of business," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of nisource's regulated utility business segments.
nisource's goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on long-term infrastructure investment programs. these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. additionally, nisource continues to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on nisource's system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner.
summary of consolidated financial results nisource's operations are affected by the cost of sales. cost of sales for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. cost of sales for the electric operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal, related handling costs, natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity.
the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues. as a result, nisource believes net revenues, a non-gaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization), provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability. the presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. net revenues do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable gaap measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

on a consolidated basis, nisource reported income from continuing operations of $128.6 million or $0.39 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 compared to $328.1 million or $1.02 per basic share for the same period in 2016. the decrease in income from continuing operations during 2017 was due primarily to a charge to tax expense of $161.1 million as a result of implementing the provisions of the tcja and a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $111.5 million, partially offset by increased operating income, as discussed below.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, nisource reported operating income of $910.6 million compared to $858.2 million for the same period in 2016. the higher operating income was primarily due to increased net revenues, attributable to new rates from base rate proceedings, increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects at nipsco and the effects of increased customer growth, partially offset by warmer weather which reduced revenue in 2017 compared to 2016. additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher outside service costs, increased employee and administrative expenses, higher depreciation expense, increased property and payroll taxes and higher environmental expenses.
other income (deductions)
other income (deductions) in 2017 reduced income $467.5 million compared to a reduction of $348.0 million in 2016. this change is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2017.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the tcja, which, among other things, enacted significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including the continuation of certain interest expense deductibility and excluding 100% expensing of capital investments. these changes are effective january 1, 2018. gaap requires the effect of a change in tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment. as a result, in december 2017, nisource recorded a $161.1 million net increase in tax expense related primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards.
the reduction in the statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate in 2018 is expected to lead to a decrease in nisource's annual effective tax rate. nisource is still evaluating the full impact of the tcja's provisions on its future effective tax rate and cannot reasonably estimate its impact at this time.

capital investment in 2017, nisource invested approximately $1.7 billion in cash capital expenditures across its gas and electric utilities. these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of the company's gas distribution system, construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining nisource's existing electric generation fleet. nisource continues to execute on an estimated $30 billion in total projected long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments and expects to invest approximately $1.7 to $1.8 billion in capital during 2018 to continue to modernize and improve its system across all seven states.
liquidity as discussed in further detail below in "liquidity and capital resources," the enactment of the tcja will have an unfavorable impact on nisource's liquidity beginning in 2018; however, nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, long-term debt agreements and nisource's ability to access the capital markets, there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2018 and beyond. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, nisource had approximately $998.9 million and $683.7 million, respectively, of net liquidity available, consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities.
these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of "results and discussion of segment operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
regulatory developments in 2017, nisource continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states of its operating area. the discussion below summarizes significant regulatory developments that transpired during 2017:
gas distribution operations.
•   nipsco's base rate case remains pending before the iurc. the request, which seeks nipsco's first natural gas base rate increase in more than 25 years, supports continued investment in system upgrades, technology improvements and other measures to increase pipeline safety and system reliability. inclusive of various tracker programs, the case seeks an annual revenue increase of $117.9 million, which includes the impact of federal tax reform. an order is expected in the second half of 2018.
•   columbia of ohio's pending settlement agreement to continue its irp for a five-year extension was approved by the puco on january 31, 2018. this well-established pipeline replacement program covers replacement of priority mainline pipe and targeted customer service lines.
•   nipsco continues to execute on its seven-year, $850 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. on december 28, 2017 the iurc approved the latest tracker update request, covering $59.0 million of investments made in the first half of 2017.
•   new rates went into effect on october 27, 2017 following approval of columbia of maryland's base rate case settlement by the mpsc. the settlement supports continued accelerated replacement of aging pipe as well as adoption of additional pipeline safety upgrades and increases annual revenue by $2.4 million.
•   on october 31, 2017, columbia of massachusetts filed its gsep for the 2018 construction year. columbia of massachusetts is proposing to recover incremental revenue of $9.7 million including a waiver to collect the $3.1 million revenue requirement in excess of the gsep cap provision. if the waiver is not approved, the revenue requirement will be $6.6 million. an order is expected from the massachusetts dpu in the second quarter of 2018, with new rates effective may 1, 2018.
•   on march 17, 2017 the vscc, by final order, approved a settlement agreement without modification in columbia of virginia's 2016 base rate case. the settlement allows for a $28.5 million annual revenue increase and for columbia of virginia to recover investments that improve the overall safety and reliability of its distribution system. the case also supported the growth of columbia of virginia's system driven by increased customer demand for service. columbia of virginia implemented interim base rates, subject to refund, on september 28, 2016. under the terms of the final order, during 2017 columbia of virginia refunded the difference between the interim customer rates implemented in 2016 and the rates approved by the final order.

•   on april 26, 2017 the puco approved columbia of ohio's annual irp rider adjustment. this order supports the continuation of significant infrastructure investment and allows for $31.5 million in increased annual revenues on $235.9 million of investment.
electric operations.
•   nipsco continues to execute on its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. the iurc-approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. on october 31, 2017 the iurc approved nipsco's latest tracker update request, covering $133.6 million in investments from may 2016 through april 2017.
•   on december 13, 2017, the iurc approved a settlement in nipsco's november 2016 request to invest in environmental upgrades at its michigan city unit 12 and r.m. schahfer units 14 and 15 generating facilities. the settlement included authority and cost recovery for the company's approximately $193 million of ccr projects.
•   as part of its 2016 irp, nipsco remains on schedule with its planned may 2018 retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8. the retirement is part of nipsco's plan to retire 50 percent of its coal-fired generating fleet by the end of 2023.

comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations.
2017 vs. 2016 operating income for 2017, gas distribution operations reported operating income of $545.6 million, a decrease of $28.4 million from the comparable 2016 period.
net revenues for 2017 were $2,097.1 million, an increase of $161.9 million from the same period in 2016. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $124.2 million.
•   higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $26.9 million.
•   the effects of increased customer growth of $10.3 million.
•   higher revenues from increased industrial usage of $5.8 million.
operating expenses were $190.3 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased employee and administrative expenses of $62.2 million.
•   higher outside service costs of $52.8 million due to it service provider transition costs, increased spend on strategic initiatives to enhance safety, reliability and customer value and higher pipeline maintenance expenses.
•   increased regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $26.9 million.
•   higher depreciation of $15.2 million due to increased capital expenditures placed in service.
•   increased property taxes of $8.1 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service and an accrual adjustment recorded in 2016.
•   higher environmental costs of $4.7 million.
•   increased materials and supplies expenses of $3.4 million from maintenance-related activities.
2016 vs. 2015 operating income for 2016, gas distribution operations reported operating income of $574.0 million, an increase of $18.2 million from the comparable 2015 period.
net revenues for 2016 were $1,935.2 million, an increase of $21.6 million from the same period in 2015. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $95.1 million.
•   the effects of increased customer count of $9.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $52.8 million.
•   the effects of warmer weather of $12.4 million.
•   decreased commercial, industrial and residential usage of $8.8 million.
•   lower forfeited discount and late payment collections of $3.9 million.
operating expenses were $3.4 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased employee and administrative expenses of $26.1 million.
•   higher depreciation of $19.8 million due to increased capital expenditures placed in service.
•   increased outside service costs of $13.4 million.
•   higher rental expense of $2.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   lower regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $52.8 million.
•   decreased gross receipts taxes of $2.8 million.

weather in general, nisource calculates the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. nisource's composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations. heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degree day comparison.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2017 was about 12% warmer than normal and about 4% warmer than 2016, decreasing net revenues $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2016 was about 9% warmer than normal and about 6% warmer than 2015, decreasing net revenues $12.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2017 were 973.2 mmdth, compared to 971.7 mmdth for 2016.
total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2016 were 971.7 mmdth, compared to 988.7 mmdth for 2015. this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2016 compared to 2015.
economic conditions all nisource gas distribution operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. as noted above, gas costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings.
at nipsco, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. these amounts are primarily reflected in the "other" operating revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. the adjustments to other operating revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were a revenue decrease of $4.8 million, a revenue increase of $43.3 million and a revenue decrease of $68.0 million, respectively.
certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. these programs serve to further reduce nisource's exposure to gas prices.

comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations.
2017 vs. 2016 operating income for 2017, electric operations reported operating income of $364.8 million, an increase of $73.4 million from the comparable 2016 period.
net revenues for 2017 were $1,272.6 million, an increase of $106.0 million from the same period in 2016. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings of $63.6 million.
•   increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects of $24.2 million.
•   higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $18.0 million.
•   new rates from infrastructure replacement programs of $6.0 million.
•   the effects of increased customer count of $3.4 million.
partially offset by:
•   the effects of cooler weather of $16.1 million.
operating expenses were $32.6 million higher in 2017 than 2016. this change was primarily driven by:
•   higher outside service costs of $20.1 million, primarily due to increased spend on strategic initiatives to enhance safety, reliability and customer value, generation-related maintenance, it service provider transition costs and vegetation management activities.
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $18.0 million.
•   higher employee and administrative expenses of $11.9 million.
•   increased depreciation of $5.6 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service.
•   higher materials and supplies expenses of $4.5 million driven by generation-related maintenance.
partially offset by:
•   plant retirement costs of $22.1 million in 2016.
•   decreased amortization of regulatory assets of $10.8 million.
2016 vs. 2015 operating income for 2016, electric operations reported operating income of $291.4 million, an increase of $27.0 million from the comparable 2015 period.
net revenues for 2016 were $1,166.6 million, an increase of $80.6 million from the same period in 2015. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings of $36.3 million.
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in expense, of $30.2 million.
•   increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects of $17.8 million.
•   the effects of warmer weather of $15.6 million.
partially offset by:
•   the absence of regulatory-deferred miso cost amortization of $10.2 million.
•   increased fuel handling costs of $7.8 million.
operating expenses were $53.6 million higher in 2016 compared to 2015. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $30.2 million.
•   higher outside service costs of $24.4 million, primarily due to generation-related maintenance.

•   decreased amortization expense of $9.6 million.
weather in general, nisource calculates the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days. nisource's composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of electric operations. heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating or cooling degree day comparison.
weather in the electric operations' territories for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was 4% warmer than normal and 15% cooler than the same period in 2016, leading to a decrease in net revenues of approximately $16.1 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
weather in the electric operations' territories for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was 23% warmer than normal and 30% warmer than the same period in 2015, leading to an increase in net revenues of approximately $15.6 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
sales electric operations sales were 16,725.6 gwh for 2017, a decrease of 105.6 gwh, or 0.6% compared to 2016.
electric operations sales were 16,831.2 gwh for 2016, a increase of 72.9 gwh, or 0.4% compared to 2015.
economic conditions nipsco has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs. as noted above, fuel costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings.
at nipsco, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. these amounts are primarily reflected in the "other" operating revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. the adjustments to other operating revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were a revenue decrease of $5.2 million, a revenue increase of $33.1 million and a revenue decrease of $11.6 million, respectively.
nipsco's performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. nipsco's mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 54.5% and 52.3% of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
electric supply nipsco 2016 integrated resource plan. environmental, regulatory and economic factors, including low natural gas prices and aging coal-fired units, have led nipsco to pursue modification of its current electric generation supply mix to include less coal-fired generation. due to enacted ccr and elg (subsequently postponed) regulations, nipsco would expect to have incurred over $1 billion in operating, maintenance, environmental and other costs if the current fleet of coal-fired generating units were to remain operational.
on november 1, 2016, nipsco submitted its 2016 integrated resource plan with the iurc. the plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years. the 2016 integrated resource plan indicates that the most viable option for customers and nipsco involves the retirement of bailly generating station (units 7 and 8) as soon as mid-2018 and two units (units 17 and 18) at the r.m. schahfer generating station by the end of 2023. it is projected over the long term that the cost to customers to retire these units at these dates will be lower than maintaining and upgrading them for continuing generation.

nisource and nipsco committed to the retirement of the bailly generating station units in connection with the filing of the 2016 integrated resource plan, pending approval by the miso. in the fourth quarter of 2016, the miso approved nipsco's plan to retire the bailly generating station units by may 31, 2018. in accordance with asc 980-360, the remaining net book value of the bailly generating station units was reclassified from "net utility plant" to "other property, at cost, less accumulated depreciation" on the consolidated balance sheets.
in connection with the miso's approval of nipsco's planned retirement of the bailly generating station units, nisource recorded $22.1 million of plant retirement-related charges in the fourth quarter of 2016. these charges were comprised of contract termination charges related to nipsco's capital lease with pure air, voluntary employee severance benefits, and write downs of certain materials and supplies inventory balances. these charges are presented within "operation and maintenance" on the statements of consolidated income.
on february 1, 2018, as previously approved by the miso, nipsco commenced a four-month outage of bailly generating station unit 8 in order to begin work on converting the unit to a synchronous condenser (a piece of equipment designed to maintain voltage to ensure continued reliability on the transmission system). approximately $15 million of net book value of unit 8 remained in "net utility plant" as it is expected to remain used and useful upon completion of the synchronous condenser, while the remaining net book value of approximately $143 million was reclassified to "regulatory assets (noncurrent)" on the consolidated balance sheets. these amounts continue to be amortized at a rate consistent with their inclusion in customer rates. nipsco expects to complete the retirement of units 7 and 8 by may 31, 2018. refer to note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information.

liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $742.1 million, a decrease of $62.0 million from 2016. this decrease was driven by $282.3 million of pension plan contributions in 2017, partially offset by a combination of changes in weather, gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery, which significantly impacted regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities between the two periods as discussed further below.
net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $804.1 million, a decrease of $359.3 million from 2015. this decrease was driven by a combination of changes in weather, gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery, which significantly impacted regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities and working capital between the two periods. during 2015, natural gas prices were declining faster than the gas cost adjustments being collected from customers, resulting in an associated source of cash from working capital. during 2016, these over-collected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers, resulting in a use of working capital.
regulatory assets and liabilities. during the year ended december 31, 2016, over-collected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers resulting in a use of cash. in 2017, less cash was required to be returned to customers because the balance of over-collected gas costs from 2016 was smaller than in 2015.
pension and other postretirement plan funding. in 2017, nisource contributed $282.3 million to its pension plans (including a $277 million discretionary contribution made during the third quarter of 2017) and $31.6 million to its other postretirement benefit plans. the return on assets related to the discretionary pension contribution is expected to result in a decrease to net periodic benefit costs beginning in 2018. however, due to increasing workforce retirements, certain nisource pension plans are expected to trigger settlement accounting annually for the foreseeable future. the resulting charges from settlement accounting, if realized, are expected to partially offset this decrease in periodic benefits costs.
in 2018, nisource expects to make contributions of $2.9 million to its pension plans and $25.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. given the current funded status of the pension plans, and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of its plan assets, nisource does not believe additional material contributions to its pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future.
income taxes. rates for nisource's regulated customers include provisions for the collection of u.s. federal income taxes. the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tcja is expected to lead to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates, ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities. nisource is currently working to estimate the impact of this revenue reduction.
in addition, nisource will be required to pass back to customers "excess deferred taxes" which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which, as a result of the passage of the tcja, are now expected to be less than the originally billed amounts. approximately $1.5 billion of excess deferred taxes related to implementation of the tcja are presented within "regulatory liabilities (noncurrent)" on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017. the majority of this balance relates to temporary book-to-tax differences on utility property protected by irs normalization rules. nisource expects this portion of the balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property. the pass back period for the remainder of this balance will be determined by nisource's state utility commissions in future proceedings. nisource's estimate of the amount and pass-back period of excess deferred taxes is subject to change pending final review by the utility commissions of the states in which nisource operates.
as of december 31, 2017, nisource has a recorded deferred tax asset of $508.5 million related to a federal nol carryforward. as a result of being in an nol position, nisource was not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. for nisource nols generated before december 31, 2017, the nol carryforward expires in 2037, however, nisource expects to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration.
per the tcja, utilization of nol carryforwards generated after december 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of current year taxable income. accordingly, nisource may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having nol carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable.

(1) amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity.
for 2017, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,753.8 million, which was $263.4 million higher than the 2016 capital program. this increased spending is mainly due to electric transmission projects, environmental investments and system modernization projects.
for 2016, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,490.4 million, which was $122.9 million higher than the 2015 capital program. this increased spending is mainly due to modernization projects and segment growth at the gas distribution operations segment.
for 2018, nisource projects to invest approximately $1.7 to $1.8 billion in its capital program. this projected level of spend is consistent with 2017 spend levels and is expected to focus primarily on the continuation of the modernization projects, segment growth across the gas distribution operations segment, and tdsic spend.

the change in net available liquidity between 2017 and 2016 was driven by lower utilization of short-term debt in the current year as a result of cash proceeds from other forms of financing.
debt covenants. nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. as of december 31, 2017, the ratio was 67.6%.

(1) long-term debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of $71.5 million.
(2) capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $91.9 million.
(3) operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term. the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term, but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above. expected payments are $29.3 million in 2018, $27.5 million in 2019, $19.7 million in 2020, $13.9 million in 2021, $9.6 million in 2022 and $7.4 million thereafter.
nisource calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt based on the stated coupon and payment dates. for 2018, nisource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $388.1 million, which includes $364.4 million of interest payments related to its long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2017. at december 31, 2017, nisource had $1,205.7 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.
nisource's expected payments included within "other liabilities" in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2018. plan contributions beyond 2018 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. in 2018, nisource expects to make contributions of approximately $2.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $25.0 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. refer to note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
nisource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long-term obligations classified as "total other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, other than those described above.
nisource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $222.1 million in 2018, which are not included in the table above.
refer to note 18-a, "contractual obligations," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
off-balance sheet arrangements as a part of normal business, nisource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

market risk disclosures risk is an inherent part of nisource's businesses. the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. nisource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource's businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. risk management at nisource is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. nisource's senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. these may include but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, nisource's risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.
commodity price risk nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries' operations involving natural gas and power. to manage this market risk, nisource's subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. nisource does not participate in speculative energy trading activity.
commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource's rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. if states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.
nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. the amount of these deposits, which are reflected in nisource's restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource's commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016.
interest rate risk nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $15.8 million and $11.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances. nisource and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk on long-term debt through forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource's interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016.
credit risk due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of nisource's business activities. nisource's extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy. in addition, risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations. credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. for derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.
nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers. nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

other information critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on nisource's results of operations and consolidated financial statements.
basis of accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries. asc topic 980, regulated operations, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were $1,801.2 million and $2,795.6 million at december 31, 2017, and $1,885.4 million and $1,381.8 million at december 31, 2016, respectively. for additional information, refer to note 8, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of nisource's regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980, regulated operations. in such event, a write-down of all or a portion of nisource's existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980, regulated operations, nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 980-20, discontinuation of rate-regulated accounting. in management's opinion, nisource's regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980, regulated operations for the foreseeable future.
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource's consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $398.4 million at december 31, 2017. if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.
the passage of the tcja into law necessitated the remeasurement of nisource's deferred income tax balances to reflect the new u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21%. for nisource's regulated entities, substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, as appropriate, until such time that nisource receives final regulatory orders prescribing the required accounting treatment and related impact on future customer rates. to the extent final regulatory orders received prescribe accounting treatment different from what is currently reflected in nisource's financial statements, nisource's results of operations could be impacted.
pension and postretirement benefits. nisource has defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity. these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in gaap as the "corridor" method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.
the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. nisource's discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aa-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement

nisource inc.
benefit plan costs. nisource estimates the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. nisource also considers the guidance from its investment advisors in making a final determination of its expected rate of return on assets.
for measurement of 2018 net periodic benefit cost, nisource selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 7.00% and 5.80% for its pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively.
nisource estimates the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining the company's other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon its actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.
nisource uses the society of actuaries' most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:

(1)before labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals.
in january 2017, nisource changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. this change, compared to the previous method, resulted in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. historically, nisource estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. for fiscal 2017 and beyond, nisource now utilizes a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. for further discussion of nisource's pension and other postretirement benefits, see note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
goodwill. nisource has seven goodwill reporting units, comprised of the seven state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment. nisource's goodwill assets at december 31, 2017 were $1,690.7 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1, 2000.
as required by gaap, nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. nisource's annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1, 2017.
nisource completed a quantitative ("step 1") fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1, 2016 goodwill test.
39
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
nisource inc.
consistent with nisource's historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach. a qualitative ("step 0") test was completed on may 1, 2017. nisource assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1, 2016 test. the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary.
the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions.
the long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. the long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the u.s. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates.
the may 1, 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values, indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test. if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested, holding all other assumptions constant.
revenue recognition. revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. refer to note 1-i, "revenue recognition," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
nisource adopted the provisions of asc 606 beginning on january 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, which was applied to all contracts. no material adjustments were made to january 1, 2018 opening balances as a result of the adoption and nisource does not anticipate material changes in the amount or timing of future revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of asc 606.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 2, "recent accounting pronouncements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

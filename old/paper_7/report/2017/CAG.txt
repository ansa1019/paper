fiscal 2017 performance reflected a higher gross profit in the grocery & snacks segment, offset by lower gross profits in the refrigerated & frozen, foodservice, and international segments. fiscal 2017 results were also impacted by lower sales volumes and the reduction of profits due to the divestitures of spicetec and jm swank in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the improved operating performance reflected significantly lower selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses and lower interest expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2016.
diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued

operations. several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "items impacting comparability" below).
in fiscal 2017, we completed the spinoff of lamb weston holdings, inc. ("lamb weston") through a distribution of 100% of our interest in lamb weston to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "spinoff"). the transaction effecting this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. we also completed several other acquisitions and divestitures during the year. see "acquisitions" below and "divestitures and formation of ardent mills joint venture" below. finally, we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to chicago, illinois in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the spinoff, we reorganized our reporting segments. we now reflect our results of operations in five reporting segments: grocery & snacks, refrigerated & frozen, international, foodservice, and commercial. the results of operations for the lamb weston business have been reclassified to results of discontinued operations for all periods presented, and the assets and liabilities of the lamb weston business have been reclassified to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods prior to the spinoff.

•   an income tax benefit of $14.6 million associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and certain foreign incentives.
items of note impacting comparability of results from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 included the following:

segment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and economic hedging of foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in the segment review below.
acquisitions in april 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses thanasi foods llc, maker of duke's® meat snacks, and bigs llc, maker of bigs® seeds, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, subject to a working capital adjustment (the "thanasi acquisition"). approximately $134.6 million has been classified as goodwill pending determination of the final purchase price allocation, of which $70.9 million is deductible for income tax purposes. approximately $81.2 million of the purchase price has been allocated to other intangible assets. these businesses are included in the grocery & snacks segment.

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our spicetec flavors & seasonings business ("spicetec") and our jm swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. the results of operations of spicetec and jm swank are included in the commercial segment.
on february 1, 2016, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, dated as of november 1, 2015, with treehouse foods, inc. ("treehouse"), we completed the disposition of our private brands business to treehouse for $2.6 billion in cash on a debt-free basis. the results of operations of the private brands business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
on may 29, 2014, the company, cargill, incorporated ("cargill"), and chs, inc. ("chs") completed the formation of ardent mills, a joint venture. in connection with the formation, we contributed all of the assets of conagra mills, our milling operations. we reflected the results of the conagra mills operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. our equity in the earnings of ardent mills is reflected in our continuing operations.
restructuring plans in may 2013, we announced the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan (the "scae plan"), our plan to integrate and restructure the operations of our private brands business, improve sg&a effectiveness and efficiencies, and optimize our supply chain network, manufacturing assets, dry distribution centers, and mixing centers. in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing sg&a expenses and enhancing trade spend processes and tools, which plans were included as part of the scae plan. although we divested the private brands business, we have continued to implement the scae plan, including by working to optimize our supply chain network, pursue cost reductions through our sg&a functions, enhance trade spend processes and tools, and improve productivity.
20
although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire scae plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2017, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. as of may 28, 2017, our board of directors has approved the incurrence of up to $880.5 million of expenses in connection with the scae plan. we have incurred or expect to incur approximately $446.2 million of charges ($299.2 million of cash charges and $147.0 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the scae plan. we recognized charges of $63.6 million, $281.8 million, and $47.7 million in relation to the scae plan related to our continuing operations in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we expect to incur costs related to the scae plan over a multi-year period.
segment review during fiscal 2017, we reorganized our reporting segments. we now reflect our results of operations in five reporting segments: grocery & snacks, refrigerated & frozen, international, foodservice, and commercial. prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the spinoff of the lamb weston business, which was previously included in the commercial foods segment. the results of operations of the lamb weston business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
grocery & snacks the grocery & snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail channels in the united states.
refrigerated & frozen the refrigerated & frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the united states.
international the international reporting segment principally includes branded, food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the united states.
foodservice the foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments in the united states.
commercial the commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients that were sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. the segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods sold under brands such as spicetec flavors & seasonings®. the spicetec and jm swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
presentation of derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. as such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. the gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. in the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.

the following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations, under this methodology:

as of may 28, 2017, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $3.0 million. this amount reflected net losses of $3.3 million incurred during the fiscal year ended may 28, 2017, as well as net gains of $0.3 million incurred prior to fiscal 2017. based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 2018 and losses of $1.8 million in fiscal 2019 and thereafter.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges. we recognized derivative losses of $10.8 million, $6.3 million, and $2.7 million, and derivative gains of $0.9 million within the operating results of the grocery & snacks, refrigerated & frozen, international, and foodservice segments, respectively, during fiscal 2015 in connection with these derivatives. management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.

overall, our net sales were $7.83 billion in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 10% compared to fiscal 2016.
grocery & snacks net sales for fiscal 2017 were $3.21 billion, a decrease of $168.3 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2016. results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. the decrease in sales volumes was the result of reduced trade promotions and the planned exit of certain lower-performing products. price/mix was flat as the continued progress in pricing and trade productivity was fully offset by unfavorable sales mix. the reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases are actions that are intended to build a higher quality revenue base. the frontera acquisition and the thanasi acquisition collectively contributed $36.5 million, or 1%, to segment net sales during fiscal 2017.
22
refrigerated & frozen net sales for fiscal 2017 were $2.65 billion, a decrease of $215.1 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2016. results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in sales volumes and improvements in price/mix reflected reduced trade promotions and selective base price increases, together with stock-keeping unit rationalization, which actions were intended to build a higher quality revenue base. net sales growth was also negatively affected by a transitory increase in the volume of egg beaters® in fiscal 2016 as the company's egg supply was not negatively impacted by last year's avian influenza outbreak.
international net sales for fiscal 2017 were $816.0 million, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2016. results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. the volume decrease for fiscal 2017 was driven by significant shipments in early fiscal 2016 due to recovery from the west coast port disruptions during fiscal 2015, aggressive pricing actions, reduced trade promotions, and the planned discontinuation of certain lower-margin products.
foodservice net sales for fiscal 2017 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $26.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2016. results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 4% decrease in volume offset by a 2% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in volumes primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business.
in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our spicetec and jm swank businesses. these businesses comprise the entire commercial segment following the presentation of lamb weston as discontinued operations. accordingly, there were no net sales in the commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. these businesses had net sales of $71.1 million in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures. net sales in the commercial segment were $468.1 million in fiscal 2016.
sg&a expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $1.42 billion for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $607.5 million compared to fiscal 2016. sg&a expenses for fiscal 2017 reflected the following:

international incurred an operating loss for fiscal 2017 of $168.9 million and earned an operating profit of $66.7 million in fiscal 2016. the operating loss in fiscal 2017 includes charges totaling $235.9 million for the impairment of goodwill and an intangible brand asset in our canadian and mexican operations. gross profits were $8.5 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates. operating profits were negatively impacted by $9.9 million from the impact of foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016.

foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $105.1 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2016. gross profits were $5.6 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by volume declines and product supply shortfalls. this was offset by an inventory write-down in fiscal 2016 at a foreign non-core popcorn business that we have since exited. operating profit of the foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection with our restructuring plans.
commercial operating profit was $202.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $45.4 million in fiscal 2016. the company sold the spicetec and jm swank businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, recognizing pre-tax gains totaling $197.4 million. the spicetec and jm swank businesses comprise the entire commercial segment following the presentation of lamb weston as discontinued operations. there are no further operations in the commercial segment.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2017, net interest expense was $195.5 million, a decrease of $100.3 million, or 34%, from fiscal 2016. the decrease reflects the repayment of $2.2 billion, $550 million, and $473 million of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and the third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as well as the exchange of $1.4 billion of debt in connection with the spinoff of lamb weston during the second quarter of 2017. for more information about the debt exchange, please see note 6 "discontinued operations and other divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
income taxes our income tax expense was $254.7 million and $46.4 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 32% and 27% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 reflects the following:
•   additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill sold in connection with the divestitures of the spicetec and jm swank businesses,
•   additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill in our mexican and canadian businesses, for which an impairment charge was recognized,
•   an income tax benefit for the adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with the planned divestiture of the wesson® oil business,
•   an income tax benefit for excess tax benefits allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of grant, and
•   an income tax benefit associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and certain foreign incentives.
the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 reflects the following:
•   additional tax expense related to legal entity changes for a business retained from the private brands business,
•   a charge for the prior year implementation of a new tax position, and
•   an income tax benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write-off of $348.5 million of actuarial losses under our method of accounting for pension benefits).
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 32.5%-33.5%.
25
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. our most significant affiliate is the ardent mills joint venture. our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $71.2 million and $66.1 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increases are reflective of higher profits from the ardent mills joint venture due to more favorable wheat market conditions as well as improved operational effectiveness.
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $102.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an after-tax loss of $794.4 million in fiscal 2016. results reflected the operations of lamb weston through the date of its spinoff in november 2016, as well as the results of the private brands business prior to its divestiture in the second half of fiscal 2016. we incurred significant costs associated with effecting the spinoff. these costs are included in results of discontinued operations. we recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2016, to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the private brands business to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to recognize the final loss.
earnings (loss) per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued operations. see "items impacting comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
our fiscal year end falls on the last sunday of may each year. as a result, fiscal 2016 included 52 weeks of results, while fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks of results. the exclusion in fiscal 2016 of one additional week of results than what was included in fiscal 2015 impacted our fiscal 2016 results of operations relative to our fiscal 2015 results of operations. such impacts are noted below.

overall, our net sales were $8.66 billion in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 4% compared to fiscal 2015.
grocery & snacks net sales for fiscal 2016 were $3.38 billion, a decrease of $132.8 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2015. results reflected a decrease in volume of approximately 5%, partially offset by an increase in price/mix of 1% in fiscal 2016. the decrease in volume was primarily due to the inclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in fiscal 2015, volume declines on center store consumption, as well as the negative elasticity impact on volume from pricing actions, which included reductions in trade spending as part of an overall company strategy change. price/mix improved due to the implementation of a trade reduction strategy, increased prices to offset commodity inflation on select brands, and product/mix related segmentation focus.
refrigerated & frozen net sales for fiscal 2016 were $2.87 billion, a decrease of $118.8 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2015. results for fiscal 2016 reflected an 8% decrease in volume in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015, as well as negative elasticity impact on volume due to increased prices on banquet® and other pricing actions. the avian flu outbreak contributed to net sales growth on egg beaters® as competitors experienced

supply constraints. in addition, there was a 4% increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period due to the implementation of a trade reduction strategy.
international net sales for fiscal 2016 were $846.6 million, a decrease of $96.1 million, or 10%, compared to fiscal 2015. results for fiscal 2016 reflected a 1% decrease in volume, a 11% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase in price/mix compared to the prior year. the volume decrease for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015.
foodservice net sales for fiscal 2016 were $1.10 billion, a decrease of $15.6 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2015. results for fiscal 2016 reflected an increase in volumes of 4%, offset by a decrease in price/mix of 5% compared to the prior year. the year over year decrease was driven by the impact of the inclusion of the additional week of results in fiscal 2015.
commercial net sales for fiscal 2016 were $468.1 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the exclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in 2015.
sg&a expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $2.02 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $641.2 million compared to fiscal 2015. we estimate that the inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2015 resulted in additional sg&a expenses in fiscal 2015 of approximately $18.1 million.
sg&a expenses for fiscal 2016 reflected the following:
items impacting comparability of earnings
•   a charge of $348.5 million reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability,
•   expenses totaling $232.8 million in connection with our scae plan,

grocery & snacks operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $592.9 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2015. gross profits were $53.9 million higher in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. the higher gross profit was driven by lower commodity input costs, supply chain productivity, and net realized pricing gains. this was partially offset by the volume profit impacts of the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015, soft volume consumption, and negative elasticities from pricing/trade actions. sg&a expenses increased by $50.9 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, including a $9.4 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses. operating profit of the grocery & snacks segment included a charge of $50.1 million related to impairment of the chef boyardee® brand intangible asset. grocery & snacks operating profit was impacted by charges of $51.8 million and $24.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
refrigerated & frozen operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $420.4 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 12%, compared to fiscal 2015. gross profits were $85.4 million higher in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015, driven by pricing actions on key brands, lower commodity input costs, and supply chain productivity. this was partially offset by the volume profit impacts of the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015, and negative elasticities from pricing/trade actions. sg&a expenses increased by $41.3 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, including a $27.8 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses. operating profit of the refrigerated & frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling $21.1 million and $11.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
international operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $66.7 million, a decrease of $23.6 million, or 26%, compared to fiscal 2015. gross profits were $41.6 million lower in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015, driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates. operating profit was negatively impacted by $43.0 million from the impact of foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015.
foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $97.7 million, a decrease of $11.7 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2015. gross profits were $8.7 million lower in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. foodservice gross profit included an inventory write-down in fiscal 2016 of a foreign popcorn business that we have since exited. operating profit of the foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $3.2 million in fiscal 2015 in connection with our restructuring plans.
operating profit for fiscal 2016 in the commercial segment was $45.4 million, comparable to $43.5 million in fiscal 2015.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2016, net interest expense was $295.8 million, a decrease of $32.4 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2015. the decrease reflects the repayment of debt. interest expense in fiscal 2016 and 2015 reflected a net benefit of $2.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed rate to floating rate.
income taxes our income tax expense was $46.4 million and $212.7 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. the effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 27% for fiscal 2016 and 32% for fiscal 2015.
28
income tax expense for fiscal 2016 included $8.3 million of expense related to legal entity changes for a business retained from private brands and a $2.7 million charge for the prior year implementation of a new tax position, offset by the benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write-off of $348.5 million of actuarial losses under our method of accounting for pension benefits).
in fiscal 2015, we implemented a new position and took a tax credit that applied to prior year tax returns which resulted in an income tax benefit of $5.2 million.
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. our most significant affiliate is the ardent mills joint venture. our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings were $66.1 million and $79.4 million for the fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. fiscal 2016 reflects a full year of earnings from the ardent mills joint venture, compared to the 11 months in fiscal 2015. we recognize earnings on a one-month lag for the ardent mills joint venture, due to differences in fiscal year periods.
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated after-tax losses of $794.4 million and $692.1 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
as a result of the disposition of the private brands business, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2016 to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to recognize the final loss. the results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 include a $1.51 billion impairment of goodwill and $57.6 million of impairment charges to write-down various brands and fixed assets recognized on the private brands business divestiture.
the results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 also include a pre-tax gain of $625.6 million ($379.6 million after-tax) recognized on the transactions related to the formation of ardent mills (see note 6 "discontinued operations and other divestitures" in the consolidated financial statements).
earnings (loss) per share diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued operations. diluted loss per share in fiscal 2015 was $0.59, including earnings of $1.04 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.63 per diluted share from discontinued operations.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and capital the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. if necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets. we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
during fiscal 2017, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.25 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with the consent of the lenders). this revolving credit facility replaced our existing revolving credit facility. we have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of may 28, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for unsecured investment grade credit facilities of this type. it generally requires our ratio of ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to interest expense to be not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to ebitda to be not greater than 3.75 to 1.0 (provided that such ratio may be increased at the option of the company in connection with a material transaction), with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. as of may 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement.
29
as of may 28, 2017, we had $26.2 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2017 was $65.0 million. as of may 29, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.
as of the end of fiscal 2017, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. a downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult.
we repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors. during fiscal 2017, the board of directors approved an additional $2.25 billion share repurchase authorization to the existing share repurchase program. the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. as of may 29, 2016 the company's total remaining share repurchase authorization was $131.9 million. during fiscal 2017, we repurchased 25.1 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of $1.0 billion. the company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 28, 2017 was $1.38 billion.
on july 19, 2017, the board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.2125 per share, which will be paid on august 31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 31, 2017.
during fiscal 2017, we provided a voluntary lump-sum settlement offer to certain terminated vested participants in our salaried pension plan. during fiscal 2017, $287.5 million was distributed to such participants from pension plan assets in connection with this offer. we made pension contributions totaling $163.0 million for fiscal 2017, including a $150 million voluntary contribution made in the fourth quarter to improve the funded status of our pension plans.
on november 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff of lamb weston. in connection with the spinoff, lamb weston issued to us $1.54 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the "lamb weston notes"). on november 9, 2016, we exchanged the lamb weston notes for approximately $250.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017, $880.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.9% senior notes due 2018, $154.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.1% senior notes due 2018, $86.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, and $71.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% senior notes due 2020 (collectively, the "conagra notes"), which had been purchased in the open market by certain investment banks prior to the spinoff. following the exchange, we cancelled the conagra notes. we also received a cash payment of $823.5 million from lamb weston as consideration for the spinoff.
during fiscal 2017, we repaid the entire principal balance of $550.0 million of our floating rate notes on the maturity date of july 21, 2016. we also repaid the remaining principal balance of $224.8 million of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017 and $248.2 million principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, in each case prior to maturity, resulting in a net loss from the early retirement of debt of $32.7 million.
we have access to the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program, and the capital markets. we believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities, if needed.
we have recently signed an agreement to sell our wesson® oil business. the sale remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. we expect to realize net proceeds from the sale of approximately $285 million.
we expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity, as market conditions warrant, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions, access to capital markets, and our revolving credit facility.
cash flows in fiscal 2017, we used $583.1 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.18 billion generated from operating activities, $189.3 million used in investing activities, $1.57 billion used in financing activities, and a decrease of $0.2 million in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
30
cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.14 billion in fiscal 2017, as compared to $625.5 million generated in fiscal 2016. higher operating cash flows were generated by increased operating profits in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016. the higher operating profits were achieved by reducing sg&a expenses, in large part enabled by our restructuring plans, as well as by achieving improved gross margins. the increase was also driven by the timing of income tax payments (a capital loss generated in fiscal 2016 was utilized in fiscal 2017, such that no income tax payments were required to be made for the gain realized upon the sale of the spicetec and jm swank businesses), significantly lower inventory build, due to lower sales volumes and lower per case cost of inventories, increase in accounts payable balance due to extension of certain vendor terms, and reductions of interest payments due to significant debt repayments in fiscal 2017 and 2016. also, incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2017 (earned in fiscal 2016) were $73.8 million higher than such payments made in fiscal 2016 (earned in fiscal 2015).
cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $34.7 million and $633.7 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. this reflects the activities of the private brands business we sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and those of the lamb weston business that were spun off on november 9, 2016. operating cash flows of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 were also impacted by expenses related to the spinoff.
cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $65.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $251.9 million in fiscal 2016. investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of the proceeds from the divestitures of the spicetec and jm swank businesses totaling $489.0 million in the aggregate, partially offset by capital expenditures of $242.1 million, which included several significant plant expansions and improvements, and acquisitions totaling $325.7 million, including the operating assets of frontera foods, inc. and red fork llc and the protein-based snacking businesses thanasi foods llc and bigs llc. investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $277.5 million.
cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from capital expenditures. cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from the proceeds of the divestiture of our private brands business totaling $2.60 billion, net of cash transferred and closing costs, partially offset by capital expenditures of $247.6 million.
cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $2.41 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $2.73 billion in fiscal 2016. financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of long-term debt repayments totaling $1.06 billion, cash dividends paid of $415.0 million and common stock repurchases totaling $1.0 billion. proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards were $73.8 million in fiscal 2017. cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2016 reflect debt repayments of $2.52 billion and dividends paid of $432.5 million, partially offset by employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards of $208.4 million.
cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations principally comprises borrowing by lamb weston which were transferred in connection with the spinoff.
the company had cash and cash equivalents of $251.4 million at may 28, 2017 and $798.1 million at may 29, 2016, of which $244.9 million at may 28, 2017 and $105.3 million at may 29, 2016 was held in foreign countries. the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states, with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 28, 2017. at may 28, 2017, management does not intend to permanently repatriate additional foreign cash. any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time.
our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 is approximately $285 million.
management believes that the company's sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time, make payments of anticipated quarterly dividends, complete planned capital expenditures, and make any required debt repayments, including by retiring or refinancing senior debt upon maturity (as market conditions warrant), for the foreseeable future.

off-balance sheet arrangements we use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. these are described further in "obligations and commitments," below.
variable interest entities not consolidated we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities.
we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. the lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. the lease agreements also contain contingent put options (the "lease put options") that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the "put price") in certain limited circumstances. as a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested private brands operations, these lease put options are exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease agreements. we are amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place) of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling, general and administrative expenses. as of may 28, 2017, the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was $51.8 million, of which we have accrued $8.4 million. as these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements than when vacant, we may be able to mitigate some, or all of the financial exposure created by the put options by maintaining active lease agreements and/or by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants. we do not expect to ultimately incur material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors. during fiscal 2017, one of these lease agreements expired. as a result of this expiration, we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of $6.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. these leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no material assets or liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets. we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. in making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities.
obligations and commitments as part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.0 billion as of may 28, 2017, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.3 billion as of may 28, 2017, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 28, 2017 was as follows:
payments due by period(in millions)
contractual obligations                               total             less than1 year             1-3 years             3-5 years             after 5years long-term debt                                 $2,821.3                  $189.7                      $-                $322.6                $2,309.0

total                                          $4,376.5                $1,219.3                  $196.2                $456.5                $2,504.5
1 amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. the weighted average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of may 28, 2017 was approximately 5.3%.
the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of $1.7 million.
as of may 28, 2017, we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling $565.1 million. this amount is not included in the table above, as the unfunded pension obligation is marked-to-market each fiscal year and we do not expect to be required to make payments to fund these amounts in the next few years. based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. we estimate that we will make payments of approximately $12.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension plans. see note 19, "pension and postretirement benefits" to the consolidated financial statements and "critical accounting estimates - employment related benefits" for further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.
as part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. a summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of may 28, 2017, was as follows:
amount of commitment expiration per period(in millions)
other commercial commitments            total              less than1 year              1-3 years              3-5 years        after 5years standby repurchase obligations       1.8                       0.5           0.5                    0.5                    0.3

in certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. we guarantee certain leases resulting from the divestiture of the jm swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. as of may 28, 2017, the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed six years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $4.3 million.
in certain limited situations, we also guarantee obligations of the lamb weston business pursuant to guarantee arrangements that existed prior to the spinoff and remained in place following completion of the spinoff until such guarantee obligations are substituted for guarantees issued by lamb weston. such guarantee arrangements are described below. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of november 8, 2016 (the "separation agreement"), between us and lamb weston, these guarantee arrangements are deemed liabilities of lamb weston that were transferred to lamb weston as part of the spinoff. accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of these guarantee
33
arrangements, lamb weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the separation agreement.
lamb weston is a party to a warehouse services agreement with a third-party warehouse provider through july 2035. under this agreement, lamb weston is required to make payments for warehouse services based on the quantity of goods stored and other service factors. we have guaranteed the warehouse provider that we will make the payments required under the agreement in the event that lamb weston fails to perform. minimum payments of $1.5 million per month are required under this agreement. it is not possible to determine the maximum amount of the payment obligations under this agreement. upon completion of the spinoff, we recognized a liability for the estimated fair value of this guarantee. as of may 28, 2017, the amount of this guarantee, recorded in other noncurrent liabilities, was $29.7 million.
lamb weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject, at lamb weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). under the terms of the sublease agreement, lamb weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. we have guaranteed the sublessor lamb weston's performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by lamb weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $75.0 million. we believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. as such, we believe that any financial exposure to the company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guaranty, would be largely mitigated.
the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 28, 2017 was $39.3 million. the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 28, 2017, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was $31.6 million. recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.
our audit/finance committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
marketing costs-we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant. for volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. as these factors change, management's estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time.
we have recognized reserves of $108.1 million for these marketing costs as of may 28, 2017. changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.
advertising and promotion expenses totaled $328.3 million, $347.2 million, and $312.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
income taxes-our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. deferred income tax assets represent amounts
34
available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
further information on income taxes is provided in note 15 "pre-tax income and income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
environmental liabilities-environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. management's estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
we have recognized a reserve of approximately $58.1 million for environmental liabilities as of may 28, 2017. the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy.
employment-related benefits-we incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation. in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. we use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
beginning in fiscal 2017, the company has elected to use a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the u.s. plans and certain foreign plans. historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest costs, both of which are components of pension benefit costs. the spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost. this change is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively. the pre-tax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately $27.0 million.
we have recognized a pension liability of $582.2 million and $946.6 million, a postretirement liability of $156.9 million and $201.6 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $41.5 million and $62.2 million, as of the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. we also have recognized a pension asset of $17.1 million and $3.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status.
we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles.
we recognized pension expense (benefit), including activities of discontinued operations, from company plans of $(12.9) million, $370.8 million, and $0.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $1.2 million, $348.5 million, and $6.9 million in fiscal 2017,
35
2016, and 2015, respectively. this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $207.4 million, $259.9 million, and $267.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we contributed $163.0 million, $11.5 million, and $12.7 million to the pension plans of our continuing operations in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $12.8 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2018.
one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. historically, we have selected a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a high-quality corporate bond yield curve for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. the corporate bond yield curve is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually moody's aa) available at the measurement date. at may 29, 2016, the company changed to use a spot-rate approach, discussed above. this alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.
based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 3.83% for fiscal 2017, 4.10% for fiscal 2016, and 4.15% for fiscal 2015. we selected a weighted-average discount rate of 4.19% and 3.26% for determination of service and interest expense, respectively, for fiscal 2018. a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017 would have resulted in an increase of $1.7 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2017. a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017 would have resulted in an increase of $0.4 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2017. for our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 3.90% and 3.83% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. based on this information, we selected 7.50% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2017 pension expense. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $7.2 million. we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.50% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2018. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $7.3 million.
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. we determine this assumption based on our long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. based on this information, we selected 3.63% and 3.66% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year-end pension obligation. we selected 3.66% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2017, 3.70% for fiscal 2016, and 4.25% fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.7 million for the year. a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.7 million for the year. we selected a rate of 3.63% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2018. a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million for the year. a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million for the year.
in october 2014, the society of actuaries' retirement plan experience committee published new mortality tables and recommended their use for the measurement of u.s. pension plan obligations. with the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of may 31, 2015, we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables, as adjusted for experience specific to our industry.
in october 2016, the society of actuaries' retirement plan experience committee published updated mortality improvement scales and recommended their use with base mortality tables for the measurement of u.s. pension plan obligations. with the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of may 28, 2017, we incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality improvement inherent in these new tables.
36
we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. we recognized postretirement benefit expense (benefit) of $(1.2) million, $0.2 million, and $6.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we reflected liabilities of $156.9 million and $201.6 million in our balance sheets as of may 28, 2017 and may 29, 2016, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $18.7 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2018.
the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. these assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates (also discussed above), and other factors. the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.18% for fiscal 2017, 3.50% for fiscal 2016, and 3.65% for fiscal 2015. we have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.33% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2018. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 8.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 4.5% by 2024. a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
($ in millions)                                        one percentincrease   one percentdecrease effect on total service and interest cost                    $0.4            $(0.3             )
effect on postretirement benefit obligation   8.1                            (7.3              )
we provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. the weighted-average discount rate used at may 28, 2017 was 3.08%. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation expense or the liability.
business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment), identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill-we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. as a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
we reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment) to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. we generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group. if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair values. the estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group.
determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. the costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.
we reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). fair value is

typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.
in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
if we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize a "relief from royalty" methodology. the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. when determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital.
goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
in testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.
under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.
under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering expected long term growth rates and trends). estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized. in the second step, we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of

the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). the impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. as a result of adopting accounting standards update ("asu") 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the spinoff, we changed our reporting segments. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level (at the operating segment or one level lower, as applicable). when such a determination was made, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment analysis for each of the new reporting units.
we performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new canadian reporting unit within the new international reporting segment. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. we estimated the future cash flows of the canadian reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 7.5% and 2%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. accordingly, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $139.2 million for the impairment of goodwill. the remaining goodwill balance of the canadian reporting unit as of may 28, 2017 was $43.4 million.
as part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the canadian reporting unit, with the assistance of the third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of a canadian brand to be less than its carrying value. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million to write-down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value.
we also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit within the international reporting segment using similar methods to those described above. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we determined that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5%. accordingly, we did not recognize an impairment of the goodwill in the mexican reporting unit.
during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due to foreign exchange rates, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. we recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $43.9 million for the impairment of goodwill.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, we adopted asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new mexican reporting unit. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 9.0% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit. we recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million, equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the remaining goodwill balance of the mexican reporting unit as of may 28, 2017 was $118.5 million.

in fiscal 2017, due to declining sales of certain brands, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles of those brands. during fiscal 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $7.1 million for our del monte® brand and $5.5 million for our aylmer® brand in our international segment. we also recognized impairment charges of $67.1 million for our chef boyardee® brand and $1.1 million for our fiddle faddle® brand in our grocery & snacks segment.
in fiscal 2016, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. during fiscal 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $50.1 million in our grocery & snacks segment for our chef boyardee® brand.
in fiscal 2015, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. during fiscal 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $4.8 million in our grocery & snacks segment for our poppycock® brand.
because forecasted sales and profits for a reporting unit in our divested private brands business continued to fall below our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015, we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill on this private brands segment reporting unit in fiscal 2015. we recorded charges totaling $20.9 million for the impairment of goodwill in the portion of the business we retained from the private brands segment that is now included in the grocery & snacks segment.
we completed the divestiture of our private brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2016, we recognized charges of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the private brands business.
during fiscal 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $1.51 billion and $43.9 million for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, respectively, in our private brands business. during fiscal 2015, we also recognized a charge of $13.7 million in our private brands business for the impairment of certain long-lived assets. the impairment was measured based upon an estimated disposal value for the related production facility. these impairment charges are included in discontinued operations.

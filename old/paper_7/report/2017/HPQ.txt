•   contractual and other obligations. an overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions, cost-saving plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements of our continuing operations.
the discussion of financial condition and results of our continuing operations that follows provides information that will assist the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.
hp inc. separation transaction on november 1, 2015, we completed the separation of hewlett packard enterprise company ("hewlett packard enterprise"), hewlett-packard company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the "separation"). in connection with the separation, hewlett-packard company changed its name to hp inc. ("hp").
in connection with the separation, we and hewlett packard enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between hp and hewlett packard enterprise going forward, including among others a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a real estate matters agreement and a master commercial agreement.

overview we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services. we sell to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ("smbs") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. we have three segments for financial reporting purposes: personal systems, printing and corporate investments. the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer personal computers ("pcs"), workstations, thin clients, commercial tablets and mobility devices, retail point-of-sale systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support and services for the commercial and consumer markets. the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices. corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation projects.
•   in personal systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through hyper market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. additionally, we are investing in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks, detachable notebooks and mobility devices in order to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices. the beginning of a market shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on device as a service. we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•   in printing, our strategic focus is on business printing, a shift to contractual solutions and graphics, as well as expanding our footprint in the 3d printing marketplace. business printing includes delivering solutions to smbs and enterprise customers, such as multi-function and pagewide printers, including our jetintelligence lineup of laserjet printers. the shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on managed print services and instant ink, which presents strong after-market supplies opportunities. in the graphics space, we are focused on innovations such as our indigo and latex product offerings. we plan to continue to focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to higher value units and expanding our innovative ink, laser, graphics and 3d printing programs. we continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on high-value products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models. our focus is on placing higher value printer units which offer strong annuity of toner and ink, the design and deployment of a3 products and solutions, accelerating growth in graphic solutions and 3d printing.
we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends, such as flat pc device and home printing markets. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.
•   in personal systems, we face challenges with continued increases in commodity costs, especially in memory, and the uncertainty of the pc market's ability to absorb price increases driven by higher commodity costs.
•   in printing, we are seeing signs of stabilization of demand in consumer and commercial markets, but are still experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment. we obtained a number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. for instance, we source majority of our a4 and a portion of a3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon. any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement.
our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. accordingly, we face global macroeconomic challenges such as the june 23, 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union (commonly known as "brexit"), uncertainty in the markets and weaker macroeconomic conditions. the impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time.
to address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. in addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities.

we typically experience higher net revenues in our first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp's board of directors. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met, including industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain non-standard terms and conditions. further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements.
we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. for elements with no standalone value, we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable. if the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. in arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.
we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ("tpe"), if vsoe of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp"), if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available. we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. we
34
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. esp is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. we may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp. in most arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. however, the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods, but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.
we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. for certain incentive programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.
for hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added solution providers) when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. for indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale.
we recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period.
warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the product. over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 2.0% and 2.3% of annual net revenue, respectively.
restructuring and other charges we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. other charges include non-recurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation. for a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in "results of operations" below and in note 3, "restructuring and other charges" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
retirement and post-retirement benefits our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. the expected long-term return on plan assets is
35
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. we update the expected long-term return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the long-term expected return has changed. in any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim re-measurement.
our major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount rate, expected increase in compensation levels and expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2017:
change in net periodicbenefit cost in millions assumptions:
discount rate                                                             $7
expected increase in compensation levels                                  $2
expected long-term return on plan assets                                 $28
taxes on earnings we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states. we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united states federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states. further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027. material changes in our
36
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states, and our related future effective tax rate.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest. for a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or perform a quantitative impairment test. based on a qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be performed.
in the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. we base cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. we base the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. when market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.
our annual goodwill impairment analysis, performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. as a result, we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary.
fair value of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we use forwards, swaps and at times, options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. as of october 31, 2017, the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was $25 billion. assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were $121 million and $372 million, respectively as of october 31, 2017.
37
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability, we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, hp and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.
for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to note 9, "fair value" and note 10, "financial instruments", respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ("ip"), commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies", are not a meaningful indicator of hp's potential liability. litigation is inherently unpredictable. however, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of october 31, 2017, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
results of operations revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. as a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue with the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which excludes the change of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and hedging activities from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. the constant currency measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis. other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

net revenue in fiscal year 2017, total net revenue increased 7.9% (increased 8.7% on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal year 2016. net revenue from the united states increased 7.1% to $19.3 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 8.4% to $32.8 billion. the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks, desktops and supplies revenue, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
in fiscal year 2016, total net revenue decreased 6.3% (decreased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal year 2015. net revenue from the united states increased 1.7% to $18.0 billion, while net revenue from outside of the united states decreased 10.4% to $30.2 billion. the primary factors contributing to the net revenue decline were unfavorable foreign currency impacts, weak market demand, competitive pricing pressures and the change in the supplies sales model. the net revenue decline was driven by decline in supplies, commercial and consumer printers, commercial and consumer desktops and consumer notebooks, partially offset by growth in commercial notebooks.
a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under "segment information" below.
gross margin our gross margin was 18.4% for fiscal year 2017 compared with 18.7% for fiscal year 2016. the primary factors impacting the gross margin decrease were lower personal system gross margin driven by higher commodity costs, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and higher mix of personal systems revenue, partially offset by productivity improvements in printing.
our gross margin was 18.7% for fiscal year 2016 compared with 19.3% for fiscal year 2015. the decline in gross margin performance was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by operational improvements.

a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under "segment information" below.
operating expenses research and development ("r&d")
r&d expense decreased 2% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to lower spend as a result of the launch of a3 products in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by continuing investment in printing.
r&d expense increased 2% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in a3 and 3d printing, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a")
sg&a expense increased 14% in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to a gain from the divestiture of marketing optimization assets in fiscal year 2016 and an increase in field selling costs.
sg&a expense decreased 19% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to gains from the divestiture of certain software assets to open text corporation, lower corporate governance and other overhead costs related to the pre-separation combined entity, our cost-saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency impacts. these effects were partially offset by the gain from the divestiture of snapfish in the prior-year period.
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense decreased by $15 million and $86 million in fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2016 respectively, year-over-year, primarily due to assets from prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased by $157 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the restructuring plan announced in october 2016 (the "fiscal 2017 plan") and certain non-recurring costs, including those as a result of the separation.
restructuring and other charges increased by $142 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to severance pay and infrastructure related charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in september 2015 (the "fiscal 2015 plan").
interest and other, net interest and other, net expense increased by $455 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior-year period. the increase was primarily due to lower tax indemnification income in fiscal year 2017 from hewlett packard enterprise for certain tax liabilities that hp is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement.
interest and other, net expense decreased by $600 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior-year period. the decrease was primarily due to higher tax indemnification income in fiscal year 2016 from hewlett packard enterprise under the tax matters agreement and lower foreign currency losses, partially offset by lower interest income.
provision for taxes our effective tax rates were 22.9%, 29.1% and (5.3)% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our effective tax rate generally differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico, singapore, china, malaysia and ireland. we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the united states and therefore have not provided

u.s. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings. in addition to the above factors, the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2017 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and state income taxes, and the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2016 were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions.
for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
in fiscal year 2017, we recorded $72 million of net income tax benefit related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. these amounts primarily include tax benefits of $84 million related to restructuring and other charges, $12 million related to u.s. federal provision to return adjustments, $45 million related to samsung acquisition-related charges, and $13 million of other net tax benefits. in addition, we recorded tax charges of $11 million related to changes in state valuation allowances, $22 million of state provision to return adjustments, and $49 million related to uncertain tax positions.
in fiscal year 2016, we recorded $301 million of net income tax charges related to discrete items in the provision for taxes for continuing operations. these amounts primarily include uncertain tax position charges of $525 million related to pre-separation tax matters. in addition, we recorded $62 million of net tax benefits on restructuring charges, $52 million of net tax benefits related to the release of foreign valuation allowances and $41 million of net tax benefits arising from the retroactive research and development credit provided by the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 signed into law in december 2015 and $70 million of other tax benefit.
in fiscal year 2015, we recorded $1.2 billion of net income tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes for continuing operations. these amounts included $1.7 billion of tax benefits due to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain u.s. deferred tax assets, $449 million of tax charges related to uncertain tax positions on pension transfers, $70 million of tax benefits related to state tax impacts, and $6 million of income tax charges related to various other items. in addition, we recorded $33 million of income tax charges on restructuring and pension-related costs.

liquidity and capital resources we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments and share repurchases. we are
44
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a, which is incorporated herein by reference.
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with the majority of those amounts held outside of the united states. we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.
on november 1, 2017, hp made a cash payment of $1.1 billion to samsung electronics co., ltd. in connection with the acquisition of its printer business.
amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support non-u.s. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term intercompany loans into the united states. most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, some would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law. except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, we have provided for the u.s. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes. repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years. where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the united states and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. we do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on amounts repatriated to the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.4 billion for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016.the increase was primarily due to higher cash generated from working capital management activities.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, since the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 included the impact of discontinued operations, which is not included in the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016, as a result of the separation.
working capital metrics management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level. the table below presents the cash conversion cycle:
as of october 31

the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo. items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.
dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. for fiscal year 2017, the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to strong collections. for fiscal year 2016, the decrease in dso compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to favorable revenue linearity and strong collections, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.
dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2017, the dos was higher primarily due to leveraging our balance sheet, particularly through higher strategic buys and sea shipments to better assure supply of commodities in short supply. for fiscal year 2016, the dos was flat compared to fiscal year 2015 due to strong inventory management offset by higher inventory balance to support future sales levels.
dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2017, the dpo was higher primarily due to increased inventory purchases and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers. for fiscal year 2016, the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers and increased strategic inventory purchases.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to net investment activity of $1.1 billion, classified as available-for-sale investments within other current assets, collateral of $0.2 billion related to our derivatives and proceeds from a business divestiture of $0.5 billion in fiscal year 2016.
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $5.6 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, due to capital expenditures and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in fiscal year 2015 by the discontinued operations.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by $13.2 billion in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, as the net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2016 included the cash transfer of $10.4 billion to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation and the redemption of $2.1 billion of u.s. dollar global notes, and fiscal year 2017 included a higher outstanding of commercial paper of $0.9 billion.
net cash used in financing activities increased by $15.2 billion in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to the cash transfer of $10.4 billion to hewlett packard enterprise in connection with the separation, the redemption of $2.1 billion of u.s. dollar global notes and cash utilization of $2.0 billion for repurchases of common stock and dividends.

we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.
short-term debt increased by $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. the net increase in total debt was primarily due to a higher outstanding of commercial paper of $0.9 billion.
short-term debt decreased by $2.1 billion and long-term debt increased by $0.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. the net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed rate u.s. dollar global notes in november 2015.
our debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders' (deficit) equity. our debt-to-equity ratio increased by 0.54x in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in total debt balances of $1.0 billion.
our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by 2.06x in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to negative equity resulting from the transfer of net assets of $32.5 billion to hewlett packard enterprise and the redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed-rate u.s. dollar global notes due to the separation.
during fiscal year 2017 and 2016, we generated operating cash flow of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively.
our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 10, "financial instruments" in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data".
available borrowing resources we had the following resources available to obtain short or long-term financing:

2016 shelf registration statement   unspecified uncommitted lines of credit         $846
as of october 31, 2017, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion, which will be available until april 2, 2019 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes.
we increased our issuance authorization under our commercial paper program from $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion in november 2017. in december 2017, we also entered into a revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides us with $1.5 billion of available borrowings until november 30, 2018.
for more information on our borrowings, see note 11, "borrowings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. in addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have a negative impact on

(1)   amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums.
(2)   amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our u.s. dollar global notes to variable interest rates. the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31, 2017 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(4)   amounts represent the operating lease obligations, net of total sublease income of $174 million.
(5)   amounts represent the capital lease obligations, including total capital lease interest obligations of $45 million.
(6)   retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions. in fiscal year 2018, we anticipate making contributions of approximately $24 million to non-u.s. pension plans, $33 million to cover benefit payments to u.s. non-qualified pension plan participants and $7 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. for more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(7)   cost savings plans. we expect to make future cash payments of between $173 million and $323 million in connection with our cost savings plans through fiscal year 2021. these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. for more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see note 3, "restructuring and other charges", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(8)   uncertain tax positions. as of october 31, 2017, we had approximately $2.1 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. for more information on our uncertain tax positions,

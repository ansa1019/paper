item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has three reporting segments, global ceramic, flooring north america ("flooring na") and flooring rest of the world ("flooring row"). the global ceramic segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and other products including natural stone, quartz and porcelain slab countertops, which it distributes primarily in north america, europe and russia through various selling channels, which include company-owned stores, independent distributors and home centers. the segment's product lines are sold through company-operated service centers, independent distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers and contractors. the flooring na segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood, laminate and vinyl products, including lvt, which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. the segment's product lines are sold through various selling channels, including independent floor covering retailers, distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. the flooring row segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, hardwood flooring, roofing elements, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard ("mdf"), chipboards, other wood products and vinyl products, including lvt, which it distributes primarily in europe and russia through various selling channels, which include retailers, independent distributors and home centers.
the company is a significant participant in every major product category across the global flooring industry.   a majority of the company's sales and long-lived assets are located in the united states and europe. the company expects continued strong performance in the united states market if residential housing starts and remodeling continue to improve. the company also has operations in europe, mexico and russia where the company is growing market share, especially in its ceramic tile product lines. the company expects sales growth to continue on a local basis and operating income should improve despite inflation and declining patent revenues attributed to expiring patents.
the company completed four acquisitions to broaden product offerings and improve cost structure in 2017.  these include bolt-on ceramic businesses in italy and poland, a u.s. talc mine for the ceramic business and a nylon polymerization plant to further integrate our carpet manufacturing.
in 2017, the company invested over $900 million in capital projects to expand capacities, differentiate products, and improve productivity.  in 2018, the company plans to invest an additional $750 million in its existing businesses to complete projects that were begun in 2017 and to commence new initiatives. the largest investments during this two-year period are the expansion of lvt in the u.s. and europe; ceramic capacity increases in the u.s., mexico, italy, poland, bulgaria and russia; luxury laminate in the u.s., europe and russia; carpet tile in europe; sheet vinyl in russia; countertops in the u.s. and europe; and carpet and rugs in the u.s.
net earnings attributable to the company were $971.6 million, or diluted eps of $12.98 for 2017 compared to net earnings attributable to the company of $930.4 million, or diluted eps of $12.48 for 2016. the increase in eps was primarily attributable to savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives, the favorable net impact of price and product mix, and lower interest rates, partially offset by higher input costs, increased employee costs, and the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring, acquisition and integration-related, and other costs. also impacting eps was the increase in income tax expense due to the geographic dispersion of earnings. the company expects to benefit in future periods from a lower effective tax rate as a result of the recent reforms in the u.s. and belgium.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company generated $1,193.6 million of cash from operating activities. as of december 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $84.9 million, of which $14.4 million was in the united states and $70.5 million was in foreign countries.
recent events on november 20, 2017, the company announced that it agreed to acquire godfrey hirst group, the leading flooring company in australia and new zealand, further extending mohawk's global position. the acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2018 for approximately a$556.0 million ($434.2 million equivalent at december 31, 2017).

interest expense interest expense was $31.1 million for 2017, reflecting a decrease of $9.4 million compared to interest expense of $40.5 million for 2016. the decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the company's borrowings to lower interest rate instruments.
other expense (income)
other expense was $5.2 million for 2017, reflecting an unfavorable change of $6.9 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2016. the change was primarily due to the increased unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on transactions in the current year.

index to financial statements income tax expense for 2017, the company recorded income tax expense of $343.2 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,317.9 million for an effective tax rate of 26.0%, as compared to an income tax expense of $307.6 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,241.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.8% for 2016. the increase in the year-over-year effective tax rate was the direct result of the geographic dispersion of the company's earnings for 2017, decreased by $44.4 million caused by the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities triggered by the belgium corporate income tax reform, and increased by a one-time provisional net tax expense of $45.2 million resulting from the u.s. corporate income tax reform.
in december of 2017, the u.s. and belgium enacted tax reform legislation. the u.s. legislation, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"), is the most significant and complex change to the u.s. tax law in more than 30 years. the most significant provisions of the tcja, were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, implementation of a territorial income tax regime, and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries. the most significant provisions of the belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 33.99% to 29.58% for january 1, 2018 and january 1, 2019, respectively, with a further reduction to 25% effective january 1, 2020, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses, and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime.
accordingly, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company recorded a net tax expense of $0.8 million related primarily to the non-cash tax benefit of the revaluation of its belgian deferred tax liabilities, the non-cash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its u.s. deferred tax liabilities, and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the deemed repatriation transition tax.  this represents the best estimate of the impact of all tax law changes on the company's financial statements.  the company will continue to evaluate the interpretations of the tcja, the assumptions made within the calculations, and future guidance that may be issued to determine the impact, if any, on these provisional calculations, which may materially change the company's tax determinations.
as for certain other corporate income tax aspects of the tcja, specifically the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provision, the company has been unable to quantify the impacts of these provisions due to the inherent complexities involved. accordingly, the company expects to continue to analyze these provisions and their potential impacts and record any such amounts as determined during the course of 2018. see note 12-income taxes.

the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.
•   accounts receivable and revenue recognition. revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably

index to financial statements assured. the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. a 10% change in the company's allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
•   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method ("fifo"). costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required. a 10% change in the company's reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
•   acquisition accounting. the fair value of the consideration we pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill. the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. see note 2-acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.
•   goodwill and other intangibles. goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. the company has identified global ceramic, flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital ("wacc"), and comparable company market multiples. when developing these key judgments and assumptions, the company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. however, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectations regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted. generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 35% or a more than 24% increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the company are its trademarks, is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past
34
index to financial statements performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.
the company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. if such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.
the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2017.
•   income taxes. the company's effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating the company's tax positions. deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. for further information regarding the company's valuation allowances, see note 12-income taxes.
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") fasb accounting standards codification topic ("asc") 740-10. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. for further information regarding the company's uncertain tax positions, see note 12-income taxes.
•   environmental and legal accruals. environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements. in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the company consults with its internal experts. the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

index to financial statements impact of inflation inflation affects the company's manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. the company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company's production processes. although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the company's ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the company's products. there have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. in the past, the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.
seasonality the company is a calendar year-end company. with respect to its flooring na and global ceramic segments, its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter. the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments. these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. the flooring row segment's second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and fourth quarter and a weaker third quarter.

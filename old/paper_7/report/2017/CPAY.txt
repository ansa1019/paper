item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. in addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in item 1a "risk factors" appearing elsewhere in this report. all foreign currency amounts that have been converted into u.s. dollars in this discussion are based on the exchange rate as reported by oanda for the applicable periods.
general business fleetcor is a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions. we help businesses of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. we serve businesses, merchants and partners in north america, latin america, europe, and australasia. fleetcor's predecessor company was organized in the united states in 1986, and fleetcor had its initial public offering in 2010 (nyse: flt).
fleetcor has two reportable segments, north america and international. we report these two segments as they align with our senior executive organizational structure, reflect how we organize and manage our employees around the world, manage operating performance, contemplate the differing regulatory environments in north america versus other geographies, and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results.
our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor's product or another alternative method such as cash or check. our solutions are comprised of payment products, networks and associated services.
our payment products function like a charge card or prepaid card and tend to be specialized for specific spend categories, such as fuel or lodging, and/or specific customer groups, such as long haul transportation. fleetcor's five primary product lines are fuel, lodging, tolls, corporate payments and gift. additionally, we provide other payment products including fleet maintenance, employee benefits and long haul transportation-related services. our products are used in 56 countries around the world, with our primary geographies being the u.s., brazil and the united kingdom, which combined accounted for approximately 90% of our revenue in 2017.
fleetcor uses both proprietary and third-party networks to deliver our payment solutions. fleetcor owns and operates proprietary networks with well-established brands throughout the world, bringing incremental sales and loyalty to affiliated merchants. third-party networks are used to broaden payment product acceptance and use. in 2017, we processed approximately 3 billion transactions within these networks, of which approximately 1.4 billion were related to our gift product line.
fleetcor capitalizes on its products' specialization with sales and marketing efforts by deploying product-dedicated sales forces to target specific customer segments. we market our products directly through multiple sales channels, including field sales, telesales and digital marketing, and indirectly through our partners, which include major oil companies, leasing companies, petroleum marketers, value-added resellers (vars) and referral partners.
we believe that our size and scale, product breadth and specialization, geographic reach, proprietary networks, robust distribution capabilities and advanced technology contribute to our industry leading position.
executive overview we operate in two segments, which we refer to as our north america and international segments. our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services. in this report, we refer to this net revenue as "revenue". see "results of operations" for additional segment information.
we report our results from cambridge (acquired in the third quarter of 2017) and cls (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017) in our north america segment. the results of operations from the fuel card business acquired in russia are included within our international segment. as part of our plan to exit the telematics business, on july 27, 2017, we sold nextraq, a u.s. fleet telematics business, which has historically been included in our north america segment.

adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental non-gaap financial measures of operating performance. see the heading entitled "management's use of non-gaap financial measures." we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs. the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. thus, we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis. we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis.
sources of revenue transactions. in both of our segments, we derive revenue from transactions. a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer utilizing one of our payment products at a participating merchant. the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow, which is representative of many, but not all, of our businesses.

illustrative transaction flow the revenue we derive from transactions is generated from both customers and merchants. customers may include directly- and indirectly-sold commercial businesses as well as partners for whom we manage payment programs. merchants may include those merchants affiliated with our proprietary networks or those participating in the third-party networks we utilize.
from our customers and partners, we generate revenue through a variety of program fees, including transaction fees, card fees, network fees and charges. these fees may be charged as fixed amounts, costs plus a mark-up, or based on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts. our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk.
from our merchants and third-party networks, we generate revenue mostly from the difference between the amount charged to a customer and the amount paid to the merchant or network for a given transaction, as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses. the amount paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as (i) the merchant's wholesale product cost plus a markup; (ii) the transaction purchase amount less a percentage discount; or (iii) the transaction purchase amount less a fixed fee per unit. the following table provides illustrations of these three merchant payment models, which are representative of many, but not all, of our businesses.
illustrative merchant payment models i) cost plus mark-up:                                ii) percentage discount:                             iii) fixed fee:

mark-up                  0.05                        discount (3%)                         (0.09      )   fixed fee                          (0.09     )
price paid to merchant                $2.91          price paid to merchant                $2.91          price paid to merchant             $2.91
for a transaction involving the purchase of fuel where the amount paid to the merchant is calculated under the cost plus markup model, we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant as merchant revenue tied to fuel-price spreads. in all other cases, we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant for a given transaction as interchange revenue.
revenue per transaction. set forth below is revenue per transaction by segment information for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. revenue per transactions by segment is affected by the mix of products and acquisitions, which may result in revenue per transaction by product providing more meaningful data for analysis.

2 pro forma and macro adjusted revenue is a non-gaap financial measure defined as revenues, net adjusted for the impact of the macroeconomic environment and acquisitions and dispositions and other one-time items. we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as a basis to evaluate our organic growth. see the heading entitled "management's use of non-gaap financial measures" for a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenue by product, non-gaap measures, to the gaap equivalent.
32017 is adjusted to remove the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment to be consistent with the same period of prior year, using constant fuel prices, fuel price spreads and foreign exchange rates.
42016 is pro forma to include acquisitions and exclude dispositions consistent with 2017 ownership.
52016 revenue and transactions reflect immaterial corrections from previously disclosed amounts for the prior period.
6fuel cards product category further refined to fuel, to reflect different ways that fuel is paid for by our customers.
revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in our business, and the overall macroeconomic environment, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and spreads. revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases, as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates. see "results of operations" for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction.
sources of expense we incur expenses in the following categories:
•   merchant commissions-in certain of our card programs, we incur merchant commissions expense when we reimburse merchants with whom we have direct, contractual relationships for specific transactions where a customer purchases products or services from the merchant. in the card programs where it is paid, merchant commissions equal the difference between the price paid by us to the merchant and the merchant's wholesale cost of the underlying products or services.
•   processing-our processing expense consists of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing our customers and merchants, bad debt expense and cost of goods sold related to our hardware sales in certain businesses.
•   selling-our selling expenses consist primarily of wages, benefits, sales commissions (other than merchant commissions) and related expenses for our sales, marketing and account management personnel and activities.
•   general and administrative-our general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for our executive, finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel. also included are facilities expenses, third-party professional services fees, travel and entertainment expenses, and other corporate-level expenses.
•   depreciation and amortization-our depreciation expenses include depreciation of property and equipment, consisting of computer hardware and software (including proprietary software development amortization expense), card-reading equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles and buildings and leasehold improvements related to office space. our amortization expenses include amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships, trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements. we also amortize intangible assets related to business acquisitions and certain private label contracts associated with the purchase of accounts receivable.
•   other operating, net-our other operating, net includes other operating expenses and income items unusual to the period and presented separately.
•   investment loss (income)-our investment results relate to our minority interest in masternaut, a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe, which we historically accounted for using the equity method. on september 30, 2017, we entered into an amended masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence, and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method.
•   other (income) expense, net-our other (income) expense, net includes proceeds/costs from the sale of assets, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, and other miscellaneous operating costs and revenue.
53
•   interest expense, net-our interest expense, net includes interest income on our cash balances and interest expense on our outstanding debt and on our securitization facility. we have historically invested our cash primarily in short-term money market funds.
•   loss on extinguishment of debt-loss on extinguishment of debt relates to our write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility.
•   provision for income taxes-the provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our products and services. our worldwide effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35%, due primarily to the tax cuts and job act ("tax act") and lower rates in foreign jurisdictions and foreign-sourced non-taxable income.
factors and trends impacting our business we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance:
•   global economic conditions-our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, both in north america and internationally. factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes and the credit risk of our customers. these factors affected our businesses in both our north america and international segments.
•   foreign currency changes-our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency rates; namely, by movements of the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound, canadian dollar, czech koruna, euro, mexican peso, new zealand dollar and russian ruble, relative to the u.s. dollar. approximately 62%, 70% and 72% of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was derived in u.s. dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates. see "results of operations" for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue, net.
•   fuel prices-our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel. accordingly, our revenue is affected by fuel prices, which are subject to significant volatility. a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources, including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer's total purchase. changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the finance fees and charges based on these amounts. see "sources of revenue" above for further information related to the absolute price of fuel.
•   fuel-price spread volatility-a portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel-price spreads, which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction. in these transactions, the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel. the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described above affecting fuel prices. the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including, among others, the fuel price paid to the merchant, posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices. we experience fuel-price spread contraction when the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers, or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel. see "sources of revenue" above for further information related to fuel-price spreads.
•   acquisitions-since 2002, we have completed over 75 acquisitions of companies and commercial account portfolios. acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy, and it is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions. the impact of acquisitions has, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations and may make it difficult to compare our results between periods.
•   interest rates-our results of operations are affected by interest rates. we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt.
•   expenses- over the long term, we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases. to support our expected revenue growth, we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing, third-party agents, internet marketing, telemarketing and field sales force.

•   during 2016, we made additional investments of $7.9 million related to our investment at masternaut. we also received a $9.2 million return of our investment in masternaut in 2016.
during 2015, we completed acquisitions of shell portfolios related to our fuel card businesses in europe, as well as a small acquisition internationally, with an aggregate purchase price of $46.3 million, each included within our international segment from the date of acquisition, and made additional investments of $8.4 million related to our equity method investment at masternaut and deferred payments of $3.4 million related to acquisitions occurring in prior years.
we report our results from cambridge and cls acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively, in our north america segment, from the date of acquisition. the results of operations from the fuel card business in russia acquired in the third quarter of 2017, are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition. the results of operations from the fuel card portfolio acquired in the u.s. are included within our north america segment, from the date of acquisition. the results of operations of stp, the fuel card portfolio in the united kingdom, the additional shell markets, the travelcard business in the netherlands and the small business in brazil are included within our international segment, from the date of acquisition.
asset dispositions telematics businesses as part of our plan to exit the telematics business, on july 27, 2017, we sold nextraq, a u.s. fleet telematics business, to michelin group for $316.5 million. we recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of nextraq of $175.0 million during the third quarter of 2017, which is net of transaction closing costs. we recorded tax on the gain of disposal of $65.8 million. the gain on the disposal is included in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. nextraq had historically been included in our north america segment.
on september 30, 2017, we entered into an amended masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence, and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method.
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our masternaut investment and during the third quarter of 2017, we determined that the fair value of our 44% investment in masternaut had declined as a result of our loss of significant influence and the operating results of masternaut. as a result, we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value, and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary. we recorded a $44.6 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for $31.4 million of currency translation losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

revenues our consolidated revenue increased from $1,831.5 million in 2016 to $2,249.5 million in 2017, an increase of $418.0 million, or 22.8%. the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to:
•   the impact of acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017, which contributed approximately $212 million in additional revenue.
•   organic growth of approximately 9% on a constant fuel price, fuel spread margin, foreign currency and pro forma basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a favorable impact on our consolidated revenue for 2017 over 2016 of approximately $33 million. we believe the favorable impact of higher fuel prices and fuel spread margins, primarily in the u.s., had a favorable impact on consolidated revenues in 2017 over in 2016 of approximately $30 million. additionally, changes in foreign exchange

rates had a favorable impact on consolidated revenues in 2017 over in 2016 of approximately $3 million, primarily due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates in brazil.
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the disposition of the nextraq telematics business in july 2017 of $23 million.
north america segment revenues. north america revenues increased from $1,279.1 million in 2016 to $1,428.7 million in 2017, an increase of $149.6 million, or 11.7%. the increase in our north america segment revenue was primarily due to:
•   the impact of our cambridge and cls acquisitions during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively, which contributed approximately $51 million in additional revenue.
•   organic growth of approximately 8%, on a constant fuel price, fuel spread margin and pro forma basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a positive impact on our north america segment revenue in 2017 over in 2016 of approximately $26 million, primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in fuel prices and slightly higher fuel spread margins.
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of $23 million.
international segment revenue. international segment revenues increased from $552.4 million in 2016 to $820.8 million in 2017, an increase of $268.4 million, or 48.6%. the increase in our international segment revenue was primarily due to:
•   the impact of acquisitions during 2016 and 2017, which contributed approximately $161 million in additional revenue.
•   organic growth of approximately 11% on a constant macroeconomic and pro forma basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a positive impact on our international segment revenue for 2017 over 2016 of approximately $7 million, primarily due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates in brazil, as well as favorable impact of changes in fuel prices.
revenues by geography, product and source. set forth below are further breakdowns of revenue by geography, product and source for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions), which we believe is useful in understanding the results of our business.

consolidated operating expenses merchant commission. merchant commissions increased from $104.3 million in 2016 to $113.1 million in 2017, an increase of $8.8 million or 8.4%. this increase was primarily due to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel and the impact of higher volume in certain revenue streams where merchant commissions are paid.
processing. processing expenses increased from $355.4 million in 2016 to $429.6 million in 2017, an increase of $74.2 million or 20.9%. increases in processing expenses were primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $62 million, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of negotiated lower vendor processing costs. the increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired stp business. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $6 million.
selling. selling expenses increased from $131.4 million in 2016 to $170.7 million in 2017, an increase of $39.3 million or 29.9%. increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $26 million and additional spending in certain lines of business. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $2 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased from $283.6 million in 2016 to $387.7 million in 2017, an increase of $104.1 million or 36.7%. the increase was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $42 million, increased stock based compensation expense of approximately $30 million and increases in other professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $2 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $203.3 million in 2016 to $264.6 million in 2017, an increase of $61.3 million or 30.2%. the increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $47 million and increased capital spending. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $4 million.
investment loss. investment losses increased from $36.4 million in 2016 to $53.2 million in 2017. we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our masternaut investment and during the third quarter of 2017, we determined that the fair value of our 44% investment in masternaut had declined as a result of our loss of significant influence due to the amendment of the masternaut investment agreement, executed september 30, 2017, and the operating results of masternaut. as a result, we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value, and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary. we recorded a $44.6 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for $31.4 million of currency translation losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
other (income) expense, net. other income, net was $173.4 million in 2017, compared to other expense, net of $3.0 million in 2016. the increase was due primarily to the pre-tax gain on the sale of our nextraq business of $175 million in 2017.
interest expense, net. interest expense increased from $71.9 million in 2016 to $107.1 million in 2017, an increase of $35.3 million or 49.0%. the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings to finance the acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, share buybacks and increases in libor. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the related unused credit facility fees.

loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million relates to our write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility during the third quarter of 2017.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes decreased from $190.5 million in 2016 to $153.4 million in 2017, a decrease of $37.1 million or 19.5%, primarily driven by the impact of the enactment of the tax act, partially offset by the increase in pretax book income for 2017 as compared to 2016. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the tax act. the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the transition tax can be paid over eight years.
also, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. in accordance with sab 118, we have a one-year measurement period in which to complete our accounting for the tax act.
we have made an estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax, which resulted in a provisional net tax benefit of $128.2 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities after considering the u.s. federal income tax rate reduction to 21%. the one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from u.s. income taxes. in 2017, we recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax expense of $81.8 million, net of foreign tax credits.
net income. for the reasons discussed above, our net income increased from $452.4 million in 2016 to $740.2 million in 2017, an increase of $287.8 million or 63.6%, primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the tax act on earnings of approximately $127.5 million and the gain on the disposition of nextraq of $109.2 million, partially offset by incremental amortization expense, stock based compensation expense, impairment of our investment in masternaut and legal fees during 2017.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income. operating income increased from $754.2 million in 2016 to $883.8 million in 2017, an increase of $129.6 million or 17.2%. consolidated operating margin was 41.2% in 2016 and 39.3% in 2017. the increase in operating income was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017, organic growth, as well as the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $25 million, as previously discussed. these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $178 million, additional stock based compensation of approximately $30 million, higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately $8 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income. north america operating income increased from $506.4 million in 2016 to $541.6 million in 2017, an increase of $35.2 million, or 6.9%. north america operating margin was 39.6% in 2016 and 37.9% in 2017. the increase in operating income was due primarily to organic growth and the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $24 million, driven primarily by higher fuel prices. these increases were partially offset by additional stock based compensation of approximately $21 million, higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $50 million, higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately $8 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.
international segment operating income. international operating income increased from $247.7 million in 2016 to $342.2 million in 2017, an increase of $94.4 million, or 38.1%. international operating margin was 44.8% in 2016 and 41.7% in 2017. the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 and organic growth and the slightly positive impact of the macroeconomic environment. these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $128 million and additional stock based compensation of approximately $9 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.

nm = not meaningful revenues our consolidated revenue increased from $1,702.9 million in 2015 to $1,831.5 million in 2016, an increase of $128.7 million, or 7.6%. the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following:
•   the impact of acquisitions completed in 2016, which contributed approximately $87 million in additional revenue.
•   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven primarily by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
•   partially offsetting this growth was the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our consolidated revenue for 2016 over the comparable period in 2015 of approximately $109 million. we believe the impact of lower fuel prices, primarily in the u.s., and lower fuel spread margins, had an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately $66 million. additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately $43 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in most geographies in 2016 compared to 2015.

north america segment revenues. north america revenue increased from $1,232.0 million in 2015 to $1,279.1 million in 2016, an increase of $47.1 million, or 3.8%. the increase in our north america revenue was primarily due to:
•   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
•   partially offsetting the organic growth was the negative impact of macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our north america segment revenue in 2016 over the comparable period in 2015 of approximately $65 million, primarily due to the impact of lower fuel prices and lower fuel spread margins.
international segment revenue. international segment revenues increased from $470.9 million in 2015 to $552.4 million in 2016, an increase of $81.5 million, or 17.3%. the increase in our international segment revenue was primarily due to:
•   the impact of acquisitions during 2016, which contributed approximately $87 million in additional revenue.
•   organic growth in certain of our payment programs driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction.
•   partially offsetting this growth was the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment. although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our international segment revenue for 2016 over the comparable period in 2015 of approximately $44 million, primarily due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in most geographies where we do business and slightly lower fuel prices.

1 amounts shown for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect corrections in estimated allocation of revenue by product from previously disclosed amounts.
consolidated operating expenses merchant commission. merchant commissions decreased from $108.3 million in 2015 to $104.3 million in 2016, a decrease of$3.9 million, or 3.6%. this decrease was primarily due to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel, which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs, as well as the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
62
processing. processing expenses increased from $331.1 million in 2015 to $355.4 million in 2016, an increase of $24.3 million, or 7.4%. increases in processing expenses were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and incremental bad debt expense, partially offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and lower negotiated vendor processing costs.
selling. selling expenses increased from $109.1 million in 2015 to $131.4 million in 2016, an increase of $22.4 million, or 20.5%. increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets, partially offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense decreased from $297.7 million in 2015 to $283.6 million in 2016, a decrease of $14.1 million, or 4.7%. the decrease was primarily due to decreased stock based compensation of approximately $26 million from the comparable period in 2015 and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and an incremental $2 million in acquisition related expenses over 2015.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $193.5 million in 2015 to $203.3 million in 2016, an increase of $9.8 million, or 5.1%. the increase was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016, partially offset by movements in and adjustments from changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately $2 million.
other operating, net. other operating, net decreased from $4.2 million in 2015 to $0.7 million in 2016. the decrease is due to favorable reversals of various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db trans s.a. ("db") and vb in brazil in 2015.
investment loss. losses at our equity method investment decreased from $57.7 million in 2015 to $36.4 million in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $13.8 million during 2016, as well as less costs incurred to restructure the operations of the business and a smaller impairment of our investment, compared to 2015.
we regularly evaluate our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other than temporary impairment in accordance with u. s. gaap. during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives planned at masternaut were more challenging to implement than we originally projected. as a result, we recorded a $36.1 million non-cash impairment charge in our equity method investment in 2016, compared to a $40 million charge in 2015.
interest expense, net. interest expense was $71.3 million in 2015 compared to $71.9 million in 2016. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the relevant unused credit facility fees.

the average unused credit facility fee for domestic revolver a was 0.31% and 0.35% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes increased from $173.6 million in 2015 to $190.5 million in 2016, an increase of $17.0 million, or 9.8%. the increase in income taxes from 2015 to 2016 was primarily driven by the increase in book earnings for 2016 as compared to 2015. the increase in taxes was partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 32.4% in 2015 to 29.7% in 2016. the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the adoption of asu 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation: improvements to employee share-based payment accounting", which resulted in excess tax benefits being recorded as a reduction of income tax expense during 2016, rather than additional paid in capital as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote. we also had a non-recurring net gain recorded by our equity method investment, which favorably impacted pre-tax earnings but was not subject to u.s. income taxes and the impact of certain tax planning initiatives that were implemented during 2016. we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions, including the u.s., most u.s. states and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. the tax rates in certain non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions are
63
lower than the u.s. tax rate. consequently, as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions, our effective tax rate fluctuates.
net income. for the reasons discussed above, our net income increased from $362.4 million in 2015 to $452.4 million in 2016, an increase of $90.0 million, or 24.8%.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income. operating income increased from $667.5 million in 2015 to $754.2 million in 2016, an increase of $86.6 million, or 13.0%. consolidated operating margin was 39.2% in 2015 and 41.2% in 2016. the increase in operating income was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2016, $26 million less stock based compensation expense compared to 2015 and organic growth in the business, partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $82 million, driven by lower fuel prices and spreads, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income. north america operating income increased from $442.0 million in 2015 to $506.4 million in 2016, an increase of $64.4 million, or 14.6%. north america operating margin was 35.9% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2016. the increase in operating income was due primarily to less stock based compensation expense compared to 2015 and organic growth in the business, partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $56 million, driven by lower fuel prices and lower fuel spread margins.
international segment operating income. international operating income increased from $225.5 million in 2015 to $247.7 million in 2016, an increase of $22.3 million, or 9.9%. international operating margin was 47.9% in 2015 and 44.8% in 2016. the increase in operating income was due primarily to acquisitions completed in 2016 and organic growth in the business, partially offset by the approximately $26 million unfavorable impact of the macroeconomic environment, specifically unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as the negative impact of fuel prices internationally. the impact of changes in fuel price spreads was negligible.
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness, make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios, repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital, tax and capital expenditure needs.
sources of liquidity. at december 31, 2017, our cash balances totaled $1,130.9 million, with approximately $217.3 million restricted. restricted cash represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the u.s., as well as collateral received from customers for cross-currency transactions in our cambridge business, which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits, as well as secure and settle cross-currency transactions.
at december 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested was $556.1 million. all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, excluding restricted cash, are available for general corporate purposes. our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth, to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time. we currently believe that funds generated from our u.s. operations, along with available borrowing capacity in the u.s. will be sufficient to fund our u.s. operations for the foreseeable future, and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our u.s. operations.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax act, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. we have provisionally recorded an $81.8 million charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. as permitted by the tax act, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018. we are currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided deferred taxes for foreign withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. the amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material.

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables, to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital. we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable. as a result, we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances. these balances are primarily composed of charge balances, which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly, semimonthly or monthly basis, and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing. we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions. at december 31, 2017, we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility. at december 31, 2017, we had approximately $615 million available under our credit facility.
based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, we believe that our current cash balances, our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. however, we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity securities. we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.

operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $705.9 million in 2016 to $675.7 million in 2017. operating cash flows were primarily affected by higher net income, the gain on the sale of our nextraq business in 2017 (treated as an investing activity) and deferred income taxes resulting from enactment of the tax act. also included in cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2017 over the comparable period in 2016.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $754.6 million in 2015 to $705.9 million in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital driven by fluctuations in receivables and payables, largely due to timing of month end transactions and volume. cash flow was favorably impacted by additional net income of $90 million during 2016 over the comparable period in 2015.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $497.8 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions and the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business during the third quarter of 2017.
net cash used in investing activities increased from $99.4 million in 2015 to $1,389.6 million in 2016. this increase was primarily due to the increase in cash paid for our stp and travelcard acquisitions completed in 2016.
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities decreased from $754.0 million in 2016 to $251.9 million in 2017. the decrease is primarily due to additional repayments on our credit facility of $599.8 million in 2017 over 2016, and increased spending to repurchase our common stock of $214.7 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $243 million on our securitization facility and an increase in borrowings of $55.5 million on our credit facility.
net cash from financing activities increased from net cash used of $648.1 million in 2015 to net cash provided of $754.0 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term loans of $952.2 million and $585.0 million, respectively, to fund acquisitions during 2016.
65
capital spending summary our capital expenditures increased from $59.0 million in 2016 to $70.1 million in 2017, an increase of $11 million or 18.8%. this increase is primarily due to increased spending on strategic projects, including continued investment in our operating systems, as well as incremental spending related to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.
our capital expenditures increased from $41.9 million in 2015 to $59.0 million in 2016, an increase of $17 million or 40.9%. this increase was primarily due to increased spending on strategic projects, including continued investment in our gfn application.

stock repurchase program on february 4, 2016, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "program") under which we may purchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock over the following 18 months period. on july 27, 2017, our board of directors authorized an increase in the size of the program by an additional $250 million and an extension of the program by an additional 18 months. on november 1, 2017, we announced that our board of directors had authorized an additional increase in the size of the program by an another $350 million, resulting in total aggregate repurchases authorized under the program of $1.1 billion. with the increase and giving effect to $590.1 million of previous repurchases, we may repurchase up to $510 million in shares of our common stock at any time prior to february 1, 2019.
any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate. the timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess. any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business, working capital and debt.
on august 3, 2017, as part of the program, we entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("asr agreement") with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $250 million of our common stock. pursuant to the asr agreement, we delivered $250 million in cash and received 1,491,647 shares based on a stock price of $142.46 on august 7, 2017. the asr agreement was completed on september 7, 2017, at which time the we received 263,012 additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of $142.48.
we accounted for the asr agreement as two separate transactions: (i) as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us upon effectiveness of the asr agreement and (ii) as a forward contract indexed to our common stock for the undelivered shares. the initial delivery of shares was included in treasury stock at cost and results in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. the forward contracts indexed to our own common stock met the criteria for equity classification, and these amounts were initially recorded in additional paid-in capital and then reclassified to treasury stock upon completion of the asr agreement.
since the beginning of the program, 4,114,104 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $590.1 million have been repurchased. there were 2,854,959 common shares totaling $402.4 million repurchased under the program during 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. in many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.
see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements, summary of significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition and presentation. revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships, as well as from customers and partners. we recognize revenue on fees generated through services primarily to commercial fleets, commercial businesses, major oil companies, petroleum marketers and leasing companies and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following: (i) we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product; (ii) we have no inventory risk, do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications; (iii) we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product and (iv) the amount we earn for our services is fixed, within a limited range. we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships, processing and other arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as more fully described below.
68
through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel, prepaid cards, vehicle maintenance, lodging, food, toll, and transportation related services to our customers. we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction. our revenue consists of margin on sales and fees for technical support, processing, communications and reporting. the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as (i) the merchant's wholesale cost of the product plus a markup; (ii) the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount; or (iii) the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit. the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant's wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed. we have entered into agreements with major oil companies, petroleum marketers and leasing companies, among others, that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records.
we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees, card fees, network fees, service fees, report fees and other transaction-based fees, which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed, number of transactions processed, or some combination thereof. such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of third-party networks. transaction fees and other transaction-based fees generated from our proprietary networks and third-party networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured. card fees, network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations. in addition, we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges, in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations, primarily in the u.s. and canada. such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed. the company ceases billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30-40 days after the customer's balance becomes delinquent.
we also charge our customers transaction fees to load value onto prepaid fuel, food, toll and transportation vouchers and cards. we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel, food, toll and transportation vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer. revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is provided. revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment and cards in certain of our businesses, which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed. this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues, net within the consolidated statements of income. the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses in the consolidated statements of income. we have recorded $96.8 million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in 2017. sales commissions paid to personnel are expensed as incurred.
we deliver both stored value cards and card-based services primarily in the form of gift cards. for multiple-deliverable customer contracts, stored value cards and card-based services are separated into two units of accounting. stored valued cards are generally recognized upon shipment to the customer. card-based services are recognized when the card services are rendered.
we present taxes assessed by the government imposed concurrent with a revenue producing transaction between us and our customers (e.g. vat) on a net basis within revenues, net.
our fiscal year ends on december 31. in certain of our u.k. businesses, we record the operating results using a 4-4-5 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31.
accounts receivable. as described above under the heading "securitization facility," we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility. the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is $950 million. accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the u.s. pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility, we transfer certain of our domestic receivables, on a revolving basis, to fleetcor funding llc (funding), a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary. in turn, funding sells, without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $950 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit (conduit). funding maintains a subordinated interest, in the form of over collateralization, in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit. purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly-rated commercial paper.
we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing, to reduce our overall borrowing costs. we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates, which approximates our cost of servicing. we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit
69
enhancement. the residual interest's fair value approximates carrying value due to its short-term nature. funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable, subject to a maximum amount.
the company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt, including interest income, fees generated from late payments, provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense. the cash flows from borrowings and repayments, associated with the securitized debt, are presented as cash flows from financing activities.
foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $811 million and $591 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility.
credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables. we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers. payments from customers are generally due within 14 days or less of billing. we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances. accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible once they age past 90 days and are deemed uncollectible from the customer. we also provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience including accounts that have filed for bankruptcy. at december 31, 2017, approximately 96% of outstanding accounts receivable were current. accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a third-party collection agency. recoveries from the third-party collection agency are not significant.
impairment of long-lived assets, intangibles and investments. we test our long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance. we evaluate if impairment indicators related to our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. if impairment indicators are present, we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or asset group. the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with management's intended actions. if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we determine the assets' fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. generally, we perform our testing of the asset group at the business-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps, as well as a qualitative assessment, as appropriate. we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units. in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate: the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets; industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation; events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets, likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business; the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers; and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year, updated with current year results, weighted-average cost of capital rates and future projections.
in step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units, the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as
70
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss.
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. we discounted the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate.
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. significant changes in forecasts, the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively on october 1, 2017, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value. no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually. we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate, royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth and projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.
we also regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other-than-temporary impairment. we estimate the fair value of our investments using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of our investments in developing the valuation estimate.
on september 30, 2017, we entered into an amended masternaut group holdings limited ("masternaut") investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence, and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method. we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investment and during the third quarter of 2017, we determined that the fair value of our 44% investment in masternaut had declined as a result of our loss of significant influence. as a result, we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value, and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary. we recorded a $44.6 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for $31.4 million of currency losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, in the year ended december 31, 2017, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. during the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, we determined that the performance improvement initiatives in our investment in masternaut were taking longer to and were more challenging to implement than originally projected, based on revised cash flow projections provided by the business. as a result, we recorded a $36.1 million and $40 million non-cash impairment charge in its masternaut investment for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
income taxes. we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
71
settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible. we evaluate on a quarterly basis, whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established.
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. under the relevant authoritative literature, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, the u.s. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the tax act. as a result of tax act, the u.s. federal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. the tax act also includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. we have provisionally recorded a $210 million deferred tax benefit for the benefit for the corporate rate reduction on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. additionally, in 2017, we have provisionally recorded an $81.8 million charge on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. we are currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided deferred taxes for foreign withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. the amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material. if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the u.s., or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions may be required. see note 11 for further information regarding income taxes.
business combinations. business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income. for significant acquisitions, we obtain independent third-party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction.
estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when, and if, information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded. the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period, the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted. should information become available after the allocation period, those items are adjusted through operating results. the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses. certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition. contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition, and is remeasured each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. we estimate the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration using various valuation approaches, as well as significant unobservable inputs, reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities.
stock-based compensation. we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors. options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance. stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted. we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options. option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence. we base the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon u.s. treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
72
value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered.
awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time, performance or market conditions, or a combination of these. shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to three years. the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock.
for performance-based restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards, we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.
derivatives. with our acquisition of cambridge in august 2017, we use derivatives to facilitate cross-currency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers, which are not designated as hedging instruments. the majority of cambridge's revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. in addition, cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for its customers to facilitate future payments. the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including forwards, options and spot exchanges of currency, and hedges (economic hedge) the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. the changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in revenues, net in the consolidated statements of income.
we recognize all derivatives in "prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, the company's management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
tax act. the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, "income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act" ("sab 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740. in accordance with sab 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete. to the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act.
revenue recognition. in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)". the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap and permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. the update requires significant additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. asu 2014-09, as amended by asu 2015-14, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date", is effective for years beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted for years beginning after december 15, 2016. since the issuance of asu 2014-09, the fasb has issued additional interpretive guidance, including new accounting standards updates, that clarifies certain points of the standard and modifies certain requirements.
we have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and we are monitoring the activity of the fasb and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance. we have established an implementation team to assess the effects of the new revenue standard in a multi-phase approach. in the first phase, we analyzed customer contracts for our most significant contract categories, applied the five-step model of topic 606 to each contract category and comparing the
73
results to our current accounting practices. the second phase, which includes quantifying the potential effects identified during the first phase, assessing additional contract categories and principal versus agent considerations, revising accounting policies and considering the effects on related disclosures and/or internal control over financial reporting is ongoing and expected to be concluded during the first quarter of 2018.
topic 606 could change the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our arrangement types. in addition, it could also increase the administrative burden on our operations to account for customer contracts and provide the more expansive required disclosures. more judgment and estimates may be required within the process of applying the requirements of the new standard than are required under existing gaap, such as identifying performance obligations in contracts, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in transaction price, allocating transaction price to each separate performance obligation and estimating expected customer lives. we are in the process of finalizing our assessment and completing the quantification of the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures and/or internal control over financial reporting. this conclusion will be made over the remainder of the first quarter of 2018 and will include finalizing our evaluation of the application of the principal vs. agent guidance, specifically as it relates to products where we utilize a third-party payment network and in certain businesses where we pay merchant commissions. however, our preliminary view is that the expected amount and timing of revenue to be recognized under topic 606 for our most significant contract categories, fuel card payments, lodging payments, toll payments, corporate payments, and gift cards, will be similar to the amount and timing of revenue recognized under our current accounting practices, except as it relates to the presentation of certain costs where we may be determined to be an agent in the processing relationship under the new guidance, resulting in recording such costs as a reduction of revenue. we will be required to capitalize additional costs to obtain contracts with customers, and, in some cases, may be required to amortize these costs over a contractual time period. finally, we expect disclosures about our revenues and related customer acquisition costs to be more extensive.
we plan to adopt topic 606, as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the fasb related to this new revenue standard, effective january 1, 2018. we will apply the modified retrospective transition method, which would result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect, if any, of applying the standard to contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application. under this method, we would not restate the prior financial statements presented, therefore the new standard requires us to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period during 2018, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes, if any.
accounting for leases. in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases", which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases. this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018 and interim periods therein. early adoption is permitted. the new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements; however, we expect to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for operating leases in the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption.
accounting for breakage. in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-04, "liabilities-extinguishments of liabilities: recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products", which requires entities that sell prepaid stored value products redeemable for goods, services or cash at third-party merchants to derecognize liabilities related to those products for breakage. this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. the asu must be adopted using either a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption or a full retrospective approach. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
cash flow classification. in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments", which amends the guidance in asc 230, statement of cash flows. this amended guidance reduces the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. this asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable.our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash", which amends the guidance in asc 230, statement of cash flows, on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. this asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. the amendments in this asu should be applied using a retrospective transition method to
74
each period presented. we do not believe the adoption of this asu will impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
intangibles - goodwill and other impairment. in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "simplifying the test for goodwill impairment", which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., step 2 of the goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on step 1). the standard has tiered effective dates, starting in 2020 for calendar-year public business entities that meet the definition of an sec filer. early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1, 2017. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, unless a goodwill impairment is identified.
definition of a business. in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01, "clarifying the definition of a business", which amends the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. the guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. the guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs. the guidance is effective for the reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, however it could result in accounting for acquisitions as asset acquisitions versus business combinations upon adoption.
accounting for modifications to stock-based compensation. in may 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): scope of modification accounting", which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. the asu provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under asc 718. specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
accounting for derivative financial instruments. in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities", which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in asc 815. the fasb issued accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with a company's risk management activities, simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements. the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

______________________
75
(a)   deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2017 were approximately $517.1 million. refer to note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. at december 31, 2017, we had approximately $31.6 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. we cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. we do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.
(b)   we draw upon and pay down on the revolver within our credit agreement and our securitization facility borrowings outside of a normal schedule, as excess cash is available. for our variable rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2017 interest rates to calculate the estimated interest payments, for all years presented. this analysis also assumes that outstanding principal is held constant at the december 31, 2017 balances for our credit agreement and securitization facility, except for mandatory pay downs on the term loans in accordance with the loan documents. we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or other short-term borrowings.
(c)   the long-term portion of contingent consideration agreements and deferred purchase price payments are included with 'other debt' in the detail of our debt instruments disclosed in note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. to reconcile the amount of 'other debt' as disclosed in the footnote to the contractual obligations table above, the long-term portion of deferred purchase price payments should be combined with 'other'.
management's use of non-gaap financial measures we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap. any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. below, we define the non-gaap financial measures, provide a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap, and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors.
adjusted revenues. we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues, net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement.
we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs. the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis. adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.
set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure, revenues, net (in millions):

pro forma and macro adjusted revenues. we have defined the non-gaap measure pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenues, net adjusted for the impact of the macroeconomic environment, acquisitions and dispositions and other one-time items. we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as a basis to evaluate our organic growth.

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment, (c) a non-recurring net gain at equity method investment, (d) impairment of our equity method investment, (e) net gain on disposition of business, (f) loss on extinguishment of debt and, (g) other non-recurring items, including the impact of the tax act.
we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income.
we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. we believe it is useful to exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance. we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income. we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis. adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.

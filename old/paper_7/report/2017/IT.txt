business measurements we believe that the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments:
business segment   business measurements research           total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts. it is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. total contract value primarily includes research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, as well as other deliverables (primarily events tickets) for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized.
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. client retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.
wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year ago, by the total contract value from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. when wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.
consulting         consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting and measurement engagements.
utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill.
billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours.
average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year.
events             number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. single day, local events are excluded.
number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events. single day, local events are excluded.

executive summary of operations and financial position we have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive revenue and earnings growth. the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. we also continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. during 2017, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our outstanding common stock and we acquired ceb, an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights, and l2, inc. ("l2"), a subscription-based research business that benchmarks the digital performance of brands. note 2 - acquisitions and divestiture in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding these acquisitions.
we had total revenues of $3.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 35% over 2016 on both a reported basis and adjusted for foreign exchange impact. on a reported basis, ceb contributed $522.9 million of the increase in total revenues. net income declined to $3.3 million in 2017 from $193.6 million in 2016 and, as a result, diluted earnings per share was $0.04 in 2017 compared to $2.31 in 2016. see note 10 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning the net favorable impact of $59.6 million on the company's 2017 income tax provision from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017.
research revenues increased to $2.5 billion during 2017, or 33% compared to 2016 on both a reported basis and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. heritage gartner revenues increased $304.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, which represents a 16% increase on a reported basis, with approximately one point of the increase due to l2, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2017. adjusted for the foreign exchange impact, heritage gartner revenues also increased by 16% year-over-year. on a reported basis, ceb contributed $309.6 million of the 2017 increase in research revenues. the research gross contribution margin declined by two points during 2017, primarily due to the impact of the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment resulting from the ceb acquisition. heritage gartner client retention and wallet retention both remained strong at 84% and 106%, respectively, as of december 31, 2017.
consulting revenues increased to $327.7 million in 2017, or 3% compared to 2016 on both a reported basis and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. the consulting gross contribution margin was 29% in 2017 compared to 28% in 2016. consultant utilization was 64% and 66% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. we had 682 billable consultants at december 31, 2017 compared to 628 at december 31, 2016. backlog was $95.2 million at december 31, 2017.
events revenues increased to $337.9 million in 2017, or 26% compared to 2016 on a reported basis and 25% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. heritage gartner revenues increased $30.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, an 11% increase on a reported basis and 10% adjusted for the foreign exchange impact. ceb contributed $38.6 million of the revenue increase on a reported basis. the heritage gartner events gross contribution margin was 49% and 51% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. in the heritage gartner business, we held 65 events and 66 events in 2017 and 2016, respectively, while the number of attendees for 2017 increased 17% and exhibitors increased 3% compared to 2016, with average revenue per exhibitor up by 5% while average revenue per attendee was flat. ceb held four events during 2017 with 3,578 attendees.
as a result of the ceb acquisition, we added a new reportable segment in second quarter 2017 called talent assessment & other, which contributed $174.7 million of revenues during 2017.
for a more complete discussion of our results by segment, see segment results below.
cash provided by operating activities was $254.5 million and $365.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we had $538.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes amounts deemed to be held-for-sale, and $558.0 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. for a more complete discussion of our cash flows and financial position, see liquidity and capital resources below.
fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly and annual revenues, operating income (loss) and cash flows fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our symposium/itxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth quarter, as well as our other events; the timing and amount of new business generated, including from acquisitions; the mix of domestic and international business; domestic and international economic conditions; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; the payment of performance compensation; and other factors that are beyond our control. the potential fluctuations in our operating income (loss) could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below.
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. however, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. in addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and, as such, these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.
our critical accounting policies pertaining to the years presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k are as follows:
revenue recognition - revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of u.s. gaap, as well as sec staff accounting bulletin no. 104, revenue recognition. revenue is only recognized when all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:
•   research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors.
•   consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.
•   events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition.
•   talent assessment &amp; other revenues arising from knowledge and skill assessment services are recognized depending on the nature of the underlying contract: (i) ratably over the term of the service period; (ii) upon delivery; or (iii) on a proportional performance basis. revenues from training programs and survey and questionnaire products are primarily recognized upon delivery of the service.
the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. all research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. it is our policy to record the amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.
the company adopted financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards update no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," on january 1, 2018. see note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of this accounting standard and its impact on the company's revenue recognition policies.
uncollectible fees receivable - we maintain an allowance for losses that is comprised of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. the determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients and probable losses. this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. the valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients' liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients' ability to pay their obligations as they come due and the effectiveness of our collection efforts.
21
the following table presents our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands):
december 31,
2017                                        2016
total fees receivable      $1,189,543              $650,413
allowance for losses          (12,700   )            (7,400   )
fees receivable, net       $1,176,843              $643,013
goodwill and other intangible assets - when we acquire a business, we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition, which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships, software, content and other intangible assets, as well as resulting goodwill. when determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, we consider, among other factors, analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. the fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows. this method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. we consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of the acquired intangible assets is their ability to generate future income. in a typical acquisition, we engage a third-party valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets.
determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment. we select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, including, but not limited to, marketplace participants, consumer awareness and brand history. additionally, there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges. specifically, the discount rates used in discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets.
determining an acquired intangible asset's useful life requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the expected use of the asset, historical client retention rates, consumer awareness and trade name history, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life.
the company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. in addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value.
fasb asc topic 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two approaches. both methods utilize estimates which, in turn, require judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. as a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. if our goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge. among the factors that we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. a quantitative analysis requires management to consider each of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the company's weighted average cost of capital and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units. we conducted a qualitative assessment of the fair value of all of the company's reporting units during the quarter ended september 30, 2017. the results of this test determined that the fair values of the company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values and as a result, no goodwill impairment was indicated. see note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes - the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. in assessing the realizability of
22
deferred tax assets, we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this assessment, we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position.
accounting for stock-based compensation - the company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no. 107 and no. 110. the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period (see note 8 - stock-based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information). determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of a stock-based compensation award and the company's common stock price volatility. in addition, determining the appropriate periodic stock-based compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock-based compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. as a result, if circumstances change and the company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the company's stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.
restructuring and other accruals - we may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. these accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. in addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. we also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year.

cost of services and product development was $1.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $374.6 million compared to 2016, or 40% on both a reported basis and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. approximately $238.0 million of the increase was attributable to ceb. the $136.6 million increase attributable to heritage gartner was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from increased headcount, which increased 20%. cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenues was 40% and 39% for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense was $1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of $509.8 million compared to 2016, or 47% on both a reported basis and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. approximately $283.8 million of the increase was attributable to ceb. heritage gartner sg&a costs for 2017 increased $226.0 million, primarily due to $107.4 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs, reflecting a 17% overall headcount increase; $33.8 million in higher commissions due to increased sales bookings; and $84.8 million in higher corporate costs and foreign exchange impact. the overall headcount growth includes a 16% increase in quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 2,807 at december 31, 2017 from 2,423 at december 31, 2016.
depreciation increased $26.7 million during 2017 when compared to 2016, due to property, equipment and leasehold improvements acquired with ceb and additional heritage gartner investment.
amortization of intangibles increased $151.5 million during 2017 when compared to 2016 due to additional amortization from the intangibles recorded in connection with our recent acquisitions.
acquisition and integration charges increased $115.9 million during 2017 when compared to 2016. this increase reflects the additional charges resulting from our recent acquisitions and primarily consist of higher professional fees, severance, stock-based compensation charges and accruals for exit costs for certain office space that the company does not intend to occupy in arlington, virginia.
operating (loss) income was an operating loss of $(6.3) million during 2017 compared to operating income of $305.1 million in 2016. the decline reflects several factors. we had a lower segment contribution margin in our research business resulting from a ceb deferred revenue fair value adjustment. we also had higher sg&a and acquisition-related costs, including depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition and integration charges.
interest expense, net increased $99.8 million during 2017 when compared to 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher borrowings during 2017.
other income, net was $3.4 million during 2017, primarily reflecting the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. other income, net was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the state of connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities.
(benefit) provision for income taxes in 2017 was a benefit of $(131.1) million on a pretax loss of $(127.8) million compared to an expense of $94.8 million on pretax income of $288.4 million in 2016. the effective income tax rate was 102.6% in 2017 compared to 32.9% in 2016. the change in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of u.s. tax reform, the recognition in 2017 of unrealized capital losses on the planned divestiture of the talent assessment business, and increases in tax benefits associated with equity compensation.
net income was $3.3 million and $193.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. the year-over-year change primarily reflects declines in our operating profitability and higher interest expense, partially offset by income tax benefits in 2017, including the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. as a result of substantially lower net income and a 7% increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding, diluted earnings per share declined to $0.04 in 2017 from $2.31 in 2016.

please refer to the section of this md&a below entitled "segment results" for a discussion of revenues and results by segment.
cost of services and product development ("cos") increased $106.6 million, or 13%, in 2016 compared to 2015, to $945.6 million compared to $839.1 million in 2015. cos increased 14% in 2016 when compared to 2015 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. the year-over-year increase in cos was due to $88.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $28.6 million in higher charges in 2016 for events costs and other program related expenses. partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $10.0 million in foreign exchange impact. overall cos headcount increased 13%, which was primarily in our research segment. cos as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both 2016 and 2015.

selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense increased by $126.5 million in 2016, or 13%, to $1,089.2 million compared to $962.7 million in 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, sg&a expense increased 15% year-over-year. the increase was primarily due to $115.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.5 million in additional legal, recruiting and training, and workplace costs. partially offsetting these additional charges was approximately $16.0 million in foreign exchange impact. sg&a headcount increased 13% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. quota-bearing sales associates increased 12% year-over-year, to 2,423 at december 31, 2016 from 2,171 at december 31, 2015.
depreciation increased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets.
amortization of intangibles increased to $24.8 million in 2016 from $13.3 million in 2015 due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.
acquisition and integration charges were $42.6 million in 2016 compared to $26.2 million in 2015. these charges are directly related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting and severance costs.
operating income increased 6% in 2016 compared to 2015, to $305.1 million in 2016 from $288.0 million in 2015. operating income as a percentage of revenues was 12% in 2016 and 13% in 2015 with the decline due to a number of factors, to include lower gross contribution margins in our consulting and events segments and higher charges from acquisitions.
interest expense, net increased 21% year-over-year due to higher average borrowings in 2016.
other income, net was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the state of connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities. other income, net was $5.0 million in 2015, which consisted of a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits, partially offset by a net loss from foreign currency hedging activities.
(benefit) provision for income taxes was $94.8 million in 2016 compared to $96.6 million in 2015 and the effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2016 compared to 35.5% in 2015. the decrease in the 2016 effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the early adoption of fasb asu no. 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting," partially offset by increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions.
net income was $193.6 million in 2016 and $175.6 million in 2015, an increase of 10%. diluted earnings per share increased 12% year-over-year, to $2.31 in 2016 compared to $2.06 in 2015 due to higher net income and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the number of weighted average shares outstanding in 2016.

segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. gross contribution is defined as operating income (loss), excluding certain cost of services and product development charges, sg&a expenses, depreciation, acquisition and integration charges, and amortization of intangibles. gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.
on april 5, 2017, gartner completed its acquisition of ceb. with the ceb acquisition, gartner began reporting four business segments reflecting the company's enlarged scale and breadth of advisory services. the company's reportable segments are as follows:
•   research provides trusted, objective insights and advice on the mission-critical priorities of leaders across all functional areas of the enterprise through research and other reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions. gartner's traditional strengths in it, marketing and supply chain research were enhanced in 2017 with gartner's acquisition of ceb, inc., which added ceb's best practice and talent management research insights across a range of business functions, to include human resources, sales, legal and finance.
•   consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving it performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency and quality.
•   events provides business professionals across the organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. from our flagship cio event gartner symposium/itxpo, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to member-driven sessions, our events enable attendees to experience the best of gartner insight and advice live.
•   talent assessment &amp; other helps organizations assess, engage, manage and improve talent. this is accomplished through knowledge and skills assessments, training programs, workshops, and survey and questionnaire services.
the sections below present the results of these four reportable business segments. references to "heritage gartner" operating results and business measurements below refer to gartner excluding ceb. references to "ceb" operating results and business measurements below refer to ceb subsequent to the acquisition.

2017 versus 2016
research segment revenues increased $614.3 million on a reported basis during 2017 compared to 2016, or 33% on both a reported basis and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. heritage gartner revenues increased $304.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, which represents a 16% increase on a reported basis, with approximately one point of the increase due to l2, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2017. adjusted for the foreign exchange impact, heritage gartner revenues also increased by 16% year-over-year. on a reported basis, ceb contributed $309.6 million of the 2017 increase in research segment revenues. the gross contribution margin declined by two points during 2017, primarily due to the impact of the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment resulting from the ceb acquisition.
heritage gartner total contract value was $2.2 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of 15% as reported and 16% on a foreign exchange neutral basis compared to december 31, 2016. heritage gartner client retention was 84% as of both december 31, 2017 and 2016, while wallet retention was 106% and 104% at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. heritage gartner total contract value at december 31, 2017 increased by double-digits across all of the company's sales regions and client sizes and virtually every industry segment compared to december 31, 2016. we increased the number of our research client enterprises by 7% in 2017. as of december 31, 2017, ceb contract value was $557.0 million and wallet retention was 96%.
2016 versus 2015
research segment revenues increased 15% in 2016 compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, research revenues increased approximately 17% in 2016. the segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. the contribution margin remained at 69% in 2016 despite a 14% increase in segment headcount, which was mostly driven by new hires and, to a lesser extent, the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. the headcount increase reflects our continued investment in this business. total contract value increased 9% on a reported basis in 2016 to $1.9 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. the growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region and client size and virtually every industry sector growing at double-digit percentage rates. we increased the number of our research client enterprises by 3% in 2016 to 11,122. both client retention and wallet retention remained strong at 84% and 104%, respectively, as of december 31, 2016.

2017 versus 2016
consulting revenues increased 3% during 2017 compared to 2016 on both a reported basis and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange, with revenue improvements in both core consulting and contract optimization. gross contribution margin was 29% and 28% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. the margin improvement in 2017 was primarily due to additional contract optimization revenue, which has a higher contribution margin than our labor-based core consulting, partially offset by lower consultant utilization and our investment in additional managing partners. backlog increased by $6.6 million, or 7%, year-over-year. the $95.2 million of backlog at december 31, 2017 represented approximately four months of backlog, which is in line with the company's operational target.
2016 versus 2015
consulting revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $318.9 million, with the increase mostly in our core consulting practice. additionally, revenue in our contract optimization practice increased slightly during 2016 compared to 2015. the impact of foreign currency exchange was not significant. the year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by one point due to several factors, including higher payroll costs resulting from higher headcount and severance. backlog decreased by $12.2 million year-over-year, or 12%, mostly due to a large individual contract booked in 2015. excluding that contract, backlog decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. the $88.6 million of backlog at december 31, 2016 represented approximately four months of forward backlog, which is in line with the company's operational target.

2017 versus 2016
events revenues increased $69.3 million, or 26%, during 2017 compared to 2016 on a reported basis and 25% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. heritage gartner revenues increased $30.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, an 11% increase on a reported basis and 10% adjusted for the foreign exchange impact, as both attendee and exhibitor increased, with attendee revenue growing at double-digits. we held 65 events in 2017 in the heritage gartner business, with a 17% increase in the number of attendees and a 3% increase in exhibitors compared to 2016, while the average revenue per exhibitor was up by 5% and average revenue per attendee was flat. ceb contributed $38.6 million of the revenue increase with four events held with 3,578 attendees. the segment gross contribution margin declined 3 points in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by additional investment in headcount and higher program expenses in heritage gartner, and to a lesser extent, a dilutive effect from the ceb events.
2016 versus 2015
events revenues increased $16.8 million, or 7%, when comparing 2016 to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, revenues increased 6% year-over-year. we held 66 events in 2016, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 7 new events, compared to 65 events in 2015. the year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our on-going events, which increased 9%, while attendee revenue increased 2%. the number of attendees in 2016 increased 4% to 54,602. average revenue per attendee declined slightly while average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. the gross contribution margin decreased one point year-over-year.

liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings (note 5 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company's 2016 credit agreement and other outstanding debt obligations). at december 31, 2017, we had $538.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $558.0 million of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility portion of our 2016 credit agreement. we believe that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its currently anticipated needs, to include the payment of the transition tax liability related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. note 10 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides information related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017.
we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained and enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model in our research segment, which is our largest business segment. revenues in our research segment increased 33% in 2017 compared to 2016, and constituted 75% of our total revenues in both 2017 and 2016. the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume.
as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $194.0 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our non-u.s. subsidiaries. our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. at december 31, 2017, 97% of our cash and cash equivalents was held overseas, with a substantial portion representing accumulated undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries. the company intends to continue to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings, except in instances in which the repatriation would result in minimal additional tax. as a result of the recently enacted u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, we envision that the income tax that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal.

2017 versus 2016
operating cash provided by operating activities was $254.5 million in 2017 compared to $365.6 million in 2016. the decline was due to (i) a decline in net income, which was $3.3 million in the 2017 period compared to $193.6 million in the 2016 period; (ii) unfavorable changes in working capital in 2017 compared to 2016; and (iii) substantially higher cash payments for bonuses, commissions, interest on our borrowings, and acquisition and integration costs in the 2017 period compared to 2016.
investing cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion in 2017 compared to $84.0 million of cash used in 2016. cash used in 2017 was substantially higher primarily due to the acquisitions of ceb and l2 in april 2017 and march 2017, respectively. note 2 - acquisitions and divestiture in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company's acquisitions. we also made additional investment in capital expenditures in 2017, with $110.8 million invested in 2017 compared to $49.9 million in 2016.
financing cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2017 compared to cash used of $174.7 million in 2016. during the 2017 period, the company borrowed a total of approximately $3.0 billion and paid: (i) $404.4 million in principal repayments, including $300.0 million for the senior unsecured 364-day bridge credit facility; (ii) $51.2 million for deferred financing fees on borrowings; and (iii) $41.3 million for share repurchases. during the 2016 period, the company used $59.0 million in cash for share repurchases and $125.0 million for debt.
2016 versus 2015
operating operating cash flow increased by $20.1 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. the 2016 increase was primarily due to higher net income and the adoption of asu no. 2016-09. partially offsetting these increases were higher cash payments for acquisition and integration costs, bonus and commissions, and interest on our borrowings.
investing we used $84.0 million of cash in our investing activities in 2016 compared to $242.4 million of cash used in 2015. cash used in 2015 was substantially higher due to additional expenditures for acquisitions.
financing cash used was $174.7 million in 2016, which consisted of $59.0 million paid for share repurchases and $125.0 million for payments and fees on debt, which was partially offset by $9.3 million in cash realized from employee share-related activities. in the 2015 period the company used $67.7 million in cash in its financing activities, with $509.0 million in cash used for share repurchases, while net borrowings on debt and employee share-related activities provided cash of $441.3 million.

executive overview factset research systems inc. (the "company" or "factset") provides integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. we deliver insight and information to financial investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology. by integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, we support the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. these professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. from streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, factset offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless, and off-platform solutions. our wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. our revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data and content, research management and trade execution. investment management (buy-side) clients account for 84.1% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ("m&a") advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.
2017 year in review fiscal 2017 results continued our positive topline growth. organic revenue was up 6.9% while annual subscription value ("asv") increased 5.7% organically. this fiscal year marked our 39th year of operation, our 37th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 21st consecutive year of adjusted earnings growth as a public company. we have dedicated ourselves to helping our clients navigate an uncertain environment. as of august 31, 2017, asv totaled $1.32 billion, an increase of $166.8 million over the prior year. in addition, clients and users reached new highs of 4,744 and 88,846, respectively, in fiscal 2017. we returned $341.9 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

in fiscal 2017, we continued to diversity our suite of products through strategic acquisitions and product investments, including vermilion holdings limited ("vermilion") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, along with both bi-sam technologies ("bisam") and interactive data managed solutions, renamed factset digital solutions, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. these acquisitions increased factset's footprint in europe, added to the company's robust product offerings, and provided end-to-end solutions to clients.
as a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model factset was awarded "best market data provider" and "best data analytics provider" by inside market data in fiscal 2017. we were also named the "best performance measurement system provider" by waters technology and other recognition included "best research and analytics tool" award for our wealth management tools at the annual systems in the city awards. portware also earned "best buy-side ems" for the fourth time and vermilion was recognized as "best client reporting solution" by ftf news technology innovation and "best client reporting solution" by wealthbriefing european awards.
client service / consultants a client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at factset. we support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. according to our fiscal 2017 global client satisfaction survey, 95% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset's support, consistent with the prior year. the depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.
our industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. as of august 31, 2017, employee headcount was 9,074, up 8.3% from a year ago. excluding workforces acquired in fiscal 2017, headcount increased 2.4% from a year ago. the increases were primarily in client-focused positions focused on client loyalty as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of asv as of august 31, 2017. our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings.
educating our clients is also an important component of our service. not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but factset personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. as a result, clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. during fiscal 2017, over 2,500 clients attended live or online factset training sessions, with over 54,000 elearning courses taken.
in may 2017, john w. wiseman was named the company's new executive vice president, global head of sales and client solutions. in this role, mr. wiseman reports directly to factset's chief executive officer, phil snow, and is responsible for all global sales and client service activities for the company.
in order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in india and the philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 5,000 people. of our total employees, 2,493 were located in the u.s., 1,322 in europe and 5,259 in asia pacific. approximately 70% of the company's employees were involved in company operations including content collection and software and systems engineering, 27% had a client focused role conducting sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support.

(1)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. we use free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives.

(2)   asv grew 5.7% organically year over year. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.

(3)   in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its asv definition to exclude professional services as these fees are not subscription based.

(4)   in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its client count definition to capture clients with asv greater than $10,000 versus the previous metric of clients with asv greater than $24,000. the prior year client count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes.

(5)   in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its user count definition to account for users from workstations previously not captured due to certain product bundling and also users of the streetaccount web product. the prior year user count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes.

annual subscription value growth annual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. with proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency. asv totaled $1.32 billion at august 31, 2017, up 5.7% organically over the prior year. the increase in asv was driven by growth across the majority of our key workflows including analytics, investment banking, and content and technology solutions ("cts"). additionally, we have leveraged relationships with existing clients to increase year over year sales through cross-selling and upselling of our diversified product suite.
buy-side clients accounted for 84.1% of asv while the remainder derived from sell-side firms that perform mergers and acquisitions advisory work, capital markets services and equity research. the buy-side asv experienced a growth rate of 5.9% compared to prior year, down 440 basis points from fiscal 2016. the sell-side asv had a 4.6% growth rate, down 310 basis points from the prior year.
asv from our u.s. operations was $825.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 4.9% organically from a year ago. international asv totaled $491.5 million, up 7.7% organically from a year ago. asv from our international operations represented 37.3% of our company-wide total, its highest level in factset history. our european organic asv achieved a growth rate of 6.1% over the last 12 months while asia pacific organic asv grew by 12.8%. this substantial shift in asv to international operations was due primarily to our recent acquisitions, which have significant sales and operations in europe.
client and user additions in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its client count definition to capture clients with asv greater than $10,000 versus the previous metric of clients with asv greater than $24,000. the prior year client count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes. our total client count was 4,744 as of august 31, 2017 representing an increase of 539 net new clients or an equivalent 12.8% increase over fiscal 2016, as a result of cross-selling within factset's diverse product suite. we continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.
24
in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its user count definition to account for users from workstations previously not captured due to certain product bundling and also users of the streetaccount web product. the prior year user count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes. using the new definition, as of august 31, 2017, there were 88,846 professionals using factset, an increase of 4,910 users or an equivalent 5.8% increase compared to fiscal 2016.
annual client retention as of august 31, 2017, was greater than 95% asv and 91% when expressed as a percentage of clients, down slightly from 92% in the prior year. our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. august 31, 2017, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with august 31, 2016.

revenues fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016

income taxes fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
the fiscal 2017 provision for income taxes was $86.1 million, down 29.6% from the same period a year ago. this decrease was primarily due to tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of our market metrics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. excluding the tax impact of the gain, the provision for income taxes decreased by 5.9% year over year related primarily to our organizational realignment. effective september 1, 2016 we realigned certain aspects of our global operations from factset research systems inc., our u.s. parent company, to factset uk limited, a u.k. operating company, to better position us to serve our growing client base outside the u.s. due to the realignment we recognized a 200 basis point benefit in our annual tax rate. additionally, excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, our provision for income taxes decreased due to a decrease in taxable income year over year. this decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense incurred as a result of an increase in our outstanding debt borrowings by approximately $300 million.

the fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% compared to fiscal 2015. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of our market metrics business. excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in december 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $194.7 million, or 13.8% of our total assets at august 31, 2017, compared with $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at august 31, 2016. our cash and cash equivalents decreased $33.7 million during fiscal 2017 due primarily to $303.1 million in cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired), $252.8 million in share repurchases under the existing share repurchase program, dividend payments of $80.9 million, capital expenditures of $36.9 million and $7.4 million from the purchase of investments (net of proceeds). these cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $320.5 million, $275.0 million in net proceeds from long-term debt, $50.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $10.3 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and $1.3 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuation.
free cash flow for fiscal 2017 was $283.7 million compared to $283.4 million in the prior year comparable period. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2017 was attributable to $258.3 million of net income adjusted for $78.3 million of non-cash items partially offset by $36.9 million in capital expenditures and $16.0 million of negative working capital changes. free cash flow increased slightly from the comparable year ago period, due primarily to a reduction in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of higher client receivables and the timing of taxes payments. our day's sales outstanding ("dso") was 41 days as of august 31, 2017, representing an increase from 31 days at august 31, 2016. the increase in dso was primarily related to our recent acquisitions as we work to align their collection policies with those of factset.
net cash used in investing activities was $347.3 million in fiscal 2017, representing a $188.9 million increase from fiscal 2016 due primarily to an increase in the cash used in acquisitions and the purchases of investments (net of proceeds), partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. additionally, in fiscal 2016 we recognized proceeds from the sale of our market metrics business of $153.1 million. acquisitions during fiscal 2017, largely related to bisam and vermilion, resulted in a cash outflow of $303.1 million compared to a net cash outflow of $262.9 million for the portware acquisition during fiscal 2016. purchase of investments (net of proceeds) results in an increased cash outflow of $6.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in capital expenditures of $10.9 million was due fiscal 2016 including the fit-out of new space in new york, chicago and at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. fiscal 2017 capital expenditures related primarily to computer equipment for our u.s. locations and additional expenses at our chicago, new york, and india locations.
31
during fiscal 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $8.2 million compared to $91.0 million in fiscal 2016. this decrease was due primarily to factset entering into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock in july 2016. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with us receiving an additional 102,916 shares of our common stock. excluding cash used in the asr agreement, cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $29.0 million, resulting in a fluctuation of $37.2 million in the current year. this fluctuation was due to an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock under our existing share repurchase program of $24.2 million, an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $6.7 million, lower proceeds from employee stock plans of $6.8 million and lower tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements of $7.9 million. cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million in fiscal 2016. dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 12.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2017. the year over year fluctuation was also due to additional borrowings under our 2017 credit agreement (defined in capital needs) of $575.0 million, used to fund our acquisition of bisam on march 17, 2017 and retire our existing debt of $365.0 million. in fiscal 2016 we borrowed $265.0 million under our previous credit agreement to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16, 2015. refer to the capital resources section of the md&a for a discussion of our long-term debt borrowings.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. as of august 31, 2017, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $194.7 million, with $575.0 million in outstanding borrowings. approximately $17.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $141.2 million in europe (predominantly within the uk, france, and germany) and the remaining $35.7 million is held in the asia pacific region. as of august 31, 2017, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at august 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at august 31, 2015. our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our market metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. these cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.
free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. free cash flow generated in fiscal 2016 was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.
net cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in new york, chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in norwalk. these cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our market metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.
during fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. the year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. the proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under our previous credit agreement used to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16, 2015. cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the asr agreement entered into in july 2016. we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016.

capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $36.9 million during fiscal 2017, down from $47.7 million a year ago. approximately $21.4 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including $4.4 million at our chicago location, $4.4 million at our new york locations and $2.7 million at our india locations.
capital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million in fiscal 2015. approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our new york location, $3.9 million at our chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.
capital needs long-term debt on march 17, 2017, the company entered into a credit agreement (the "2017 credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and pnc bank, national association ("pnc"), as the administrative agent and lender. the 2017 credit agreement provides for a $575.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2017 revolving credit facility"). we may request borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 17, 2020. the 2017 credit agreement also allows factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to $225.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. at our option, a borrowing may be in the form of a base rate loan or a libor rate loan. borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
in conjunction with factset's entrance into the 2017 credit agreement, the company borrowed $575.0 million in the form of a libor rate loan under the 2017 revolving credit facility and retired the outstanding debt under its previous credit agreement between factset, as the borrower, and bank of america, n.a., as the lender. the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was $365.0 million and there were no prepayment penalties. proceeds from the 2017 revolving credit facility were also used to fund factset's acquisition of bisam.
all outstanding loan amounts are reported as long-term debt within the consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2017. during fiscal 2017 and 2016, we paid approximately $8.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in interest on our outstanding loan amounts. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
as of august 31, 2017, no commitment fee was owed by factset since it borrowed the full amount under the 2017 credit agreement. in fiscal 2017, factset incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal costs to draft and review the 2017 credit agreement. these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.
the 2017 credit agreement contained covenants restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan. in addition, the 2017 credit agreement required that factset maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/ebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the 2017 credit agreement as of august 31, 2017.
as of august 31, 2017, the fair value of our long-term debt was $575.0 million, which we believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.
letters of credit from time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. approximately $1.9 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of august 31, 2017. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.

foreign currency foreign currency exposure certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.
as of august 31, 2017, our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be approximately $90 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are approximately $300 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of approximately $210 million per year. our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where 73% of our employees were located as of august 31, 2017. during fiscal 2017, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $7.1 million, compared to $11.6 million a year ago.
foreign currency hedges as of august 31, 2017, factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019. the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs. 3.8 billion.
there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31, 2017. a loss on derivatives of $2.9 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2017, compared to a loss of $0.5 million in fiscal 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program in fiscal 2017, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $252.8 million compared to 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million in fiscal 2016 under the our existing share repurchase program. over the last 12 months, we have returned $341.9 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, funded by cash generated from operations. on march 27, 2017, the board of directors of factset approved a $300.0 million expansion of to the existing share repurchase program. including this expansion, $244.1 million is available for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2017.
on july 1, 2016, we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with us receiving an additional 102,916 shares of our common stock.
contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.

(1)   operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. for more information on our operating leases, see note 19, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8.

(2)   purchase commitments represent payments due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services.

(3)   represents the amount due under the company's 2017 credit agreement.

(4)   non-current income taxes payable of $11.5 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $24.9 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.
at august 31, 2017, we leased approximately 1,143,000 square feet of office space, which we believe is adequate for our current needs and that additional space is available for lease to meet any future needs. including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2017, our worldwide-leased office space increased by approximately 71,000 square feet, or 7%, from august 31, 2016. this increase was primarily due to leases related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 as well as expanded office space in india, offset by the consolidation of certain other office spaces.
as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this md&a, factset entered into the 2017 credit agreement on march 17, 2017 and borrowed $575.0 million. in conjunction with the 2017 credit agreement, factset retired its outstanding loan amount of $365.0 million under the previous credit agreement.
with the exception of the new leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and the 2017 credit agreement, there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2017.
dividends on may 5, 2017, our board of directors approved a 12.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment on june 2017 which was $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share per annum. with our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $341.9 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.
significant accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
performance-based equity awards we have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
february 2015 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of code red, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. of the total amount granted, 68,761 performance-based options were eligible to vest if certain code red asv and operating margin targets were achieved over a two-year measurement period ending february 28, 2017. at the conclusion of the measurement period, 70% of the options were deemed eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. the option holders must remain employed by factset through february 28, 2019 in order for the options to vest. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.8 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 1.4 years.
36
the remaining 68,761 options granted in february 2015 are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending february 28, 2019. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.4 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 1.4 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative              remaining expense catch-up adjustment*          to be recognized

* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2017.
october 2015 and august 2016 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the vesting of these grants to allow 70% of the options to become eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. in conjunction with this modification, we recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $1.8 million. the remaining options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date provided the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $2.9 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 3.1 years.
we granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 with similar performance conditions. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, factset modified the vesting of these grants to allow 70% of the options to become eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. in conjunction with this modification, factset recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $0.1 million. the remaining options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date provided the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.4 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 3.9 years.
january 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of vermilion, factset granted 61,744 performance-based stock options in january 2017. these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain vermilion revenue and operating income targets are achieved by november 30, 2018. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2017, factset does not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by vermilion in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative          remaining expense catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

0% (current expectation)                -                       -

37
june 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of bisam, factset granted 206,417 performance-based stock options in june 2017. these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets are achieved by march 31, 2019. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2017, factset does not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by bisam in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative          remaining expense catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

0% (current expectation)                         -                     -

* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2017.
accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $39.2 million and $38.2 million, respectively.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. at least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group ("codmg"), composed of the ceo and senior management, manages the business and the demographic markets in which factset serves. the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years. while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, consistent with previous years, it was determined that there was no impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $707.6 million and $452.9 million, respectively.
our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. these useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2017 and 2016.
38
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $173.5 million and $93.2 million, respectively.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $100.5 million and $84.6 million, respectively.
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. our annual effective tax rate was 25.0%, 26.5% and 27.8% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
39
as of august 31, 2017, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million, including $1.5 million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) within the consolidated balance sheet. unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. if recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. for this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
new accounting pronouncements see note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
approximately 84.1% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. our investment banking clients that perform m&a advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 15.9% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. clients could encounter similar problems. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in m&a funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.
due to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. to the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. to manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). by their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.
on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom ("uk") held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union ("eu"), commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies had been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar at that time. volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu. the uk inflation rate has also experienced significant price level increase compared to the past four years. as the negotiation process continues and the timeframe from the initial vote increases, the uk economic performance has been stronger than originally expected. increased european confidence and uk consumer spending has contributed to the recovery of the economic outlook. in the longer term, as negotiations continue, any impact from brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. our products, including our datasets such as georev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world's largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein. founded in 1935 by john w. tyson and grown under three generations of family leadership, the company has a broad portfolio of products and brands like tyson®, jimmy dean®, hillshire farm®, ball park®, wright®, aidells®, ibp® and state fair®. some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.
we operate in four reportable segments: beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods. other primarily includes our foreign chicken production operations in china and india, third-party merger and integration costs and corporate overhead related to tyson new ventures, llc.
on june 7, 2017, we acquired and consolidated advancepierre foods holdings, inc.

overview
•   fiscal year - our accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2015.
•   general - our fiscal 2017 operating income grew 3% compared to fiscal 2016 to a record $2,931 million, which was led by record earnings in our beef and pork segments. the beef segment's operating income improved $530 million and the pork segment improved $117 million in fiscal 2017 due to favorable market conditions and strong operational execution. our chicken segment's lower operating income was impacted by increased operating costs and $56 million of restructuring and related charges. our prepared foods segment's lower operating income was impacted by increased operating costs, impairments of $52 million related to our san diego prepared foods operation and $45 million related to the expected sale of a non-protein business and $82 million of restructuring and related charges. in addition, we incurred an incremental $95 million of compensation and benefit integration expense in fiscal 2017, as we continued to integrate and make investments in our talent, and incurred $85 million of advancepierre purchase accounting and acquisition related operating costs. sales increased 4% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes and increased beef, pork and chicken prices, as well as the net incremental impact of advancepierre's sales of $508 million.
•   market environment - according to the united states department of agriculture (usda), domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) increased approximately 3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the beef segment experienced strong export demand and more favorable domestic market conditions associated with an increase in cattle supply. the pork segment had favorable market conditions associated with strong demand for our pork products and improved export markets. there was stronger demand for our chicken products and reduced feed ingredient costs of $80 million, which benefited the chicken segment. our prepared foods segment had improved demand for our retail products but experienced a decline in foodservice and higher input costs of $50 million.
•   margins - our total operating margin was 7.7% in fiscal 2017. operating margins by segment were as follows:
•   beef - 5.9%
•   pork - 12.3%
•   chicken -9.2% (included $56 million of restructuring and related charges)
•   prepared foods - 5.9% (included $52 million impairment related to our san diego prepared foods operation, $45 million impairment related to the expected sale of a non-protein business, $82 million of restructuring and related charges and $34 million of purchase accounting and acquisition related costs from the acquisition of advancepierre.)
•   hillshire integration - the impact of the the hillshire brands company ("hillshire brands") synergies, along with the profit improvement plan related to our legacy prepared foods business, had a positive incremental impact of approximately $90 million in fiscal 2017 above the $258 million captured in fiscal 2016 and $322 million captured in fiscal 2015, for a total of $670 million of synergies realized. the majority of these benefits were realized in the prepared foods segment and were partially used to invest in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our brands.
•   liquidity - during fiscal 2017, we generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flows. at september 30, 2017, we had $1.0 billion of liquidity, which included $318 million of cash and cash equivalents and the availability under our revolving credit facility after deducting amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.

•   strategy - in fiscal 2017, we announced our strategy to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing portfolio of protein-packed brands. we intend to accomplish this by growing our portfolio of protein-packed brands and delivering food at scale, which will be enabled by driving profitable growth with and for our customers through differentiated capabilities and creating fuel for reinvestment through a disciplined financial fitness model.
•   on june 7, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of advancepierre as part of our overall strategy. the purchase price was equal to $40.25 per share in cash for advancepierre's outstanding common stock, or approximately $3.2 billion. we funded the acquisition with existing cash on hand, net proceeds from the issuance of new senior notes, as well as borrowings under our commercial paper program and new term loan facility. advancepierre's results from operations subsequent to the acquisition closing are included in the prepared foods and chicken segments. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 3: acquisition and dispositions.
•   on april 24, 2017, we announced our intent to sell three non-protein businesses, sara lee® frozen bakery, kettle and van's®, which are all included in our prepared foods segment, as part of our strategic focus on protein-packed brands. we have reclassified the assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of september 30, 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $45 million related to one of these businesses due to a revised estimate of the business' fair value based on current expected net sales proceeds. the impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2017, and consisted of goodwill and intangible assets previously classified within assets held for sale. we anticipate we will close the transactions by the end of calendar 2017, or early calendar 2018, and expect to record a net pretax gain as a result of the sale of these businesses. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 3: acquisition and dispositions.
•   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, our board of directors approved a multi-year restructuring program (the "financial fitness program"), which is expected to contribute to the company's overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction. through a combination of synergies from the integration of advancepierre and additional elimination of non-valued added costs, the financial fitness program is estimated to result in cumulative net savings of $200 million in fiscal 2018, $400 million in fiscal 2019 including new savings of $200 million, and $600 million in fiscal 2020 including additional savings of $200 million. approximately 50-60% of these net savings, which are focused on supply chain, procurement, and overhead improvements, are expected to be realized in the prepared foods segment with the majority of the remaining net savings impacting the chicken segment. additionally, we estimate that approximately 75% of the net savings will be reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income, with the remaining in selling, general and administrative.
as part of the financial fitness program, we anticipate eliminating approximately 500 positions across several areas and job levels with most of the eliminated positions originating from the corporate offices in springdale, arkansas; chicago, illinois; and cincinnati, ohio. as a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized restructuring and related charges of $150 million that consisted of $53 million severance and employee related costs, $72 million technology impairment and related costs, and $25 million for contract termination costs. the company currently anticipates the financial fitness program will result in cumulative pretax charges, once implemented, of approximately $215 million which consist primarily of severance and employee related costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, incremental costs to implement new technology, and contract termination costs. the following tables set forth the pretax impact of restructuring and related charges incurred in fiscal 2017 in the consolidated statements of income and the pretax impact by our reportable segments. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 6: restructuring and related charges.

•   liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and availability under our revolving credit facility, less outstanding commercial paper balance.
•   at september 30, 2017, we had current debt of $906 million, which we intend to repay with cash generated from our operating activities and other liquidity sources.
•   the revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit and also serves to backstop our commercial paper program. the letters of credit issued under this facility are primarily in support of leasing obligations and workers' compensation insurance programs. our maximum borrowing under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2017 was $590 million.
•   we expect net interest expense will approximate $325 million for fiscal 2018.
•   at september 30, 2017, approximately $308 million of our cash was held in the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. rather, we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. united states income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. our intention is to reinvest the cash held by foreign subsidiaries permanently or to repatriate the cash only when it is tax efficient to do so.
•   our ratio of short-term assets to short-term liabilities ("current ratio") was 1.55 to 1 and 1.77 to 1 at september 30, 2017, and october 1, 2016, respectively.

capital resources credit facility cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. we also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.5 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and to backstop our commercial paper program. as of september 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings and $8 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $1,492 million available for borrowing. our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 41 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $106 million per bank. the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.
commercial paper program our commercial paper program provides a low-cost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is $800 million. the maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. as of september 30, 2017, $778 million was outstanding under this program with maturities less than 45 days.
capitalization to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our long-term financing decisions. at september 30, 2017, and october 1, 2016, the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 2.7x and 1.7x, respectively. refer to part ii, item 6, selected financial data, for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures. the increase in this ratio for fiscal 2017 is primarily a result of the incremental debt from the advancepierre acquisition.

debt covenants our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt-to-capitalization ratios.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2017.
pension plans as further described in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pensions and other postretirement benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $195 million at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to an underfunded position of $336 million at the end of fiscal 2016.
we expect to contribute approximately $38 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 as compared to approximately $53 million in fiscal 2017 and $64 million in fiscal 2016. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. as a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2018 may be different from the estimate.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. the off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including leases and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. see part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 20: commitments and contingencies for further discussion.

(1)   in the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.
(2)   interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at september 30, 2017, and expected payment dates.
(3)   amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of leases and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. the amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.
(4)   amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.
(5)   amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. for certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of september 30, 2017. we have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancelable. contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.
(6)   amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of september 30, 2017.
(7)   other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance, and asset retirement obligations. we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2018; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. we also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $258 million that are excluded from the table above. a discussion of the company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pensions and other postretirement benefits.
in addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $296 million and related interest and penalties of $63 million at september 30, 2017, recorded as liabilities.
the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 30, 2017, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier's net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $380 million. there were no receivables under these programs at september 30, 2017.
recently issued/adopted accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion under part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1: business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2: changes in accounting principles.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical.

marketing, advertising and promotion costs we promote our products with marketing, advertising, trade promotions, and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance, utilization and redemption rates of each program.                                                                                                                                                                                                        we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals during the past three fiscal years.
marketing, advertising, and promotion costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. we accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption rates of each program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       these estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. the remainder of marketing, advertising and promotion costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            a 10% change in our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals at september 30, 2017, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $15 million.

we use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods.   the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods.
net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was $28 million in fiscal 2017. the projected benefit obligation was $1,707 million at the end of fiscal 2017. unrecognized actuarial gain was $44 million at the end of fiscal 2017. we currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2018 to be approximately $15 million, excluding the pending settlement as described in note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits.                                             the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. in determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. we then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality.   a 1% increase in the discount rate at september 30, 2017, would result in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $187 million and $19 million, respectively. a 1% decrease in the discount rate at september 30, 2017, would result in an increase in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $229 million and $14 million, respectively.
plan assets are currently comprised of approximately 87% fixed income securities and 9% equity securities. fixed income securities can include, but are not limited to, direct bond investments and pooled or indirect bond investments. other investments may include, but are not limited to, international and domestic equities, real estate, commodities and private equity.                                                                                                                     it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a 1% change in the return on plan assets at september 30, 2017, would impact the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $15 million.
we expect to contribute approximately $38 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2018. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                the risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. the net pension cost of the multi-employer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our employees. the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations.                                                                                                                                                                the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and that the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.

federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be taxable upon remittance to the united states, except for earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary.   changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future.                                                                                                              to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.              our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate.
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset.                                                                                                                           our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.
we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance. when evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated undiscounted future cash flows. an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. for assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. we recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets and definite life intangibles of $214 million, $45 million and $262 million, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.                          our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.   we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.
we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies. if we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets description: goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. if it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test.
in january 2017, the fasb issued updated guidance simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment. the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. we early adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017; however, the adoption did not have an impact to our fiscal 2017 goodwill impairment assessment. for further description of this new guidance, refer to part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2: changes in accounting principles.
for indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2017 impairment test.
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. however, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.
judgments and uncertainties: we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of various valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) and market approaches (ebitda multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies and precedent transactions). our primary technique is discounted cash flow analysis. these approaches use significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy and requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.
we include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries.
our prepared foods reporting unit, which is our prepared foods operating segment, had goodwill at september 30, 2017, totaling $3,678 million. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 10% to 12%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. the current year prepared foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2017 including $213 million of charges related to an acquisition, impairment of our san diego operation, impairment associated with the expected sale of a non-protein business, and restructuring and related charges. additionally, we are in the process of divesting three non-protein businesses and integrating advancepierre's prepared operations into the prepared foods reporting unit, as well as executing our financial fitness program which should collectively improve operating results in future periods. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2017, the prepared foods reporting unit's projected operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, had to average 6.6% (breakeven). we exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, as well as each of the previous two fiscal years, and expect to well exceed it in fiscal 2018 and in future years.
the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions: we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years.

during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the goodwill impairment analysis. in fiscal 2015, we recorded a $23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit's goodwill.
some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market ebitda comparables and credit ratings. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.
all of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of impairment.
the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 6.7% in fiscal 2017 from 6.2% in fiscal 2016. discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels. a 54% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of our prepared foods reporting unit, with $3,678 million of goodwill at september 30, 2017, to exceed its discounted cash flows' fair value.
our fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. all indefinite life intangible assets' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment.
the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 7.9% in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. a 20% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of one intangible asset, which has a carrying value of $533 million, to exceed fair value.

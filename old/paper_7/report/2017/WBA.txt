introduction on march 31, 2017, walgreens boots alliance and pharmacy benefit manager prime therapeutics llc closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, as part of a strategic alliance. alliancerx walgreens prime is consolidated by walgreens boots alliance and reported within the retail pharmacy usa division in its financial statements. see note 6, acquisitions for further information.
on december 31, 2014, walgreens boots alliance became the successor of walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure, with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company. pursuant to the reorganization, walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into walgreens boots alliance common stock. also on december 31, 2014, following the completion of the reorganization, walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of alliance boots gmbh ("alliance boots") that walgreens did not previously own (the "second step transaction") in exchange for Â£3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock. alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the second step transaction. for financial reporting and accounting purposes, walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots. the consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31, 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014.
in addition, we have undertaken a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. please refer to note 3, exit and disposal activities, note 5, equity method investments and note 6, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 below for additional information.
terminated acquisition of rite aid corporation ("rite aid") and related matters on october 27, 2015, walgreens boots alliance entered into an agreement and plan of merger with rite aid and victoria merger sub, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance (as amended as described below, the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire rite aid, a drugstore chain in the united states. the merger agreement was amended by amendment no. 1 thereto on january 29, 2017.
in connection with regulatory review of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement, on december 20, 2016, walgreens boots alliance and rite aid announced that they had entered into an agreement (the "fred's asset purchase agreement"), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to sell certain rite aid stores and certain assets related to store operations to fred's, inc. ("fred's") for $950 million in an all-cash transaction. the transaction was subject to the approval and completion of the acquisition of rite aid by walgreens boots alliance pursuant to the merger agreement.
on june 28, 2017, walgreens boots alliance and rite aid entered into a mutual termination agreement (the "termination agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the merger agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, or entered pursuant thereto (other than as expressly specified) (collectively with the merger agreement, the "transaction documents"), effective as of june 28, 2017. pursuant to the termination agreement, the company paid rite aid the termination fee of $325 million, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the company under the merger agreement and other transaction documents. the parties also agreed to release each other from, among other things, any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the transaction documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters.

see note 8, borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the termination of the merger agreement and related matters.
acquisition of certain rite aid assets on june 28, 2017, the company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "asset purchase agreement") with rite aid, pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid.
on september 19, 2017, the company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement (the "amended and restated asset purchase agreement") to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. as of the date of this report, the first few rite aid stores have been acquired. ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. these transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.
the company expects to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years, at an estimated cost of approximately $750 million, which will be reported as acquisition-related costs. in addition, the company plans to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. the company intends to treat charges related to acquisition integration activities as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the company expects to realize annual synergies from the transaction of more than $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
exit and disposal activities store optimization program on october 24, 2017, the company's board of directors approved a plan to implement a program (the "store optimization program") as part of an initiative to optimize store locations within the company's retail pharmacy usa division upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from rite aid. the store optimization program includes plans to close approximately 600 stores across the u.s. and is expected to result in cost savings of $300 million per year to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. the actions under the store optimization program are expected to take place over an 18 month period beginning in spring 2018.
the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. the company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. the company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in future cash expenditures.
as the store optimization program is implemented, charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with gaap. the company intends to treat charges related to the store optimization program as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
cost transformation program on april 8, 2015, the walgreens boots alliance board of directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the "cost transformation program") as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. the cost
- 34 -
transformation program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. in april 2015, the company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the u.s.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. the actions under the cost transformation program focused primarily on our retail pharmacy usa segment. the company achieved $1.5 billion in savings from its previously announced cost transformation program ahead of schedule. as announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expected to close a total of approximately 260 stores.
the company completed the cost transformation program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. the company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with gaap of $1.8 billion. these charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. the company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. see note 3, exit and disposal activities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
comparability as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. prior to december 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs, along with the fully consolidated results of walgreens boots alliance development gmbh ("wbad"), a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots, and equity earnings from alliance boots. following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, we report results in three segments. segmental reporting includes the allocation of procurement benefits, including wbad's results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31, 2014. we have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. accordingly, our retail pharmacy usa segment results for fiscal 2015 for months prior to december 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of walgreens, the full consolidated results of wbad and equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots.
the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month periods ended august 31, 2017 and 2016 include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended august 31, 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots for four months (september through december 2014).
twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.
in addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.
amerisourcebergen corporation relationship in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through wbad. in may 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.
in addition, in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and gain

associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. please refer to our form 8-k filed on march 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. as of august 31, 2017, we owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors. as of august 31, 2017, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. the amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.
effective march 18, 2016, we began accounting for our investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our pharmaceutical wholesale segment. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. due to the march 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended august 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in amerisourcebergen. similarly, our results for the 12 month period ended august 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on august 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.
recent hurricanes the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2018 gaap financial results of approximately $90 million for the cost of storm damages and store closures. the majority of these charges will be incurred in puerto rico. the company intends to treat these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.

walgreens boots alliance results of operations fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect rite aid related costs, the phasing of the company's cost transformation program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate.
other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. in fiscal 2016 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, we recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the rite aid transaction.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between our financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. our mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by our cost transformation program and costs associated with the termination of the rite aid merger agreement, both of which reduced our u.s. pre-tax earnings. for fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the u.k. tax rate, adopting asu 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years.
adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from amerisourcebergen and a lower effective tax rate. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 1.1 percent to $4.2 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 4.5 percent to $3.82 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in alliance boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa.
other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants, excluding deferred income amortization, resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during june 2016. fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors. first, our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to fiscal 2015, when the company had only eight months of those earnings after the second step transaction. further, in fiscal 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the amerisourcebergen warrants then held by the company. in addition, during fiscal 2016 the company benefited from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the united kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit. the company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  these items were partly offset by the facts that in fiscal 2015 the company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in alliance boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in fiscal 2016.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion (including $1.8 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) as of august 31, 2017, compared to $9.8 billion (including $1.6 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) at august 31, 2016. short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. to attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. investments are principally in u.s. treasury money market funds and aaa-rated money market funds.
our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in our core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements, and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.
cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. net cash provided by operating activities was $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015. the $596 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable, net partially offset by higher cash inflows from changes in inventories. decreases in cash inflows on accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted primarily from the timing and payment of expense related accruals. decreases in cash inflows on accounts receivable, net are primarily due to the timing of collections in retail pharmacy usa. increases in cash inflows on inventories resulted primarily from retail pharmacy usa inventory management initiatives related to simplified retail product offering, promotional efficiencies and lower brand name drug inflation.
net cash used for investing activities was $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 and $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015. business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 were $88 million compared to $126 million for the year-ago period. business acquisitions in the current year primarily relate to the purchase of prescription files. business acquisitions in the comparable prior year period include the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files. fiscal 2016 also included an investment in amerisourcebergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants.
additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2017 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015. capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows:

1   our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments were acquired as part of the second step transaction in which we acquired the 55% of alliance boots that we did not already own on december 31, 2014. as a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months of capital expenditures (january through august 2015) were reported for these divisions in fiscal 2015.
significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects.
- 47 -
additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2017 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $444 million, compared to $60 million in the comparable prior year period.
net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $12.9 billion compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016. net cash used for financing activities was $0.9 billion in fiscal 2015. we repurchased shares as part of the $1 billion and $5 billion stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $457 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016 and $500 million in fiscal 2015. proceeds related to employee stock plans were $217 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $235 million in fiscal 2016 and $503 million in fiscal 2015. cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. in fiscal 2017, there were no public debt offerings compared to $6 billion proceeds received from u.s. dollar denominated debt in fiscal 2016 (described below). we currently intend to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, acquisitions (including the acquisition of rite aid assets), dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements.
see item 7a (qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

amerisourcebergen relationship pursuant to our arrangements with amerisourcebergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time as described under "--amerisourcebergen corporation relationship" above. as of august 31, 2017, the company owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock. this includes a total of approximately 11.5 million shares of amerisourcebergen that we purchased in the open market. subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. the transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 11, commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. we use the following methods to determine our estimates:
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of the company's equity and debt securities. this comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
our reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to more than 400%. due to the negative impact of reductions in pharmacy funding in the united kingdom, the fair value of our boots reporting unit, within our retail pharmacy international division, was impacted and is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9%. the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the u.k. industry trends and the impact it may have on the business. see note 7, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments  - we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.
we evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. in determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $389 million to our pension benefit

obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $22 million.
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.
income taxes - we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

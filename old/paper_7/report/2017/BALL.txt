item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k (annual report), which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. the preparation of our  consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. we apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as "ball corporation," "ball," "the company," "we" or "our" in the following discussion and analysis.     overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the world's leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. in the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
we sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. while we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry having seen recent declines in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors.
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. we also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. the pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.
we recognize sales under long-term contracts in our aerospace segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

corporate strategy our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. since launching drive for 10 in 2011, we have made progress on each of the levers as follows:
·   maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and europe, and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple beverage and food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain efficiencies; and in the aerosol business, installing new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our european and indian facilities while also implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;

·   expanding further into new products and capabilities through our acquisition of sonoco's metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in canton, ohio, in february 2015; successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes proprietary technology to significantly lightweight the can; and successfully commercializing the next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology;

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet continued growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which represent approximately 37 percent of our global beverage packaging mix; aligning with craft brewers, sparkling water fillers, wine producers and other new beverage producers who continue to use beverage containers to grow their business;

·   broadening our geographic reach with our acquisition of rexam and our new investments in a beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india and the construction of new beverage can and end facilities in monterrey, mexico, and in our central american joint venture; and

·   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new two-piece, lightweight steel aerosol can, g3 and the increased production of lightweight real® containers, which utilize technology that increases the strength of aluminum used in the manufacturing process while lightweighting the can by 15 percent over a standard aluminum aerosol can and investment in cyber and data analytics to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio.

these ongoing business developments and the successful acquisition of rexam completed on june 30, 2016, help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.
results of operations management's discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact. other factors that did not have a material impact, but that are significant to understand the results, are qualitatively described.     consolidated sales and earnings years ended december 31,

sales in 2017 were $1.9 billion higher compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes for our north and central america, south america and europe segments, increased pass through of higher metal prices for our north and central america and south america segments, favorable currency exchange effects for our europe segment,
23
favorable product mix for our south america segment and increased sales in our aerospace segment. sales volumes for the year ended december 31, 2017 for our north and central america, south america and europe segments were higher compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of 2017 including twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business, while 2016 included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business and six months of sales volumes from the company's legacy business, a significant portion of which was sold with the divestment business. the south america segment experienced organic sales growth, and increased sales from significant u.s. national defense contracts drove revenue growth in the aerospace segment.
net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2017 were $111 million higher than 2016 primarily due to increased earnings related to higher sales volumes in the south america, europe and north and central america beverage can segments, synergy realizations, lower cost of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 which included $84 million for the step-up of inventory related to the acquired rexam business, lower debt refinancing and other costs in 2017 and a decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017, partially offset by higher incremental depreciation. these impacts on net earnings were partially offset by higher tax expense in 2017, due principally to provisional charges from the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22, 2017, income tax benefits in 2016 associated with the restructure of brazil legal entities as a result of the sale of the divestment business, the tax benefit on transaction costs and derivative costs of the rexam acquisition and sale of the divestment business in 2016.
debt refinancing and other costs in 2017 were lower compared to 2016, which included costs on debt associated with the rexam acquisition. see note 13 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs.
the increase in net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to sales of $1.5 billion related to the acquired rexam business, net of ball's legacy sales included in the divestment business. this increase was partially offset by lower metal input costs passed through to customers of $299 million. net earnings were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher business consolidation and other activities from increased costs associated with the rexam acquisition and the sale of the divestment business, increased depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired rexam business, recognition in cost of sales of $84 million step-up of inventory related to the acquired rexam business, higher interest expense associated with the net increase in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of rexam and increased selling, general and administrative costs also due to costs from the acquired rexam business. these decreases were partially offset by a gain of $344 million in 2016 recognized on the sale of the ball legacy portion of the divestment business, lower income tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the tax impacts of the sale of the divestment business, earnings from the increase in net sales from the acquired rexam business, net of the sale of ball's legacy portion of the divestment business, lower net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher equity in results of affiliates.
the decreased debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 compared to 2015 included mark-to-market losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes for debt issuances related to the rexam acquisition, interest expense on issued 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the rexam acquisition, the write off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, and the revolving credit facility and amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement. see note 13 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)
cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $8,717 million in 2017 compared to $7,296 million in 2016 and $6,460 million in 2015. these amounts represented 79 percent, 81 percent and 81 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. cost of sales in 2016 included expense of $84 million for the step-up of inventory related to the acquired rexam business.     depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $729 million in 2017 compared to $453 million in 2016 and $286 million in 2015. these amounts represented 7 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent of consolidated net sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets following the rexam acquisition. during 2017, the company finalized the valuation of
24
the assets acquired in the rexam acquisition. as a result, depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 included a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $35 million related to the last six months of 2016. depreciation expense was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the acquired rexam fixed assets. amortization expense in 2017 and 2016 included $162 million and $65 million, respectively, for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $514 million in 2017 compared to $512 million in 2016 and $450 million in 2015. these amounts represented 5 percent, 6 percent and 6 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. the lower percentage of sg&a expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to office closures and various other cost-out initiatives implemented by the company in relation to the acquired rexam business. the increase in sg&a expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional sg&a from the acquired rexam business and foreign exchange losses of $27 million for the devaluation of the egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016.       business consolidation costs and other activities business consolidation and other activities were $221 million in 2017 compared to $337 million in 2016 and $195 million in 2015. these amounts represented 2 percent, 4 percent and 2 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years, respectively.
the year-over-year decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of $322 million in rexam transaction related costs and $83 million of rexam acquisition related compensation arrangements and a decrease of $173 million in foreign currency exchange losses associated with the rexam transaction. these impacts were partially offset by a decrease of $289 million in the gain recognized in connection with the sale of the ball portion of the divestment business, an increase of $99 million related to completed and pending plant closures, an increase of $44 million related to the settlement of certain ball u.s. defined benefit pension plans and an increase of $34 million for indemnification of certain tax matters provided to the buyer in the sale of the divestment business. see note 5 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities.
the year-over-year increase in business consolidation and other activities for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $202 million for transaction related costs, foreign currency exchange losses of $159 million on foreign currency-denominated restricted cash and debt and $108 million in expense for compensation arrangements, all associated with the rexam acquisition and the sale of the divestment business. the increase was partially offset by a gain of $344 million in connection with the sale of the divestment business. the valuations of currency exchange and interest rates were a primary driver for the amounts recorded in business consolidation and other activities in 2016. see notes 4 and 5 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the rexam transaction and business consolidation and other activities.
interest expense total interest expense was $288 million in 2017 compared to $338 million in 2016 and $260 million in 2015. excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2017 was higher than in 2016 as the average level of debt held during the year was higher following the rexam acquisition. excluding debt refinancing and other costs, interest expense in 2016 was higher compared to 2015 as the company incurred additional debt to pay a portion of the cash consideration due to rexam's shareholders for the rexam acquisition. interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
debt refinancing and other costs were $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to $109 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the amount for the year ended 2016 consisted mainly of (1) interest expense of $49 million through june 30, 2016, on the 3.5 percent and 4.375 percent senior notes issued in december 2015, (2) fair value changes of $20 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with debt issuances, (3) interest expense of $30 million through june 30, 2016, on term a u.s. dollar and term a euro dollar loans associated with the company's credit facility, and (4) amortization of deferred financing fees of $7 million for the
25
bridge facility. see notes 13 and 19 in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.
debt refinancing and other costs were $117 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. these costs consisted of (1) interest expense of $5 million on senior notes issued in december 2015 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the rexam acquisition, (2) fair value changes of $16 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the acquisition of rexam, (3) write offs of unamortized deferred financing fees and other charges of  $16 million for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement, the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility, and refinance of the senior credit facility, (4) the amortization of deferred financing fees of $23 million on the bridge facility, and (5) write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and premiums of $57 million for the redemption of previously issued senior notes and the refinance of senior credit facilities. see notes 13 and 19 in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs.
tax provision the effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the u.s. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
the 2017 effective income tax rate was 32.1 percent compared to negative 100.8 percent for 2016. the effective rate was increased by 16.1 percent for u.s. tax reform, including the impact of the transition tax and remeasurement of the company's net deferred tax asset in the u.s., and by 3.5 percent for discrete tax costs associated with certain business dispositions. the effective rate was reduced by 7.2 percent for the impact of the foreign tax rate differential, net of valuation allowance impact, and tax holidays versus the u.s. tax rate and by 5.4 percent for the impact of current year changes in various foreign tax laws including the u.k. the 2017 effective rate was also reduced by 3.1 percent for the discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption in the first quarter of 2017 of amendments to existing accounting guidance for stock-based compensation, by 1.8 percent for the impact of the u.s. r&d credit, and by 1.6 percent for the impact of the u.s. domestic manufacturing deduction and of the foregoing, the impact of u.s. tax reform, discrete tax costs associated with certain business dispositions, the impact of current year changes to certain foreign tax laws and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction are primarily related to discrete transactions or changes in tax law that are not expected to recur in future periods.
the 2016 full year effective income tax rate was negative 100.8 percent compared to 13.6 percent for 2015. the lower tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 116.0 percentage point reduction for the tax benefit recorded with respect to tax deductible goodwill in a legal entity restructuring in brazil that was completed in 2016. the tax rate was also reduced by 56.8 percentage points for increased benefits from foreign tax rate differences, primarily due to acquisitions, and by 49.6 percentage points for permanent tax differences on significant 2016 business dispositions. these amounts were partially offset by a 41.6 percentage point increase for non-deductible transaction costs related to 2016 acquisitions and a 36.8 percentage point increase for increases in valuation allowances, primarily on losses in the u.k. in 2016, we incurred a significant amount of nonrecurring business consolidation costs primarily in the u.s. the resulting reduction in earnings before income tax as a result of these costs increased the impact of permanent income tax items on the company's effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the act) was signed into law. the act significantly changed u.s. income tax law by, among other things, reducing the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, transitioning from a global tax system to a modified territorial tax system, eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction, providing for immediate expensing of certain qualified capital expenditures and limiting the tax deductions for interest expense and executive compensation. in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded tax expense of $83 million for the estimated impact of the mandatory deemed repatriation of its foreign earnings and revaluation of its u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities. the company's review of the implications of the act will be ongoing throughout 2018, and as such, adjustments to any provisional estimates of the act's impact may be required. these provisional estimates are as follows:
·   reduction of u.s. federal corporate tax rate: the company has recorded a provisional increase to tax expense of $52 million for the estimated impact of revaluing its net deferred tax asset position in the u.s. at the new

26
21 percent corporate tax rate. while this is a reasonable estimate, it may be impacted by other analyses related to the act, including the calculation of the transition tax;

·   transition tax: the company has recorded a provisional increase to tax expense of $31 million to reflect the impact of the tax on accumulated untaxed earnings and profits (e&amp;p) of certain foreign affiliates. to determine the amount of the transition tax, the amount of the post-1986 e&amp;p and the amount of non-u.s. income taxes paid on such earnings must be calculated for all relevant foreign affiliates. while this estimated impact is reasonable, additional information will be gathered and analyzed in order to more precisely calculate the final impact of the transition tax;

·   valuation allowances: the company must assess the impact of the various aspects of the act on its valuation allowance analyses, including the transition tax. as the company has recorded provisional estimates with respect to certain aspects of the act, any corresponding impacts from changes in valuation allowances are also provisional estimates; and

·   cost recovery: the company has made a provisional estimate of the impact on its current tax expense and deferred tax liabilities associated with the new immediate expensing provisions for certain qualifying expenditures made after september 27, 2017. the estimate will be refined as the necessary computations are completed with respect to the full inventory of all qualifying 2017 expenditures.

due to the complexity of the new provisions for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) and the base erosion anti-abuse tax (beat), the company is continuing to evaluate the accounting implications of these provisions of the act. the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due for gilti or beat as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into the company's measurement of its deferred taxes. the calculation of the impact and selection of an accounting policy will depend on a detailed analysis of the company's global income and other tax attributes to determine the potential impact, if any, of these provisions. the company is not currently able to determine a reasonable estimate for these items. as a result, no estimate has been recorded and no policy decision has yet been made regarding whether to factor the impact of gilti or beat into the company's measurement of its deferred taxes.
in future periods, while we cannot estimate the impact on our effective tax rate, the company expects the act to favorably impact net earnings, diluted earnings per share and cash flows, primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate effective as of january 1, 2018. we do not expect the act to have a material impact on our state income tax.

the beverage packaging, north and central america, segment consists of operations located in the u.s., canada and mexico that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging. in august 2017, the company announced that the birmingham, alabama, chatsworth, california, and longview, texas, beverage packaging plants will cease production in 2018. in order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans in the southwestern u.s., the company is constructing a beverage packaging facility in goodyear, arizona, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018. our beverage can manufacturing facility in reidsville, north carolina, ceased production at the end of june 2017 and our beverage end manufacturing facility in bristol, virginia, ceased production at the end of june 2016. during the first quarter of 2016, our beverage manufacturing facility in monterrey, mexico, began production.
segment sales in 2017 were $566 million higher compared to 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to $350 million of higher volumes, primarily attributed to the rexam acquisition, and $176 million from the pass through of higher metal prices. sales in 2017 included twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business compared to 2016 which included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business.
comparable operating earnings in 2017 were $64 million higher compared to 2016 primarily due to higher sales volume, largely attributed to the rexam acquisition, favorable product mix, cost savings from the closure of the reidsville plant and other synergy-related activities, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased depreciation. earnings in 2017 included twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business compared to 2016 which included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business.
segment sales in 2016 were $410 million higher compared to 2015. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of $526 million from the acquired rexam business partially offset by lower metal input prices of $176 million.
comparable operating earnings in 2016 were $67 million higher compared to 2015 primarily due to the earnings from the acquired rexam business. improved product mix from the legacy ball business also contributed to the favorable year-over-year operating earnings improvement.

the beverage packaging, south america, segment consists of operations located in brazil, argentina and chile that manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging in most countries in south america. to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across paraguay, argentina and bolivia, the company plans to construct a one-line beverage can and end manufacturing plant in paraguay, and to add capacity to our buenos aires, argentina, facility. the paraguay plant is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2019.
segment sales and comparable operating earnings in 2017 included twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business compared to 2016 which included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business and six months of sales volumes from the company's legacy business, the significant portion of which was sold with the divestment business.
segment sales in 2017 were $678 million higher compared to 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to $545 million in higher volumes, largely attributed to the rexam acquisition, to organic growth and to additional revenue from the end sales agreement with the divestment business that will transition to the divested business in the first half of 2018.  the higher sales also included $158 million from the pass through of higher metal prices.
comparable operating earnings in 2017 were $148 million higher compared to 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes, largely attributed to the rexam acquisition, the end sales agreement with the divestment business, and favorable product mix.
segment sales in 2016 were $423 million higher compared to 2015 and comparable operating earnings in 2016 were $105 million higher compared to 2015. the second half of 2016 included earnings from the rexam business while the second half of 2015 included the company's smaller legacy brazil business.

the beverage packaging europe segment includes the manufacture and sale of metal beverage containers in facilities located throughout europe, including russia. to support growth for beverage cans in the iberian peninsula, the company is constructing a two-line, aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near madrid, spain, with a majority of the facility's capacity secured under a long-term customer contract. the facility is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2018 and will produce multiple can sizes. in the third quarter of 2017, our beverage packaging container and end production facilities in recklinghausen, germany, ceased production.
segment sales and comparable operating earnings in 2017 included twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business compared to 2016 which included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business and six months of sales volumes from the company's legacy european business, the significant portion of which was sold with the divestment business.
segment sales in 2017 were $445 million higher compared to 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to $388 million from increased sales volumes, largely attributed to the rexam acquisition, and favorable currency exchange effects.
comparable operating earnings in 2017 were $16 million higher compared to 2016 primarily due to increased sales volumes largely attributed to the rexam acquisition, cost savings from the closure of the recklinghausen, germany, plant and other synergy-related and production efficiency activities, partially offset by increased incremental depreciation related to the finalization of the fixed asset valuations and useful lives for the rexam acquisition.
segment sales in 2016 were $262 million higher compared to 2015 and comparable operating earnings in 2016 were $25 million higher compared to 2015, both attributed to the rexam acquisition.

the food and aerosol packaging segment consists of operations located in the u.s., europe, canada, mexico, argentina and india that manufacture and sell steel food and aerosol containers, extruded aluminum aerosol containers and slugs. in march 2017, we sold our paint and general line can facility in hubbard, ohio, and in october 2016, we sold our specialty tin manufacturing facility in baltimore, maryland. during the first quarter of 2016, we announced the closure of our food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and end-making facility in weirton, west virginia, which ceased production in the first quarter of 2017.
segment sales in 2017 were $33 million lower compared to 2016. the decrease in 2017 was primarily due to lower food can sales volumes and the sale of the company's baltimore, maryland, and hubbard, ohio, plants.
comparable operating earnings in 2017 were $7 million lower compared to 2016 primarily due to further food can volume and price/cost compression, one-time startup costs for our new flat sheet operations in canton, ohio, during 2017, and the sale of the company's baltimore and hubbard plants, which were partially offset by favorable aerosol product mix and various cost-out initiatives.
segment sales in 2016 were $126 million lower compared to 2015 as a result of $57 million in lower prices resulting from lower metal costs passed through to customers and $69 million in volume primarily driven by lower food can sales volumes. comparable operating earnings in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 due to improved extruded aluminum sales which offset the decline in food can sales volumes.

the aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
segment sales in 2017 were $173 million higher compared to 2016, and comparable operating earnings were $10 million higher. the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2017 was primarily the result of increases from significant u.s. national defense contracts.

segment sales in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015. comparable operating earnings in 2016 increased $6 million compared to 2015 due to individually immaterial items.
sales to the u.s. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2017 compared to 97 percent of segment sales in 2016 and 96 percent in 2015. the aerospace contract mix in 2017 consisted of 63 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 32 percent fixed-price contracts. the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.
contracted backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31, 2017 and 2016, was $1.75 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. the year-over-year increase reflects several major contract awards during 2017. the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. the backlog at december 31, 2017, consisted of 78 percent cost-type contracts. comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.
additional segment information for additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time. if actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.     management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings (earnings before interest, taxes and business consolidation and other non-comparable costs); comparable net earnings (earnings before business consolidation costs and other non-comparable costs after tax); return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (eva®) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (ebit); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda); and diluted earnings per share. management also uses free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) as a measure to evaluate the company's liquidity. we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
the following financial measurements are on a non-u.s. gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. non-u.s. gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. a presentation of earnings in accordance with u.s. gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. the following table summarizes our cash flows:
years ended december 31,
($ in millions)                                         2017                2016                2015
cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities              $1,478                $194                $1,007
cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities               (545)                 672               (2,721)
cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities             (1,073)               (387)                 1,737
cash flows from operations in 2017 were higher compared to 2016 primarily due to improved earnings and working capital. working capital changes in 2017 included a decrease in inventory days on hand from 68 to 61 days, a decrease in days receivables outstanding from 46 to 45 days and an increase in days payable outstanding from 97 to 110 days. the continuing increase in days payable outstanding is a result of longer negotiated contractual terms with suppliers.
cash flows from operations in 2016 were lower compared to 2015 due to increased operating cash outflows in 2016 due to payments of professional fees and employee costs related to the acquisition of rexam and sale of the divestment business of approximately $325 million; $297 million of additional pension funding, including $171 million related to the acquired rexam u.k. defined benefit plan; approximately $150 million less cash inflows from working capital due to the sale of the company's legacy european business at its peak working capital requirements; $90 million of payments to settle derivatives associated with the acquired rexam business; and $50 million of additional interest payments associated with the financing of the rexam acquisition. inventory days on hand increased from 49 days to 68 days, days sales outstanding increased from 35 days to 46 days and days payable outstanding increased from 82 days to 97 days. the increase in days outstanding is primarily attributable to the working capital positions of the acquired rexam operations as compared to the legacy ball operations included in the divestment business.
we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable. programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to ball, had combined limits of approximately $1.0 billion at december 31, 2017. a total of $439 million and $374 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 36.5 cents per share in 2017, and 26 cents per share in each of 2016 and 2015, as retrospectively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that was effective on may 16, 2017. total dividends paid to common shareholders were $129 million in 2017, $83 million in 2016 and $72 million in 2015. we paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $5 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2015. no dividends were paid to noncontrolling interests in 2016.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately $440 million of our cash was held outside of the u.s. in the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the u.s. for purposes within the u.s., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the u.s. where we have cash, other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert egyptian pounds held by the company in egypt with a u.s. dollar equivalent value of $51 million into other currencies. the company believes its u.s. operating cash flows; the $1.2 billion available under the company's long-term, revolving credit facilities; the $110 million available under other u.s.-based uncommitted short-term credit facilities; and availability under u.s.-based committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the u.s. portion of the company's ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on u.s. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other u.s. cash requirements. if foreign funds would be needed for our u.s. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we would be required to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the u.s. with the introduction of a modified territorial tax system in the recently enacted u.s. tax cuts
34
and jobs act, the company is currently reviewing its previously stated intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the u.s. as the company does not believe a reasonable estimate of the impact of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion can be determined at present, no provisional estimate is recorded in the financial statements for the period ended december 31, 2017. when either a reasonable estimate or the final determination becomes available, the impact will be recorded in that same reporting period. the final determination will be made and the impact will be recorded no later than december of 2018.
based on its previous indefinite reinvestment assertion, the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. retained earnings in non-u.s. subsidiaries were $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2017. while it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable if these earnings were remitted to the u.s., as a result of the company's inclusion of a provisional transition tax estimate, u.s. tax has been accrued with respect to this amount.
share repurchases the company's share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $76 million in 2017, $59 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2015. the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.     debt facilities and refinancing given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. total interest-bearing debt was $7 billion at december 31, 2017, compared to $7.5 billion at december 31, 2016.
in anticipation of the june 2016 acquisition of rexam, the company entered into a £3.3 billion bridge facility in february 2015. additionally, in december 2015, ball issued $1 billion of 4.375 percent senior notes, €400 million of 3.5 percent senior notes and €700 million of 4.375 percent senior notes. the company elected to restrict these proceeds in an escrow account, which enabled the reduction of its bridge facility to £1.9 billion.
in march 2016, ball refinanced in full its then existing £1.9 billion bridge facility with a $1.4 billion term a loan facility available to ball and a €1.1 billion term a loan facility available to a subsidiary of ball, and refinanced in full its then existing revolving credit facility with a long-term, multi-currency revolver available until march 2021. the euro term a loan was repaid during 2017.
at december 31, 2017, taking into account outstanding letters of credit, approximately $1.2 billion was available under the company's long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until march 2021. in addition to these facilities, the company had $751 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31, 2017, of which $340 million was outstanding and due on demand. the majority of these amounts are available without violating our existing debt covenants. at december 31, 2016, the company had $143 million outstanding under short-term uncommitted credit facilities.
while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31, 2017, and for all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. the u.s. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. the most restrictive of the company's debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 4 times at december 31, 2017. the company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at december 31, 2017 and 2016, and we have met all debt payment obligations. as of december 31, 2017, the amounts disclosed as available under the company's long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities, the short-term uncommitted
35
credit facilities and the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, are available without violating our existing debt covenants. additional details about our debt are available in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
other liquidity measures free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure to: (1) evaluate the company's liquidity, (2) evaluate strategic investments, (3) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. free cash flow is not a defined term under u.s. gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.
based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:
years ended december 31,
($ in millions)                               2017                           2016                2015

based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2018 to be in the range of $1.5 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million. in 2018, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects, dividend payments, stock buybacks and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. of the total 2018 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $465 million was contractually committed as of december 31, 2017.
commitments cash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31, 2017, are summarized in the following table:

(c)for variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company.
(d)the company's purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. in cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, management's best estimates have been used. depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.

the table above does not include $84 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.
contributions to the company's defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded german, swedish and certain u.s. plans, are expected to be in the range of $46 million in 2018. this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be approximately $397 million to $416 million for each of the years ending december 31, 2018 through 2022 and a total of $2.2 billion for the years 2023 through 2027. payments to participants in the unfunded german, swedish and certain u.s. plans are expected to be approximately $17 million to $21 million in each of the years 2018 through 2022 and a total of $80 million for the years 2023 through 2027.
based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2018, excluding settlement and curtailment losses, is anticipated to be approximately $20 million lower than in 2017. a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $15 million increase in the 2018 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $3 million reduction of pension expense in 2018. additional details about our defined benefit pension plans are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

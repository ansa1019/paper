general operating comments
2017 marked the company's 20th consecutive year of improved revenues and profits. revenues for the year rose 6.4 percent to $1.674 billion compared to $1.573 billion for the prior year. income before income taxes increased 13.0% to $294.5 million compared to $260.6 million the prior year. net income increased 7.0% to $179.1 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.82 compared to $167.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share for the prior year.
the company's 2017 net income was negatively affected by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") which was signed in to law on december 22, 2017. the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the tcja was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income. the $11.6 million increase in tax was as follows: $8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. this resulted in a $0.05 per diluted share decrease in net income for the year.
net income excluding the effect of the tcja increased 13.9% to $190.7 million or $0.87 per share. net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the effect of the tcja are non-gaap financial measures. management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these on reported results.
all of the company's business lines experienced growth for the year, with residential pest control revenues up 6.4%, commercial pest control revenues up 5.1% and termite and ancillary services revenues up 9.7%.
14
during the year, the company increased its presence around the world with the addition of 11 new orkin international franchises. hometeam pest defense announced that they had reached one million taexx® installations. we acquired northwest exterminating based in marietta, ga which contributed in the growth of the company's revenues the last five months. strategic acquisitions remain a priority for rollins. the company also continued to improve our routing and scheduling capabilities as we utilize our customer service manager ("csm") boss and its virtual route management feature. boss has been fully implemented in the orkin's u.s. operations.
strategic acquisitions remain a priority for rollins, and as in the past, we will continue to seek out companies that are a "fit" for us in both, the pest control and wildlife areas of our business.

revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $1.674 billion, an increase of $100.5 million or 6.4% from 2016 revenues of $1.573 billion. growth occurred across all service lines and brands with our canadian and australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. organic growth and pricing accounted for approximately 4.5% of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth. commercial pest control represented approximately 40% of the company's revenue in 2017 and grew 5.1% due to increases in sales, an emphasis on closing leads, increased bed bug revenue, and acquisitions. commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange as orkin canada and rollins australia are heavily commercial. residential pest control, which represented approximately 42% of the company's revenue, increased 6.4% driven by an increase in lead closure, pricing, as well as increased taexx® homebuilder installations, and acquisitions. the company's termite business, which represented approximately 18% of the company's revenue, grew 9.7% in 2017 due to acquisitions, increases in drywood fumigations and ancillary service sales, (such as moisture control and insulation).
the company implemented its traditional price increase program in june 2017. less than 2% of the company's revenue increase is attributable to pricing actions. approximately 80% of the company's pest control revenue was recurring in 2017 as well as 2016.
the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2017 for a total of 81 orkin international franchises, two canadian critter control franchises, and eleven australian franchises operated by murray pest control and scientific pest management at december 31, 2017, compared to 70 orkin international franchises, two canadian critter control franchises and seven australian franchises at december 31, 2016.
international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the company's revenues for 2017. orkin had 128 and 120 franchises (domestic and international) at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company had 89 critter control franchises at december 31, 2017, down 5 from 2016. critter control operations, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, has begun the process of purchasing critter control franchises. revenue from franchises was down 2.9% in 2017 compared to 2016 as we acquire franchises from critter control.
cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 cost of services provided increased $47.6 million or 6.2%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. gross margin for the year increased to 51.0% for 2017 compared to 50.9% for 2016 due to favorable service salary cost as we utilize boss, our crm and operating system and vrm to improve our customer routing and scheduling to maximize efficiencies. we had lower administrative salaries as we maximize our efficiencies and lower insurance and claims as we saw reductions in our actuarial calculations on future losses and lower vehicle loss expenses. the favorable margins were partially offset by higher fleet costs as gasoline prices rose and leased vehicle costs as we replace our fleet and materials and supplies as we increase termite treatments. we experienced good cost controls across most spending categories during 2017 compared to 2016.
15
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization increased $5.7 million, or 11.2% compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. the dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $2.7 million or 10.7% as we continue to depreciate our crm software boss, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.0 million or 11.5% for 2017 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts of northwest exterminating, as well as several other acquisitions over the last year.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $12.9 million, or 2.6% compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. sg&a decreased to 30.1% of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 31.2% in 2016. the company had a one-time tax event to dissolve its subsidiary, kinro investment inc. in 2016. this increased sg&a expense $9.1 million or 0.6 percentage points due to the one-time tax event that was offset as a credit in income tax expense. administrative salaries were relatively flat to prior year as we reduced the number of temporary personnel working on the boss system. personnel related costs were marginally lower as we experienced leveling of our premiums. gains in these areas were partially offset by higher sales salaries, fleet expense, and contractor expenses for various projects as well as the aforementioned 2016 foreign tax withholding expense.
gain on sales of assets, net gain on sales of assets, net decreased to $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $0.8 million in 2016. the company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and owned property in 2017 and 2016.
interest income, net interest income, net for each of the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. interest income for each year is due to interest received on cash balances in the company's various cash accounts.
taxes the company's effective tax rate increased to 39.2% in 2017 compared to 35.8% in 2016, due primarily to the effects of the tcja in 2017, a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences in state and foreign income taxes. the estimated impact of the enactment of the tcja was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income. the $11.6 million increase in tax was as follows: ($8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation). the increase due to the tcja was partially offset by a reduction related to the implementation of asu 2016-09 that was a $4.0 million benefit. management believes that the corporate tax rate in 2018 will be in the mid 20% range with a lower rate in the first quarter 2018 adjusted throughout the year to the mid 20% range for the year.

critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
19
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing, increased driver training and a post-injury nurse triage program for employees.
revenue recognition-the company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. for pest control customers, the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
all revenues are reported net of sales taxes.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
defined benefit pension plans - in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. defined benefit plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan to the company's financial statements. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 "compensation- retirement benefits", and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
20
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. the company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company utilizes a yield curve approach. the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. the discount rate was 4.0% as of december 31, 2017 compared to 4.45% in 2016 and 4.7% in 2015. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.
as set forth in note 14 to the company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2009-12 "investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)," these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.
as of december 31, 2017, the defined benefit plans were fully-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by $19.0 million before tax and $14.2 million after tax.

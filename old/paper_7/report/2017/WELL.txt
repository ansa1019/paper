business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our relevant investments to help mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, rental income and resident fees/services represented 33% and 64%, respectively, of total revenues.  substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees/services, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions, and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real
29
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances, and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, and general and administrative expenses.  depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. at december 31, 2017, we had $243,777,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $65,526,000 of restricted cash and $2,258,635,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.
key transactions capital.  during the year ended december 31, 2017, we extinguished $1,080,268,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.2%.  in addition, we redeemed all 11,500,000 shares of our 6.5% series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock.  also, for the year ended december 31, 2017, we raised $611,443,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our equity shelf program (as defined below).  the capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility and proceeds from dispositions, supported new investment activity for the year.

operating performance. we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the statement of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo"), consolidated net operating income ("noi") and same store noi ("ssnoi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

credit strength. we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and internal revenue code ("irc") section 1031 deposits. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("aebitda"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations, and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods.  renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position, and/or achieve property stabilization.  generally, these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions, primarily in our seniors housing operating segment.
financing activities. the changes in net cash provided from financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock, and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions in 2017."  please refer to notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for our leverage and coverage ratio trends.  our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2017, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged.  we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
on may 1, 2015, we filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") (1) an open-ended automatic or "universal" shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan ("drip") under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. as of january 31, 2018, 2,108,286 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the drip registration statement. we have entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of morgan stanley & co. llc, merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated, goldman sachs & co. llc, ubs securities llc and wells fargo securities, llc relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $1,000,000,000 aggregate amount of our common stock ("equity shelf program"). the equity shelf program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements.  we expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive per share cash proceeds at settlement equal to the forward sale price under the relevant forward sale agreement.  however, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward share agreement.  as of january 31, 2018, we had $784,083,000 of remaining capacity under the equity shelf program and there were no outstanding forward sales agreements. depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt, and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

the 2017 decrease in rental income is primarily attributable to the disposition of properties exceeding new acquisitions and conversions of newly constructed triple-net properties. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index ("cpi") and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the cpi do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2017, we had no triple-net lease renewals but we had 25 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.15% to 0.36% in our triple-net portfolio. the 2017 decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during 2016 and 2017 and the 2016 increase is attributable to higher loan volumes during the majority of 2016.

total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees.  the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. the following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

depreciation and amortization decreased in 2017 primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.  changes in gains on sales of properties are related to the volume of property sales and the sales prices.  during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment charges totaling $96,909,000 related to 21 properties, $20,169,000 related to 22 properties, and $2,220,000 related to two properties, respectively.
the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in "critical accounting policies" below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.  during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to genesis healthcare ("genesis") of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, other expenses primarily represents non-capitalizable transaction costs, including $88,316,000 related to a joint venture transaction with an existing seniors housing operator, including the conversion of properties from triple-net to seniors housing operating, an exchange of propco/opco interests and termination/restructuring of pre-existing relationships.
in april 2011, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned genesis.  in conjunction with this transaction, we received the option to acquire an ownership interest in genesis.  in february 2015, genesis closed on a transaction to merge with skilled healthcare group to become a publicly traded company which required us to record the value of the derivative asset due to the net settlement feature.  this event resulted in $58,427,000 gain. during the fourth quarter of 2015, the cost basis of this investment exceeded the fair value.  management performed an assessment to determine whether the decline in fair value was other than temporary and concluded that it was.  as a result, we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of $35,648,000 which was recorded in other expense.  during the fourth quarter of 2017, management recorded an additional other than temporary charge of $18,294,000 in other expenses on the genesis equity investment.
a portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships.  income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

the increases in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties from which we receive rent. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the cpi.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if the cpi does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  revenue from real property that is sold would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that revenues from sold properties exceed those from new acquisitions, we would experience decreased revenues.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2017, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 79,129 square feet of new leases and 270,505 square feet of renewals.  the weighted-average term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $32.92 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $11.43 per square foot.  substantially all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in cpi to 3.5%.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating expenses.  the fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan loss related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses discussed in "critical accounting policies" below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.  during 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell.

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, primarily the $450,000,000 of 4.70% senior unsecured notes extinguished in december 2016.  please refer to note 10 to consolidated financial statements for additional information.  the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 is primarily due to the early extinguishment of the 2016 senior unsecured notes. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes. the change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes.  please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility.
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 2.83%, 3.63% and 3.82%, respectively.  the 2017 decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily related to a reduction in professional service fees for tax and legal consulting and compensation costs as a result of execution of our strategic initiatives.
other expenses for 2017 primarily represents $40,730,000 of costs related to finalization of an agreement with the university of toledo foundation to transfer our corporate headquarters as a donation. other expenses for all years also includes severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees.  during 2017, we incurred expenses totaling approximately $3,811,000 in connection with the litigation captioned welltower v. brinker, case no. g-4801-ci-0201702692-000 (ct. common pleas, toledo, ohio).  these expenses were offset by: 1) $4,000,000 we received pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the litigation; and 2) approximately $2,848,000 that mr. brinker was owed under his separation agreement with us, which was forgiven pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the litigation. other expenses in 2015 also included costs associated with the termination of our investment in a strategic outpatient medical partnership.
the fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to benefits recognized in the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the release of a valuation allowance reserve on a taxable subsidiary and the restructuring of an unconsolidated investment. the decrease in preferred dividends and the preferred stock redemption charge are due to the redemption of our 6.5% series j preferred stock during the three months ended march 31, 2017.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics"), as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda ("aebitda") to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
consolidated net operating income ("noi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical facility properties.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance.  general and administrative expenses (excluded from noi) represent costs unrelated to property operations.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses, and depreciation of corporate fixed assets.  same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to january 1, 2015.  land parcels, loans, sub-leases and major capital restructurings as well as any properties acquired, developed/redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts.  we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. covenants in our senior unsecured notes contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements. failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed aebitda, which represents ebitda as defined above excluding unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. we use aebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents aebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.
our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits or other companies.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions.  management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:
·         the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
·         the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.  management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future.  however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change.  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.  please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires that revenue be recognized after   we evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations including, four basic criteria are met. these four criteria include persuasive evidence    but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the financial of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable income      strength of the investment's underlying operations as measured by cash flows and reasonably assured collectability. if the collectability of revenue is      and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and guaranties, determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could     and current economic conditions.

escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days' notice.

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk      we are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures.  we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible. we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates. this section is a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. for more information, see notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire, construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties. then, as market conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.  we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited.
a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. interest rate changes, however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt or equity, or repaid by the sale of assets. to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates to determine the instruments' change in fair value. the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated (in thousands):

our variable rate debt, including our primary unsecured credit facility, is reflected at fair value. at december 31, 2017, we had $2,294,678,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt. assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of $22,947,000. at december 31, 2016, we had $2,311,996,000 outstanding under our variable rate debt. assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of $23,120,000.
we are subject to currency fluctuations that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and results of operations. increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the u.s. dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom. based solely on our results for the year ended december 31, 2017, including the impact of existing hedging arrangements, if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, our net income from these investments would increase or decrease, as applicable, by less than $12,000,000.  we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with non-u.s. denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts.  if we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and health care properties outside the u.s., we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than u.s. dollars, canadian dollars or british pounds sterling. to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments' change in fair value.  the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed, excluding cross currency hedge activity (dollars in thousands):

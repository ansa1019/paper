more specifically, we refer you to the sections titled special note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of part i of this report and risk factors set forth in item 1a of this report, as well as in other subsequent reports we file with the securities and exchange commission, for a more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently than expected or anticipated. these reports are available publicly on the securities and exchange commission website, www.sec.gov, and on our website, www.steeldynamics.com under "investors - sec filings".
operating statement classifications net sales.  net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products.  except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the time the title of the product transfers, upon shipment. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in the estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues utilizing a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold.  our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.
selling, general and administrative expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. these costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, and property taxes. company-wide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statement of operations.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest.  interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other expense (income), net.  other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments; any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.

2017 overview our consolidated results for 2017 benefited from improved demand in the domestic steel market, resulting in record steel shipments and sales compared to 2016, improved metal spreads from increased selling prices, and a resulting 19% increase in operating income. underlying domestic steel consumption increased in 2017, as the construction and energy markets continued to improve throughout the year, the heavy and off-road equipment and general industrial manufacturing markets improved, and the automotive markets remained strong. however, steel imports rose again in 2017, most notably in structural and fabricated structural, but also in cold roll and coated sheet. supported by increased domestic steel mill utilization compared to 2016, our metals recycling operations were able to maintain consistent volume and realize increased ferrous metal spreads, while also further reducing operating costs, resulting in improved operating income of almost 250%. the non-residential construction market continued to strengthen, resulting in record steel fabrication sales and shipments, however increasing selling prices were outpaced by higher steel input costs, resulting in compressed metal spread.
our 2017 performance, both operationally and financially was one of steel dynamics, inc. best years. we achieved numerous annual records, while continuing to focus on and improve company-wide safety.
summary of significant achievements within our annual 2017 results:
·   record steel operations shipments of 9.7 million tons

·   record steel fabrication operations shipments of over 627,000 tons

·   record consolidated net sales of $9.5 billion

·   record consolidated operating income of $1.1 billion, and pretax income of $935 million

consolidated operating income for 2017 increased $206.1 million, or 24%, to $1.1 billion, compared to $860.8 million in 2016, which excludes $132.8 million of non-cash asset impairment charge. net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. for 2017 increased $354.1 million, or 77%, to $812.7 million, compared to 2016. diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics, inc. for 2017 was $3.36, compared to $1.56 for 2016. included in net income for 2017 was a one-time tax benefit of $180.6 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, resulting from our revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the u.s. federal tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, and net income for 2016 was reduced by $76.4 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, of non-cash asset impairment charge.
2016 overview our consolidated results for 2016 benefited from positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment during the year, driving improved sheet steel volume and metal spreads, as well as increased metal spread and operating cost reductions in our metals recycling operations. underlying domestic steel consumption remained relatively consistent, as the automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year, while heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets remained weak. sheet steel import levels declined during 2016 as compared to 2015, amidst the duties that were levied during 2016 pursuant to the trade cases filed with the united states international trade commission, and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical averages. domestic steel mill utilization rates were flat in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting in lower ferrous volumes in our metals recycling operations, our metal spreads improved, particularly in nonferrous materials, and we benefited from continued operational cost containment efforts. the non-residential construction market for our steel fabrication operations was strong, resulting in record shipments; however, average selling prices contracted, outpacing declining steel input costs, resulting in compressed metal spread during 2016.
in the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $127.3 million non-cash asset impairment charge, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. also, during the fourth quarter of 2016, a $5.5 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a third-party pertaining to certain omnisource long-lived assets (classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31, 2016), inventory and spare parts. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a pretax non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill - $341.3 million, indefinite-lived intangible assets - $68.5 million, and certain other assets - $10.3 million, associated with omnisource. this impairment charge reduced 2015 operating income by $428.5 million, and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $268.7 million.
excluding the impact of the $132.8 million and $428.5 million in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges in 2016 and 2015, respectively, consolidated operating income increased $505.1 million, or 142%, to $860.8 million in 2016, compared to $355.7 million in 2015, and net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. increased $320.3 million, or 232%, to $458.6 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, during 2016, compared with net income of $138.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, during 2015. the impact of the $132.8 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charges, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, reduced 2016 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $76.4 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.31. the impact of the $428.5 million pretax non-cash asset impairment charge reduced 2015 net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $268.7 million and our diluted earnings per share by $1.11.

underlying domestic steel consumption increased in 2017, as the construction and energy markets continued to improve throughout the year, the heavy and off-road equipment and general industrial manufacturing markets improved, and the automotive markets remained strong, as we continued to gain market share in this market, particularly at our columbus flat roll division. with domestic steel consumption increasing in 2017 over 2016, steel imports, particularly for long products but also cold roll and coated sheet, rose over 15% from 2016 levels, representing 27% of 2017 domestic consumption. in spite of increased imports, our steel mills utilization rate increased to 92% in 2017, as compared to 87% in 2016, with increases in both our sheet and long products steel utilization rates. our steel utilization rates continue to outpace our domestic competitors, which averaged 74% during 2017, due to our diversified value-added product offerings. net sales for the steel operations increased 22% in 2017, when compared to 2016, due to a 4% increase in steel operations shipments combined with an increase of $110 per ton, or 17%, in average selling prices. sheet steel average selling prices increased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016, while long products rose 10%.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 60% of our steel operations' manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of the techs and vulcan, which purchase, rather than produce, the steel they further process. our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased $73, or 33%, compared to the same period in 2016, consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing.
32
operating income for the steel operations increased 19%, to a record $1.1 billion, in 2017, compared to 2016, due to an 8% increase in metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed) on higher selling prices, coupled with increased steel shipments.
segment results 2016 vs. 2015
overall steel operations performance in 2016 compared to 2015 benefited from positive momentum throughout the year in the sheet steel supply environment, as the excessively high levels of steel imports experienced in 2015 and 2014 declined approximately 15% in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. duties levied in 2016 pursuant to the trade case rulings from the united states international trade commission, coupled with low customer inventories compared to historical levels, precipitated higher domestic steel shipments and higher utilization for our steel mills. our steel mills utilization rate improved to 87% for 2016, as compared to 79% in 2015, with our sheet steel utilization rate improving to 99% in 2016 from 86% in 2015. the domestic steel demand outlook remained relatively unchanged throughout 2016, as automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year, while heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets remained challenged. overall steel selling prices improved during the last three quarters of 2016 from the significant decline that occurred throughout 2015 and early 2016 as sheet steel imports declined. net sales for the steel operations increased 8% in 2016, when compared to 2015, as an 11% increase in steel operations shipments more than offset a decrease of $15 per ton, or 2%, in average selling prices.
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased $35, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015, consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing.
operating income for the steel operations increased 130%, to $927.0 million, in 2016, compared to 2015, due to an 11% increase in steel shipments coupled with a 5% increase in overall steel operations metal spread expansion. sheet steel metal spread expanded 15%, while long products metal spread contracted 9%, as domestic overcapacity and an aggressive competitive environment continued.

segment results 2017 vs. 2016
the overall non-residential construction market continued to improve throughout 2017, demonstrating a positive growth profile, as our fabrication operations achieved record shipments in 2017. net sales of $824.4 million for the segment increased $120.9 million, or 17%, in 2017, compared to 2016, as volumes increased 11% and selling prices increased 5%. our steel fabrication operations continued to realize strength in order activity and resulting shipments, as we continued to leverage our national operating footprint to sustain and improve market share, and market demand continued to improve.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, generally representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. the average cost of steel consumed increased by 15% in 2017, consistent with increased selling prices discussed in the steel operations results, as compared to 2016, while average selling prices increased only 5%, resulting in metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracting 5%. operating income decreased 4% to $87.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as increased shipments were more than offset by metal spread contraction.

segment results 2016 vs. 2015
the non-residential construction market was strong during 2016; however, decreased annual selling prices outpaced decreased overall steel input costs, resulting in metal spread compression. as a result of record shipments, which more than offset decreased selling prices, net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased $30.1 million, or 4%, in 2016, compared to 2015. metal spread declined 10% in 2016, compared to 2015, as a $116 per ton, or 8%, decrease in average selling prices outpaced a 7% decrease in the average cost of steel consumed. this resulted in a 22% decrease in operating income to $91.0 million in 2016, as compared to $115.9 million in 2015.

other operations other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our idled minnesota ironmaking operations and smaller joint ventures. also included in "other" are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company's senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses.
during the fourth quarter of 2016 impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
consolidated results 2017 vs. 2016
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $394.6 million during 2017 increased 6% from $374.0 million during 2016, representing approximately 4.1% and 4.8% of net sales, respectively. the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, associated with our increased profitability. profit sharing of $91.3 million in 2017, increased $21.0 million, or 28% over 2016, with our increased profitability.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2017, interest expense decreased $11.6 million to $134.4 million, when compared to 2016. the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our senior notes outstanding. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we called and repaid $400.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2019 with 5.000% senior notes due 2026. also in the fourth quarter of 2016, we early paid off the remaining $228.1 million of outstanding senior term loan debt. in addition, in the second half of 2017, we called and repaid our $350.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2022 with 4.125% senior notes due 2025.
other expense (income), net. net other income of $2.8 million in 2017 included $14.6 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2022, which were more than offset by other income, primarily interest. net other expense of $17.8 million in 2016 included $16.5 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2019.
income tax expense (benefit).  during 2017, our income tax expense was $129.4 million at an effective income tax rate of 13.8%, as compared to income tax expense of $204.1 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 36.2% during 2016. the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due primarily to a one-time $180.6 million net federal tax benefit resulting from our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, and discrete tax benefits related to valuation allowance reductions, state tax refunds and equity-based compensation.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $16.7 million at december 31, 2017, are potential benefits of $12.5 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense of $85,000, net of tax.  in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $4.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2017.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. we are subject to examination and proposed adjustments by the irs for years 2010 and thereafter.  at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits, and state income tax audits. based on the current audits in process, the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to $3.3 million by the end of 2018. with the exception of the 2010 and 2011 federal returns, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2012.
consolidated results 2016 vs. 2015
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $374.0 million during 2016 increased 14% from $328.8 million during 2015, representing approximately 4.8% and 4.3% of net sales, respectively. the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, associated with our increased profitability. profit sharing of $71.3 million in 2016, increased $48.2 million over 2015, with our increased profitability.
35
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2016, interest expense decreased $7.9 million to $146.0 million, when compared to 2015. the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the call and prepayment of our $350.0 million 7 5/8% senior notes due 2020, in the first quarter of 2015.
other expense (income), net. during 2016, net other expense of $17.8 million included $16.5 million of expenses associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2019. net other expense of $15.4 million in 2015 includes $16.7 million of expenses associated with tender and call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2020.
income tax expense (benefit). during 2016, our income tax expense was $204.1 million at an effective income tax rate of 36.2%, as compared to a benefit of $96.9 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 40.0% during 2015. the lower effective tax rate in 2016 was due primarily to benefits from other permanent tax benefit items, most notably the 2016 domestic manufacturing deduction, available in years with taxable income.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long‐term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and acquisitions. we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2017, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents           $1,028,649
revolver availability           1,188,082
total liquidity                $2,216,731
our total outstanding debt increased $22.1 million during 2017, due to additional revolving credit facility borrowings at one of our controlled subsidiaries. our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) decreased to 41.9% at december 31, 2017, from 44.9% at december 31, 2016.
in september 2017, we issued $350.0 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 notes"), the proceeds of which, along with available cash, were used to fund the september 2017 tender to purchase at a redemption price of 103.563%, $182.9 million principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, of our 6.375% senior notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes"), and the october 2017 call and repayment at a redemption price of 103.188% of the $167.1 million remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2022 notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repayment.
our november 2014 senior secured credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion revolver, matures november 2019. subject to certain conditions, we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least $750.0 million. the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries; and is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries' receivables and inventories, and by pledges of all shares of our wholly-owned subsidiaries' capital stock or other equity interests, and intercompany debt held by us as collateral. the revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions, or enter into other specified transactions and activities. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2017, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $11.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a net debt (as defined in the facility) to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00 must be maintained. if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. at december 31, 2017, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 10.75:1.00 and 1.35:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2017, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
36
working capital. we generated cash flow from operations of $739.6 million in 2017. operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) increased $250.7 million to $1.6 billion at december 31, 2017. increases in volumes, pricing and profitability have resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory, which have been partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. operational working capital as a percentage of annual net sales is 16.3% at december 31, 2017, as compared to 16.7% at december 31, 2016.
capital investments. during 2017, we invested $164.9 million in property, plant and equipment, compared with $198.2 million during 2016. our current estimated 2018 cash allocation plan includes the investment of approximately $250 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.155 per share in the first quarter 2017 (from $0.140 per share in 2016), resulting in declared cash dividends of $148.2 million during 2017, compared to $136.5 million during 2016. we paid cash dividends of $145.6 million and $135.8 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. in addition, the terms of our facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay.
other. during october 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $450 million of our common stock. under the share repurchase program, purchases will take place, as and when, we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions.  the share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time. we acquired 7.4 million shares of our common stock for $252.2 million during 2017, and 732,000 shares for $25.0 million during 2016, leaving $172.7 million available pursuant to this program. see part ii other information, item 5 market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including if necessary borrowings under our revolver through its term, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.
during 2017, we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately $10.8 million. based on our current abatements and incentive credits, and utilizing our existing long-lived asset structure, we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately $10.7 million, $9.4 million, $3.6 million, $3.5 million, $3.4 million, $3.0 million, and $2.6 million during the years 2018 through 2024, respectively.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles. based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. it does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary course of business. the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2017 (in thousands):

payments due by period total                           2018         2019 &amp; 2020         2021 &amp; 2022          2023 &amp; after long-term debt (1)                        $2,408,852                   $28,795                  $6,783                $706,882                $1,666,392

(1)the long-term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes remain outstanding until maturity. refer to note 3 long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions, and our long-term debt.
37
(2)the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 5.125% on our $700.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021; 51/4% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due april 2023; 5.500% on our $500.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024; 4.125% on our $350.0 million senior unsecured notes due september 2025; 5.00% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due december 2026; 0.225% commitment fee on our available revolver; and an average of 4.8% on our other debt of $58.9 million.
(3)purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity, natural gas and its transportation, fuel, air products, electrodes, and zinc. these arrangements have "take or pay" or other similar commitment provisions. we have utilized such "take or pay" requirements during the past three years under these contracts, except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which have been idle since may 2015.
(4)construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2017.
(5)other commitments principally relate to deferred compensation plan obligations.
(6)we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $21.5 million as of december 31, 2017, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.    other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2017, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $39.1 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $2.9 million. of the costs incurred during 2017 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 77% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $623,000 at all of our facilities during 2017. we have an accrual of $2.9 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change. critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts. except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and customer claims from these sales at the time title of the product transfers, upon shipment. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract. the allowance for doubtful accounts for all operating segments is based on our best estimate of probable credit losses, along with historical experience, which estimates may or may not prove accurate.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors, including the construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to
38
steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks, historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers. we mitigate our exposure to credit risk, which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
inventories. we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold.  if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, further write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing.
impairments of long-lived tangible and definite‐lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic climate in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell. an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company reported $8.7 million and $29.3 million, respectively, of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet.  an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell.  for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell. the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820, consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management's own assumptions.
significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations. the company therefore undertook a fourth quarter 2016 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily our mining resources and mesabi mining operation's fixed assets. with the company's outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows, the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable, and they were in fact impaired. this 2016 assessment resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at that time as determined primarily on the cost approach, as well as expected future discounted cash flows (an income approach), using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.    our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 (in thousands):

at least once annually (as of october 1) or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. we utilize a two-stepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment. the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment. in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (which includes goodwill). the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by

using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the company performs the second step of the test, which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded. in the second step, the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated. if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
at least once annually (as of october 1) or when indicators of impairment exist, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount.  the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk-adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows (income approach).  if the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value.
our fourth quarter 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges.  management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing. otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.
in 2016, a $5.5 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a third-party pertaining to certain omnisource long-lived assets (classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31, 2016), inventory and spare parts, as provided under asc 350.
during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value, and upon the completion of the impairment analysis, that the goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived assets were impaired. the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values, resulting in pretax non-cash asset impairment charges of $341.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015, within the metals recycling operations.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

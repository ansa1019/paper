overview company background we are a leading innovator of sensory experiences, co-creating unique products that consumers taste, smell, or feel in fine fragrances and cosmetics, detergents and household goods, and food and beverages. we take advantage of our capabilities in consumer insights, research and product development ("r&d"), creative expertise and customer intimacy to partner with our customers in developing innovative and differentiated offerings for consumers. we believe that this collaborative approach will generate market share gains for our customers. our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our flavorists and perfumers.
flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used. as a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. while we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four end-use categories: (1) savory, (2) beverages, (3) sweet and (4) dairy.
we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer products within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries products. our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients. our fragrance compounds are defined into two broad categories, fine fragrances and consumer fragrances. consumer fragrances consists of five end-use categories of products: (1) fabric care, (2) home care, (3) personal wash, (4) hair care and (5) toiletries. fragrance ingredients consist of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, and are included in the fragrances business unit.
the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products. the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients. the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, as well as an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. in 2017, the flavors and fragrances market was estimated by management to be approximately $24.8 billion and is forecasted to grow approximately 2-3% by 2021, primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets.
development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources, including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program. our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. it then becomes a collaborative process among our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
2017 overview our 25 largest customers accounted for 50% of total sales in 2017; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 11% to 12% of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors.
sales in 2017 increased 9% on both a reported and currency neutral basis (which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 5% to both the reported and currency neutral growth rates. flavors achieved reported sales growth of 9% and currency neutral sales growth of 10%, with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 5% to both reported and currency neutral growth rates. fragrances achieved sales growth of 9% on both a reported and currency basis in 2017, with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 5% to both reported and currency neutral growth rates. sales growth excluding acquisitions was driven by new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds. additionally, fragrance ingredients sales were up 8% on a both a reported basis and
33
currency neutral basis, principally driven by higher volumes. overall, our 2017 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 48% of total sales and experienced 4% reported and currency neutral growth in 2017. from a geographic perspective, north america ("noam"), europe, africa and middle east ("eame"), greater asia ("ga") and latin america ("la") all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2017, led by noam.
on january 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of fragrance resources, inc. ("fragrance resources"), a privately-held fragrance company with facilities in germany, north america, france and china, for approximately €143.4 million (approximately $151.9 million). the acquisition is expected to strengthen our fragrances market position in north america and germany. on april 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of columbia phytotechnology, llc d/b/a powderpure ("powderpure"), a processor of all-natural food ingredients, for approximately $54.6 million. powderpure was acquired to expand our expertise and product offerings of clean label solutions within the flavors business. these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our 2017 results.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") that significantly revised the u.s. tax code effective january 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21% and establishing a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the tax act impacted our fourth quarter consolidated results of operations and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods. in particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required the company to record a one-time tax or "toll charge" which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-u.s. subsidiaries. the cash portion of the "toll charge" will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. in addition, the reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.

financial performance overview reported and currency neutral sales for 2017 increased 9% year-over-year (including approximately 5% growth from acquisitions). we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories and geographies and had sales growth in all four regions and in all categories. both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance (net of losses) and the effect of acquisitions. exchange rate variations did not have a material impact on revenue in 2017. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in u.s. dollars versus local currencies. we saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2017.
we believe that market conditions and the macro-economic environment will continue to be volatile in many markets in 2018 but that. overall, there will be slight improvements as compared to recent years. pressures from increasing costs and the impact of a supply chain disruption related to a key ingredient manufactured by basf and used in the flavors and fragrances industry are expected to reduce our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2018. the basf supply chain disruption is not expected to be resolved until the second half of 2018.
on a long-term basis, we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers' businesses.
gross margin decreased 140 basis points ("bps") year-over-year. included in 2017 was $15.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $11.0 million relating to an fda mandated product recall, $1.8 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.5 million of integration related costs, compared to $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs related to operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold included in 2016. excluding these items, adjusted gross margin decreased 80 bps compared to the prior year period. the decrease was principally driven by higher costs including higher claim expense and higher input costs, offset by the favorable impact of productivity initiatives. volumes were slightly higher but were offset by slightly unfavorable mix.
during 2017, the raw material cost environment continued its recent upward trend. we believe that, in 2018, we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories (such as vanilla and citrus), increases related to turpentine and oil derived materials and higher costs on a key ingredient due to the basf supply disruption related to one of our key ingredients. we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement.
operating profit increased $14.1 million to $581.4 million (17.1% of sales) in 2017 compared to $567.4 million (18.2% of sales) in 2016. included in 2017 were restructuring and other charges of $19.7 million, acquisition-related costs of $20.4 million, $11.0 million relating to an fda mandated product recall, reserve for payment of a tax assessment related to commercial rent for prior periods of $5.3 million, integration related costs of $4.2 million, pension settlement charges of $2.8 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $1.8 million, additional charge related to litigation settlement of $1.0 million and gain on sale of fixed assets of $0.2 million. included in 2016 were net legal charges/credits of $48.5 million, acquisition-related costs of $12.2 million, gain on sale of fixed assets of $7.8 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $2.4 million and restructuring and other charges, net of $0.3 million. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $647.4 million (19.0% of sales) for 2017 versus $623.0 million (20.0% of sales) for 2016. the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of sales was principally driven by lower gross margins in 2017. foreign currency changes had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1% in 2017 and an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 2% in 2016.
cash flows from operations were $390.8 million or 11.5% of sales in 2017 as compared to cash flows from operations of $550.1 million, or 17.7% of sales, during 2016. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 is principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) and due to payments on legal claims along with payments for severance, integration and acquisition costs.
35
our capital spend was $129.0 million (3.8% of sales) during 2017. in light of our requirement to begin relocating our fragrance facility in china and the ongoing construction of a new facility in india, we expect that capital spending in 2018 will be about 4.5-5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). during 2017, we received approximately $15.0 million in payments related to the future relocation of our zhejiang ingredients plant and total payments for which are expected to approximate up to $50 million.

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 140 bps, to 56.5% in 2017 compared to 55.1% in 2016. included in cost of goods sold was $15.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $11.0 million related to an fda mandated product recall, $1.8 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, and $0.5 million of integration related costs, in 2017. for 2016, included in costs of goods sold was $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained relatively consistent with the prior year period at 8.4% in 2017 compared to 8.2% in 2016. the slight increase in 2017 was principally driven by recent acquisitions, and, to a lesser extent, incentive compensation.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, decreased 180 bps to 16.4% versus 18.2% (or 15.9% and 16.4% on an adjusted basis in 2017 and 2016, respectively). included in 2017 were commercial real estate tax assessment charges of $5.3 million, acquisition and integration related costs of $4.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, uk pension settlement charge of $1.9 million and net legal charges/credits, principally related to a litigation accrual of $1.0 million, compared to net legal charges/credits, principally related to a litigation accrual of $48.5 million, acquisition related costs of $4.5 million and severance costs related to the termination of a former executive officer of $1.4 million in 2016. during 2017, costs were higher as a result of recently acquired companies, offset by slightly lower legal and professional fees associated with various finance initiatives, and decreases in legal and patent fees.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

2015 severance and contingent consideration charges during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a series of initiatives intended to streamline the company's management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align its capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of its global manufacturing and operations network. as a result, in 2015, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in restructuring and other charges, net, related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that were affected. during 2016, the company recorded a credit of $1.7 million related to the reversal of severance accruals that were determined to be no longer required. separately, in 2015, the company recorded a charge of $7.2 million, included in selling and administrative expenses, associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the aromor acquisition that were triggered by certain of the management structure changes noted above. in addition, during 2017, the company made payments of $0.2 million related to severance and recorded a credit of $2.3 million related to the reversal of severance accruals that were determined to be no longer required.
2017 productivity program on february 15, 2017, we announced that we were adopting a multi-year productivity program designed to improve overall financial performance, provide flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and drive long-term value creation. in connection with this program, we expect to optimize our global footprint and simplify the company's organizational structures globally. in connection with this initiative, the company expects to incur cumulative, pre-tax cash charges of between $30-$35 million, consisting primarily of $24-$26 million in personnel-related costs and an estimated $6 million in facility-related costs, such as lease termination, and integration-related costs.
the company recorded $20.6 million of charges related to personnel-related costs in 2017, with the remainder of the personnel-related and other costs expected to be recognized by the end of 2018. the company made payments of $14.0 million related to severance in 2017. the overall charges were split approximately evenly between flavors and fragrances. this initiative is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 370 members of the company's global workforce, including acquired entities, in various parts of the organization.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses increased to $34.7 million in 2017 compared to $23.8 million in 2016. the increase of $10.9 million is principally due to the acquisitions of fragrance resources and powderpure in 2017, as well as recognizing a full year of amortization in 2017 from the acquisition of david michael as compared to 2016.
operating results by business unit we evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before restructuring and certain non-recurring items, interest expense, other expense, net and taxes on income. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit increased $38.0 million to $375.2 million in 2017 (23.0% of segment sales) from $337.2 million (22.5% of sales) in the comparable 2016 period. the increase in segment profit and profit margin principally reflected productivity initiatives and solid top-line growth.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit increased $1.2 million to $335.4 million in 2017 (19.0% of segment sales), compared to $334.2 million (20.6% of sales) reported in 2016. the increase in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives offset slightly by the impact of acquisitions.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2017, global expenses were $63.2 million compared to $48.5 million during 2016. the increase was principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs.
interest expense in 2017, interest expense increased $12.4 million to $65.4 million, compared to $53.0 million in 2016 reflecting the impact of our issuance of senior notes - 2017 in the second quarter of 2017. average cost of debt was 4.1% for the 2017 period compared to 3.8% in 2016.
other (income) expense, net other income, net increased approximately $11.6 million to $21.0 million of income in 2017 versus $9.4 million of income in 2016. the increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately $13 million in the current year versus approximately $5 million in the prior year, as well as proceeds from certain life insurance policies of approximately $4 million in 2017.

income taxes the effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2017 as compared to 22.7% in 2016. excluding $139.2 million related to the u.s. tax reform, legal charges/credits, net of $0.4 million, acquisition related costs of $6.5 million, gain on sale of assets of $0.1 million, operational improvement initiative costs of $0.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $5.5 million, fda mandated product recall costs of $3.9 million, uk pension settlement charge of $0.5 million, tax assessment of $1.9 million, and integration related costs of $1.3 million, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 20.7%. for 2016, the adjusted tax rate was 23.8% excluding $17.1 million, $4.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal charges/credits, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs, respectively, as well as a $2.7 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property. the year-over-year reduction principally reflects the reversal of certain valuation allowances on u.s. state deferred taxes.
u.s. tax reform on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") that significantly revised the u.s. tax code effective january 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations.
the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods. in particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required us to record a one-time tax or "toll charge" which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-u.s. subsidiaries. the cash portion of the "toll charge" will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. in addition, the reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. given the significant complexity of the tax act, anticipated guidance from the u.s. treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb, the company's provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed. any material revisions in the company's computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.
based on our current assessment and understanding of the tax act and the company's current global operating structure, the company believes its effective tax rate will be approximately 21% in 2018. the impact of the tax act may differ from this estimate, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made, additional guidance that may be issued by the taxing authorities as well as operating and/or structural changes that the company may take as a result of the tax act.
adoption of asc topic 740
effective january 1, 2017, the company prospectively applied new accounting guidance which required all excess tax benefits/deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense/benefit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. this change resulted in a $3.3 million benefit to income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2017. for 2016, benefits of $5.3 million were recognized in equity.
2016 in comparison to 2015
sales sales for 2016 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, sales increased 5%. sales growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds. on both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales were up 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, driven entirely by the impact of acquisitions. overall organic sales growth includes 1% growth from both developed and emerging markets and on a currency neutral basis, 4% growth from emerging markets and 1% growth from developed markets, respectively.

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 20 bps, to 55.1% in 2016 compared to 55.3% in 2015. included in cost of goods sold was $7.6 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs, $2.4 million of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and $0.7 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation in 2016 and $6.8 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs and $1.1 million of costs related to operational improvement initiatives included in 2015.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained relatively consistent with the prior year period at 8.2% in 2016 compared to 8.1% in 2015. the slight increase in 2016 was principally driven by slightly higher salary costs and, to a lesser extent, the effect of recent acquisitions.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, increased 180 bps to 18.2% versus 16.4% (or 16.4% and 16.1% on an adjusted basis in 2016 and 2015, respectively). included in 2016 were net legal charges/credits, principally related to litigation accrual, of $48.5 million, acquisition-related costs of $4.5 million and severance costs related to the termination of a former executive officer of $1.4 million, compared to acquisition related costs of $11.5 million, accelerated contingency payments of $7.2 million and the reversal of the previously recorded provision related to the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million included in 2015. additionally, during 2016, costs were higher as a result of legal and professional fees associated with various finance initiatives and the effect of recently acquired companies, offset by slightly lower salary costs and the effect of foreign currency.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses increased to $23.8 million in 2016 compared to $15.0 million in 2015. the increase of $8.7 million is principally due a full year of amortization in 2016 related to the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer as compared to 2015 as well as the acquisition of david michael in 2016.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit increased $18.8 million to $337.2 million in 2016 (22.5% of sales) from $318.5 million (22.1% of sales) in the comparable 2015 period. the increase in segment profit and profit margin principally reflects productivity initiatives and solid top-line growth.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit increased $12.5 million to $334.2 million in 2016 (20.6% of sales), compared to $321.8 million (20.4% of sales) reported in 2015. the increase in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2016, global expenses were $48.5 million compared to $28.2 million during 2015. the increase is principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs.
interest expense in 2016, interest expense increased $6.9 million to $53.0 million, compared to $46.1 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of borrowings under the euro senior notes - 2016. average cost of debt was 3.8% for the 2016 period compared to 4.5% in 2015.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net increased approximately $12.5 million to $9.4 million of income in 2016 versus $3.2 million of expense in 2015. the increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately $5.0 million in the current year versus losses of approximately $6.0 million in the prior year.

income taxes the effective tax rate was 22.7% in 2016 as compared to 22.2% in 2015. excluding $17.1 million, $4.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal charges/credits, net, acquisition-related costs, operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs, respectively, as well as a $2.7 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property, the adjusted tax rate for 2016 was 23.8%. excluding $6.2 million, $2.3 million and $0.3 million of tax benefits associated with pretax acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives, respectively, a $10.5 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and another jurisdiction as well as a $2.9 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 24.2%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and mix of earnings, which were partially offset by loss provisions.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of $368.0 million at december 31, 2017 compared to $324.0 million at december 31, 2016, of which $286.6 million of the balance at december 31, 2017 was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy. we regularly repatriate, in the form of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the u.s. these repatriations of current year earnings totaled $192.2 million, $134.5 million and $184.6 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the tax act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no u.s. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to u.s. tax and will not be subject to additional u.s. tax when repatriated. we may repatriate a portion of these accumulated earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the u.s., but we do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts.
cash flows from operating activities operating cash flows in 2017 were $390.8 million compared to $550.1 million in 2016 and $467.3 million in 2015. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 was principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) and due to payments on legal claims along with severance, integration and acquisition costs.
working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $1.13 billion at year-end 2017 compared to $0.71 billion at december 31, 2016. this increase in working capital of $417.1 million primarily reflected increases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in short term borrowings as compared to the prior year. in the prior years, current liabilities included a $250 million liability related to the maturity of a payment due on one of our senior notes.
additionally, we continue to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. we estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, there was a beneficial impact on cash provided by operations of approximately $7.6 million, $34 million and $3.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.
cash flows used in investing activities net investing activities in 2017 utilized $299.9 million compared to $355.5 million and $577.2 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease in cash paid for investing activities was primarily driven by lower payments for acquisitions. in 2017, we acquired fragrance resources and powderpure for approximately $137.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $54.2 million (net of cash acquired), respectively, in addition to a purchase price adjustment of $0.7 million related to david michael in 2017. in 2016 we paid approximately $237.5 million for the acquisition of david michael, and in 2015 we paid approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $305.1 million (net of cash acquired), for ottens flavors and lucas meyer, respectively.
additions to property, plant and equipment were $129.0 million, $126.4 million and $101.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively (net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). these investments largely arise from
45
our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand, primarily in emerging markets, and new technology consistent with our strategy.
in light of our requirement to begin relocating our fragrance facility in china and the ongoing construction of a new facility in india, we expect that capital spending in 2018 will be about 4.5-5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows used in financing activities net financing activities in 2017 utilized $42.6 million compared to $34.4 million and $165.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 principally reflected slightly higher debt repayments in 2017 offset by lower treasury share repurchases. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 principally reflected borrowings under the euro senior notes - 2016 which were offset by repayment of our senior notes - 2006 as well as higher dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2016.
at december 31, 2017, we had $1,639.2 million of debt outstanding compared to $1,325.4 million outstanding at december 31, 2016.
we paid dividends totaling $206.1 million, $184.9 million and $158.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.66, $2.40 and $2.06, respectively.
in december 2012, the board of directors authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013. in august 2015, the board of directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31, 2017. based on the total remaining amount of $56.1 million available under the amended repurchase program as of october 31, 2017, the board of directors re-approved on november 1, 2017 a $250.0 million share repurchase authorization and extension for a total value of $300.0 million available under the program. based on the total remaining amount of $295 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 1.9 million shares, or 2.4% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31, 2017) could be repurchased under the program as of december 31, 2017. the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock. the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the pre-approved program according to the share price at that time.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.
during the second quarter of 2017, we acquired powderpure for approximately $54.2 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the first quarter of 2017, we acquired fragrance resources for approximately $137.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired david michael for approximately $237.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the third quarter of 2015, we acquired lucas meyer for approximately $305.1 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the second quarter of 2015, we acquired ottens flavors for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
credit facility and senior notes we supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper.
46
commercial paper commercial paper issued by the company generally has terms of 90 days or less. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no commercial paper outstanding. the revolving credit facility is used as a backstop for the company's commercial paper program. the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2017 and 2016 was $107.5 million and $65 million, respectively.
credit facility there are two tranches under the credit facility. tranche a of the facility is available to borrowers in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately $564.1 million, with a sublimit of $25 million for swing line borrowings. tranche b of the facility is available to borrowers in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately $385.9 million, with sublimits of €50 million and $25 million for swing line borrowings.
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at rate of libor corresponding to the term of the loan plus a margin, currently 112.5 bps, linked to the company's credit rating. the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than 3.50 to 1. based on this ratio, at december 31, 2017 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of $1,530.4 million.
as of december 31, 2017 we had no of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. the amount which we are able to draw down on under the facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. our draw down capacity on the facility was $950 million at december 31, 2017. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility.
at december 31, 2017 and 2016 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio. at december 31, 2017 our net debt/adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 1.59 to 1 as defined by the credit facility, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.
_______________________
(1)   adjusted ebitda and net debt, which are non-gaap measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. in this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda and net debt used by other companies. reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows:

(4)   amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans.
(5)   purchase commitments include agreements for raw material procurement and contractual capital expenditures. amounts for purchase commitments represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.
(6)   this amount represents our provisional estimate of the cash portion of the "toll charge" that will be payable in installments over eight years beginning in 2018. this will be subject to adjustment as we finalize the relevant computations and additional irs rules and guidance on the tax act provisions are adopted.
the table above does not include $38.2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $4.1 million of associated accrued interest. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill. we currently have goodwill of $1.2 billion. in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market-based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 350. the company has identified four reporting units: (1) flavors, (2) fragrance compounds, (3) fragrance ingredients and (4) cosmetic actives ingredients. these reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed by segment management.
49
the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test for the flavors, fragrance compounds, fragrance ingredients and cosmetic actives ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows. if a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the company will record an impairment charge based on that difference, and the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. in january 2017, the fasb issued an amendment to the goodwill impairment guidance which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. effective fiscal year 2017, the company adopted the new guidance and no longer performs the annual goodwill impairment test using the two-step approach. the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2017, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of finite-lived intangible assets. we currently have intangible assets of $415.8 million. the company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes. we account for taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we first determine whether it is "more likely than not" that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. for those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") that significantly revised the u.s. tax code effective january 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations.
the tax act impacted the company's consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact its consolidated results of operations in future periods. in particular, the transition to the new territorial tax system required the company to record a one-time tax or "toll charge" which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of $100.6 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on non-u.s. subsidiaries. the cash portion of the "toll charge" will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018. in addition, the reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of $38.6 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. given the significant complexity of the tax act, anticipated guidance from the u.s. treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb, the company's provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed. any material revisions in the company's computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.
we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.
we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ("prp's") associated with our exposure. recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp's to share such costs.
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.
we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. we derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.
we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31. for the u.s. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody's or standard & poor's with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. for the non-u.s. plans, the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate bonds. consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate. the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable u.s. plans are based on plan experience.
with respect to the u.s. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. the target asset allocation consists of approximately: 20% in equity securities and 80% in fixed income securities. the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 5.9% over the previous 20 years. at december 31, 2017, the actual asset allocation for the u.s. plan was: 1% cash and cash equivalents, 28% in equity securities and 71% in fixed income securities.
the expected rate of return for the non-u.s. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. the target asset allocation, for the non-u.s. plans, consists of approximately: 40% - 70% in fixed income securities; 15% - 40% in equity securities; 5% - 20% in real estate; and 5% - 10% in alternative investments. at december 31, 2017, the actual asset allocation for the non-u.s. plan was: 40% in fixed income investments; 27% in equity investments; 4% in real estate investments, 4% in cash and cash equivalents and 25% in alternative investments.

changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. as of december 31, 2017, we maintained 50% of our inventory as raw materials. materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
new accounting standards in february 2018, fasb issued amendments to the income statement - reporting comprehensive income guidance which allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act, in addition to requiring certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. this guidance is effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2018, with an election to adopt early. the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in august 2017, fasb issued amendments to the derivatives and hedging guidance which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and present hedge ineffectiveness and aligns the presentation of hedge gains and losses with the underlying hedge item. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018. early adoption is permitted. the amended presentation and disclosure requirements should be applied prospectively while the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2017, the fasb issued amendments to the compensation - stock compensation guidance which clarifies changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award that require an entity to apply modification accounting. this guidance is effective, and should be applied prospectively, for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. the company does not expect this guidance to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements as it is not the company's practice to modify the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award after it has been granted.
in march 2017, the fasb issued amendments to the compensation - retirement benefits guidance which requires employers who present a measure of operating income in their statement of income to include only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and postretirement costs in operating expenses. this guidance is effective, and should be applied retrospectively, for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. the company will adopt this standard on january 1, 2018, and expects the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated statement of comprehensive income will be an increase in operating expenses of approximately $30 million and $15 million for the fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. there will be no impact to net income or net income

per share in either period. the new guidance also limits the amount of net periodic benefit cost eligible for capitalization to assets. the new guidance permits only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization.
in january 2017, the fasb issued amendments to the business combination guidance which clarifies the definition of a business in order to assist companies when evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. this guidance will be effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company will apply this guidance for transactions occurring after the effective date.
in october 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows for the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax impact on intra-entity asset transfers, excluding inventory. the company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and accordingly, recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings that reduced other assets and adjusted deferred income taxes by a net amount of approximately $34 million.
in august 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the classification of certain activities within the statement of cash flows. this guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption will be permitted for all entities. the company does not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
in june 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires issuers to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. as such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted for the fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in march 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the treatment of income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. this guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2017. the standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity instead of an operating activity. the company adopted this change retrospectively. the adoption resulted in an $11.8 million, $13.4 million and $22.9 million reclassification from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash provided by financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in addition, the standard requires that excess tax benefits presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows be classified as an operating activity instead of a financing activity. the company adopted this change retrospectively. the adoption resulted in a $3.3 million, $4.7 million and $12.1 million reclassification from net cash provided by financing activities to net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the standard also requires all excess tax benefits/deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense/benefit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. this guidance has been applied prospectively. this change resulted in a $3.3 million benefit to income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2017. for 2016, benefits of $5.3 million were recognized in equity.
in february 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases. the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2018. the company expects to adopt this guidance effective december 30, 2018 and that the adoption of this guidance will result in significant increases to assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. the company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated statement of comprehensive income. the company has begun to evaluate the nature of its leases and has compiled preliminary analysis of the type and location of its leases. the company expects that the significant portion of its leases will relate to property but with additional leases in existence that relate to vehicles and machinery.
revenue recognition - adoption of asc 606
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides for a comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers (asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers) (the "revenue standard"). under the revenue standard, revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
53
this guidance is applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. companies have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated balance sheet. the company has determined that it will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective approach.
the company has substantially completed the evaluation of the revenue standard, including updates to it issued by the fasb, and has adopted the revenue standard on december 30, 2017, the first day of the company's 2018 fiscal year. a cumulative catch up adjustment will be recorded as of that date.
the company creates and manufactures flavors and fragrances. approximately 90% of products, principally flavors compounds and fragrance compounds, are customized to customer specifications and have no alternative use other than sale to the specific customer ("compounds products"). the remaining revenue is derived largely from fragrance ingredient products that, generally, are commodity products with alternative uses and not customized ("ingredients products").
the company's evaluation is substantially complete and was comprised of (i) a detailed review of a large number of documents, including master service, supply, rebate and other similar agreements, and purchase orders, (ii) interviews with regional finance and business personnel on general issues, such as the nature of its larger customer relationships; the nature of potential regional variations; rebates and other price adjustments; upfront costs; and shipping terms and specific issues identified during the review (such as consignment, minimum order quantities, etc.), and (iii) consultation with legal counsel with respect to the nature of various terms within the contracts.
based on this evaluation, with respect to the vast majority of the company's contracts for compounds products, the company will recognize revenue at a point in time. specifically, revenue will be recognized upon transfer of control of the product, as the company does not have an "enforceable right to payment for performance to date" (as set out in section 606-10-25-27 (c) of the standard). with respect to a small number of compounds products customers, the company has determined that it does have an "enforceable right to payment for performance to date" (as set out in section 606-10-25-27 (c) of the revenue standard). for contracts where an enforceable right to payment exists the company will recognize revenue over time using the output method. the calculation of the required cumulative catch up adjustment is in the process of being finalized.
it was determined that no adjustment will be required with respect to revenue related to ingredients products as such products generally have alternative uses and on which the company does not have an enforceable right to payment at all times during the manufacturing process.
in completing its assessment of the adoption of the revenue standard the company elected to combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as a single performance obligation.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses non-gaap financial operating measures in this form 10-k, including: (i) currency neutral sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in u.s. dollars), (ii) adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin (which exclude operational improvement initiatives; acquisition related costs; integration related costs; restructuring and other charges, net; and fda mandated product recall), (iii) adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin (which excludes operational improvement initiatives; acquisition related costs; integration related costs; legal charges/credits, net; tax assessment; restructuring and other charges, net; gain on sale of assets; fda mandated product recall; and uk pension settlement charges), (iv) adjusted selling and administrative expenses (which excludes operational improvement initiatives; acquisition related costs; integration related costs; legal charges/credits, net; tax assessment; restructuring and other charges, net and uk pension settlement charges) and (v) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes operational improvement initiatives; acquisition related costs; integration related costs; legal charges/credits, net; tax assessment; restructuring and other charges, net; gain on sale of assets; cta realization; fda mandated product recall; uk pension settlement charges; and u.s. tax reform). the company also provides the non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the company's debt agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.
we have included each of these non-gaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding
54
these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. we believe such additional non-gaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. in addition, management internally reviews each of these non-gaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. a material limitation of these non-gaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts. we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including gaap measures. these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

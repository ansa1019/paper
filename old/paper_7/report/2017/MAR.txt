item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
business and overview overview we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties in 127 countries and territories under 30 brand names. under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: north american full-service, north american limited-service, and asia pacific. our europe, middle east and africa, and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments.
we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. in most markets, base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue, or certain property-level revenue in the case of franchise fees, while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return. in the middle east and asia, incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves.
our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. in addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.
we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level ("above-property"). our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our loyalty programs, multichannel reservation systems, and desirable property amenities. we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution.
we, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. we address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements.
our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. managed properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. we also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas.

performance measures we believe revpar, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. we also believe occupancy and average daily rate ("adr"), which are components of calculating revpar, are meaningful indicators of our performance. occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property's available capacity. adr, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.
our revpar statistics for 2017, 2016, and 2015, include legacy-starwood comparable properties for each of the full years even though marriott did not own the legacy-starwood brands before the merger date. therefore, our revpar statistics include legacy-starwood properties for periods during which fees from the legacy-starwood properties are not included in our income statements. we provide these revpar statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the u.s. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant u.s. dollar basis. we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period.
we define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the starwood combination, that were open and operating under one of our legacy-marriott or legacy-starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since january 1, 2016 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. for 2017 compared to 2016, we had 3,883 comparable north american properties and 1,030 comparable international properties. for 2016 compared to 2015, we had 3,698 comparable north american properties (including 483 legacy-starwood properties) and 965 comparable international properties (including 506 legacy-starwood properties).
we also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. house profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. house profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.
business trends our 2017 full-year results reflected a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system, including those from the starwood combination, favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world, and slow but steady economic growth. comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2017 increased 3.1 percent to $115.02, adr increased 1.2 percent on a constant dollar basis to $157.12, and occupancy increased 1.4 percentage points to 73.2 percent, compared to 2016.
in north america, revpar increased in 2017, partially driven by higher demand in washington, d.c., growth in transient leisure business, and favorable citywide events and group business in the fourth quarter. revpar was somewhat enhanced by increased demand in impacted areas following the september hurricanes in florida and texas. revpar growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply and only moderate gdp growth.
in our asia pacific segment in 2017, revpar growth was strong in greater china, reflecting improved performance in key markets, as well as in india and thailand. our europe region experienced higher demand in 2017, led by strong transient business in most countries. in our middle east and africa region, demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability, political sanctions on qatar, and lower oil prices, offset by favorable results in south africa. growth in the caribbean and latin america regions reflected strength in mexico and improving leisure demand in the caribbean, but was partially constrained by weak, but improving, economic conditions in many markets in south america. nine managed and franchised caribbean hotels remained closed at year-end 2017 due to significant damage from hurricanes in the region, and we anticipate that two to four of these properties will resume operations in 2018.
we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. our hotels modify the mix of business to improve

revenue as demand changes. for our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.
in 2017 compared to 2016 at comparable properties, worldwide company-operated house profit margins increased by 80 basis points and worldwide company-operated house profit per available room ("hp-par") increased by 5.4 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher revpar, improved productivity, and procurement and synergy savings. north american company-operated house profit margins increased by 40 basis points, and hp-par increased by 2.8 percent. international company-operated house profit margins increased by 130 basis points, and hp-par increased by 8.9 percent.
in the 2017 fourth quarter, we reached new multi-year agreements to amend our relationships with jp morgan chase and american express for our u.s.-issued, co-brand credit cards associated with our loyalty programs. we expect that these agreements will have a favorable impact on our total revenues beginning in 2018.
system growth and pipeline in 2017, we added 473 properties with 76,589 rooms. approximately 39 percent of the added rooms are located outside north america, and 14 percent are conversions from competitor brands. in 2017, 69 properties (12,952 rooms) exited our system.
our global pipeline grew to a record 460,000 rooms at year-end 2017, with over half located outside of north america. the pipeline includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, and nearly 34,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. in 2017, we signed more than 750 management and franchise agreements for new hotels, representing nearly 125,000 rooms. of those room signings, nearly 80 percent were in the industry's three highest-quality tiers -- luxury, upper upscale, and upscale -- which drive significant revenue per available room and fee revenue. contracts signed in 2017 also reflected the growing demand for select service hotels worldwide, with a record 578 contracts signed for our classic select and distinctive select brands, of which 420 are for hotels in north america and 158 are for hotels located outside of north america.
in 2018, we expect the number of our open hotel rooms will increase approximately 7 percent gross, while room exits will total 1 to 1.5 percent.

consolidated results the following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2017, 2016, and 2015. in accordance with gaap, our income statements include legacy-starwood's results of operations from the merger date. all references to the effect of legacy-starwood operations on our 2017 results refer to the incremental amounts contributed by legacy-starwood operations in 2017 over the effect of legacy-starwood operations on our results for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2016. all references to the effect of the starwood combination on our 2016 results refer to the amounts contributed by legacy-starwood operations from the merger date through december 31, 2016.
our 2017 results were favorably impacted by the non-recurring gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in avendra, discussed in footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions." we committed to the owners of the hotels in our system that the benefits derived from avendra, including any dividends or sale proceeds above our original investment, would be used for the benefit of the hotels in our system. accordingly, we intend to utilize the net proceeds for the benefit of our system of hotels and are currently developing those plans. spending under those plans will be expensed in our income statements and reduce our profitability in future periods.

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our loyalty programs, reservations, and marketing programs. as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income.
2017 compared to 2016
the $4,219 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue and reimbursed costs primarily reflected higher legacy-starwood reimbursements, loyalty program activity, and growth across our system.
2016 compared to 2015
the $1,916 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue and reimbursed costs primarily reflected $1,348 million from the starwood combination and the following legacy-marriott drivers: higher property occupancies, unit growth across our system, and growth in the marriott rewards program membership and activity.

2017 compared to 2016
depreciation, amortization, and other expenses increased by $122 million, primarily reflecting higher depreciation and amortization on legacy-starwood assets and $6 million higher write-offs of deferred contract acquisition costs.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $190 million, primarily due to the starwood combination, $14 million of higher litigation expenses, $13 million of higher development expenses, $10 million of higher compensation expenses, and $10 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
merger-related costs and charges decreased by $227 million. for more information, see footnote 4 "merger-related costs and charges."
2016 compared to 2015
depreciation, amortization, and other expenses increased by $29 million driven by $43 million from the starwood combination, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million from legacy-marriott operations which primarily reflected a favorable variance to 2015 impairment charges.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $70 million, primarily due to $79 million from the starwood combination, partially offset by a net decrease of $9 million in legacy-marriott expenses. the decrease primarily reflected $15 million in lower reserves for guarantee funding and $9 million in lower foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher administrative costs to grow our brands globally, $4 million of higher bad debt reserves, and $3 million net unfavorable impact to our legal expenses associated with 2015 litigation resolutions.
merger-related costs and charges increased by $386 million. for more information, see footnote 4 "merger-related costs and charges."

2017 compared to 2016
gains and other income, net increased by $683 million, primarily due to the disposition of our ownership interest in avendra and the gain on the sale of a north american full-service property in the 2017 second quarter. see the "dispositions" caption of footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information.
interest expense increased by $54 million, primarily due to an increase in debt as a result of the starwood combination and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $18 million of lower interest due to the maturities of series h and i notes and a $13 million favorable variance to the bridge term loan facility commitment costs that we incurred in 2016.
interest income increased by $3 million, primarily due to issuances of new loans, partially offset by $7 million lower interest income on a repaid loan.
equity in earnings increased by $29 million, primarily due to higher earnings by legacy-starwood investees.
2016 compared to 2015
gains and other income, net decreased by $22 million, primarily due to the net legacy-marriott gain that we recorded in 2015.
interest expense increased by $67 million, primarily due to a net increase in senior notes interest expense ($18 million), an increase in debt as a result of the starwood combination ($15 million), the amortization of costs for a bridge term loan facility commitment that we obtained in the 2016 first quarter ($13 million), net lower capitalized interest primarily due to the completion of the new york (madison square park) edition in 2015 ($9 million), and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings ($7 million).
interest income increased by $6 million, primarily driven by higher legacy-marriott interest income on a loan that we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a north american limited-service property in the 2015 fourth quarter ($8 million), partially offset by lower legacy-marriott interest income on two repaid loans ($6 million).
equity in earnings decreased by $6 million, primarily reflecting a net unfavorable variance to three legacy-marriott adjustments recorded in 2015, partially offset by $5 million from the starwood combination.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the 2017 tax act, which significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the 2017 tax act requires complex computations that were not previously required by u.s. tax law, significant judgments in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that differs from our interpretation. see footnote 7 "income taxes" for further information on the impact of the 2017 tax act on our 2017 results.
as discussed below and in footnote 7 "income taxes," our accounting for the 2017 tax act is not yet complete as we continue to refine our calculations, collect necessary information, and monitor developing interpretations. as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional regulatory or accounting guidance, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts we have recorded during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment of the 2017 tax act that could materially impact our provision for income taxes in the periods in which we make such adjustments. although we are not yet able to quantify all impacts of the 2017 tax act on our 2018 and future results, we believe that the overall impact of the 2017 tax act on our future financial results will be positive. we discuss the provisional impact on our 2017 results and the potential impact on our future results further in the paragraphs below.
33
reduction of u.s. federal corporate tax rate. the 2017 tax act reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective january 1, 2018. in 2017, we recorded a provisional estimated net tax benefit of $159 million from remeasurement of our year-end deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower rate at which we expect they will be realized in the future. while we have made a reasonable estimate of the impact of the corporate tax rate reduction, that estimate could change as we complete our analyses of all impacts of the 2017 tax act, including, but not limited to, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.
deemed repatriation transition tax. the deemed repatriation transition tax ("transition tax") is a new tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits ("e&p") of certain of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated post-1986 through year-end 2017. in addition to u.s. federal income taxes, deemed repatriation of such e&p under the 2017 tax act may result in additional state income taxes in some of the u.s. states in which we operate. we recorded a provisional estimated transition tax expense of $745 million in 2017. we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax, and our estimate could change when we finalize all necessary calculations.
we estimate that cash payments for the transition tax will total $600 million, which is lower than our provisional estimated transition tax expense due to our ability to utilize tax credits that we have carried over from prior years and other adjustments. the federal portion of the transition tax is payable over eight years, and we estimate that we will pay $578 million as follows: 8 percent in each of the years from 2018 to 2022, 15 percent in 2023, 20 percent in 2024, and 25 percent in 2025. our estimate includes payment of an additional $22 million in state income taxes in 2018 as a result of the 2017 tax act. these amounts could change when we finalize our analysis of the taxability of the e&p in the states in which we operate.
state net operating losses and valuation allowances. we must assess whether various aspects of the 2017 tax act affect our state net operating loss valuation allowances. as discussed above, we have recorded provisional estimates of state income taxes for certain portions of the 2017 tax act, but we have not completed our analysis for the states where we have net operating loss carryovers and valuation allowances. because we have not yet completed our determination of the need for, or any change in, any valuation allowance, we have not recorded any change to our valuation allowances as a result of the 2017 tax act.
other provisions. we continue to evaluate other provisions in the 2017 tax act, including: (1) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat"), a new minimum tax; (2) elimination of u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"); (4) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and (5) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the u.s. income tax liability. because we have not yet completed our analysis of these provisions, we do not have a reasonable estimate of their potential impact, if any, on our future results.
the impact of the 2017 tax act, and other changes affecting our provision for income taxes, are discussed below.

2017 compared to 2016
provision for income taxes increased by $1,060 million, primarily due to the 2017 tax act ($586 million), the gain on the sale of our interest in avendra ($259 million), higher earnings due to the inclusion of legacy-starwood operations for the full year 2017 ($244 million), lower merger-related costs ($86 million), an unfavorable comparison to the 2016 release of a valuation allowance ($15 million), the gain on the disposition of a north american full-service property ($9 million), and a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign jurisdictions ($7 million). the increase was partially offset by tax benefits from the adoption of asu 2016-09 ($72 million), tax law changes in non-u.s. jurisdictions ($22 million), change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings ($26 million), the reversal of tax reserves related to interest accrued for previous periods ($15 million), and adjustments resulting from finalizing prior years' returns ($10 million).
2016 compared to 2015
provision for income taxes increased by $8 million, driven by $4 million from the starwood combination and the following legacy-marriott drivers: tax rate changes in several jurisdictions ($12 million), higher earnings from foreign operations ($6 million), and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 u.s. and foreign true-ups ($5 million), partially offset by lower u.s. earnings due to merger-related expenses ($11 million) and the release of a valuation allowance ($8 million).

business segments the following discussion presents an analysis of the results of operations of our reportable business segments: north american full-service, north american limited-service, and asia pacific. in the 2017 first quarter, our asia pacific operating segment met the applicable accounting criteria to be a reportable segment. our europe, middle east and africa, and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments, and accordingly we have not included those operations in this discussion of our business segments. see footnote 18 "business segments" to our financial statements for other information about each segment, including revenues and a reconciliation of segment profits to net income.
our 2016 results in this section do not include any legacy-starwood results for the period between the merger date and the end of the 2016 third quarter, as we did not allocate any legacy-starwood results to our segments for the eight days ended september 30, 2016.

2017 compared to 2016
in 2017, across our north american full-service segment, we added 55 properties (13,056 rooms) and 12 properties (2,912 rooms) left our system.
north american full-service segment profits increased by $405 million, primarily due to the following:
•   $305 million of higher base management and franchise fees, primarily reflecting $297 million of higher legacy-starwood fees, $14 million from legacy-marriott unit growth, and $8 million of stronger revpar at legacy-marriott hotels, partially offset by $17 million of lower legacy-marriott residential branding fees;
•   $45 million of higher incentive management fees, primarily driven by $31 million of higher legacy-starwood fees and higher net house profits at legacy-marriott managed hotels;
•   $61 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting $63 million of higher legacy-starwood owned and leased profits;
•   $44 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expenses, primarily reflecting higher depreciation and amortization on legacy-starwood assets;
•   $22 million of higher gains and other income, net, primarily due to the gain on the sale of a north american full-service hotel in the 2017 second quarter; and
•   $16 million of higher equity in earnings, primarily due to higher earnings by legacy-starwood investees.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american full-service segment properties totaled $12,391 million in 2017, compared to $9,126 million in 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, across our north american full-service segment we added 424 properties (154,521 rooms), including 398 properties (147,623 rooms) from the starwood combination on the merger date, and two properties (213 rooms) left our system.
north american full-service segment profits increased by $216 million, reflecting $110 million from the starwood combination and $106 million of higher legacy-marriott profits, primarily due to the following:
•   $58 million of higher legacy-marriott base management and franchise fees, primarily reflecting $30 million of stronger revpar and unit growth and $21 million of higher branding fees;
•   $17 million of higher legacy-marriott incentive management fees, primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels;

•   $19 million of higher legacy-marriott owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting $10 million of favorable operating results at several properties and $6 million of lower pre-opening costs; and
•   $11 million of lower legacy-marriott general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to $6 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding and $5 million of lower administrative costs.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our legacy-marriott north american full-service segment properties totaled $8,161 million in 2016, compared to $7,911 million in 2015.

2017 compared to 2016
in 2017, across our north american limited-service segment we added 270 properties (33,128 rooms) and 26 properties (2,875 rooms) left our system.
north american limited-service segment profits increased by $118 million, primarily due to the following:
•   $118 million of higher base management and franchise fees, primarily reflecting $51 million of higher legacy-starwood fees, $42 million from legacy-marriott unit growth, $13 million of higher legacy-marriott relicensing fees, and $11 million of stronger revpar at legacy-marriott hotels;
•   $6 million of lower incentive management fees, primarily driven by softer performance and a change in the specified owner return at a legacy-marriott portfolio of managed hotels; and
•   $5 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher global design profits and higher legacy-marriott termination fees.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $3,004 million in 2017, compared to $2,688 million in 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, across our north american limited-service segment we added 451 properties (60,637 rooms), including 226 properties (34,294 rooms) from the starwood combination on the merger date, and 8 properties (880 rooms) left our system.
north american limited-service segment profits increased by $47 million, reflecting $9 million from the starwood combination and $38 million of higher legacy-marriott profits, primarily due to the following:
•   $14 million of higher legacy-marriott base management and franchise fees, primarily due to $50 million from new units and stronger revpar, partially offset by $24 million of lower relicensing fees and an $11 million decrease in deferred fee recognition;
•   $10 million of higher legacy-marriott incentive management fees, primarily driven by $10 million of higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios;
•   $4 million of higher legacy-marriott owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting higher net earnings at several leased and owned properties;
•   $5 million of lower legacy-marriott general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to $7 million of lower reserves for guarantee funding; and
•   $3 million of higher legacy-marriott gains and other income, net, primarily due to a favorable variance to the $4 million prior year disposal loss for a north american limited-service segment plot of land.

2017 compared to 2016
in 2017, across our asia pacific segment we added 77 properties (18,035 rooms) and 10 properties (3,961 rooms) left our system.
asia pacific segment profits increased by $169 million, primarily due to the following changes:
•   $109 million of higher base management and franchise fees, primarily due to $89 million of higher legacy-starwood fees, $9 million of higher legacy-marriott branding fees, $6 million from legacy-marriott unit growth, and $5 million from stronger revpar at legacy-marriott hotels;
•   $92 million of higher incentive management fees, primarily due to $80 million of higher legacy-starwood fees, $8 million from higher net house profits at legacy-marriott managed hotels, and $4 million from legacy-marriott unit growth;
•   $19 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily due to $22 million of higher legacy-starwood owned and leased profits;
•   $24 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expenses, primarily reflecting higher depreciation and amortization on legacy-starwood assets;
•   $34 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to the starwood combination; and

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our asia pacific segment properties totaled $695 million in 2017, compared to $404 million in 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
in 2016, across our asia pacific segment we added 377 properties (115,995 rooms), including 335 properties (103,611 rooms) from the starwood combination on the merger date, and 4 properties (1,342 rooms) left our system.
asia pacific segment profits increased by $78 million, reflecting $61 million from the starwood combination and $17 million of higher legacy-marriott profits, primarily due to the following:
•   $7 million of higher legacy-marriott base management and franchise fees, primarily due to $9 million of stronger revpar and unit growth and $2 million of higher branding fees, partially offset by the impact of $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates;
•   $8 million of higher legacy-marriott incentive management fees, primarily driven by $10 million in higher net house profits and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates;
•   $3 million of higher legacy-marriott owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, primarily reflecting stronger performance at a property following renovations and the impact of $2 million in favorable foreign exchange rates;
•   $4 million of higher legacy-marriott general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to an increase in administrative costs to grow our brands globally; and
•   $4 million of higher legacy-marriott equity in earnings, primarily reflecting a 2015 impairment charge on an asia pacific joint venture ($6 million).
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our legacy-marriott asia pacific segment properties totaled $320 million in 2016, compared to $274 million in 2015.

share-based compensation we award: (1) restricted stock units ("rsus") of our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights ("sars") for our common stock; (3) stock options to purchase our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. we also issue performance-based rsus ("psus") to named executive officers and some of their direct reports. see footnote 6 "share-based compensation" for more information.
new accounting standards see footnote 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and our credit facility we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") that provides for up to $4,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings to support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor (the london interbank offered rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. while any outstanding commercial paper borrowings and/or borrowings under our credit facility generally have short-term maturities, we classify the outstanding borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. the credit facility expires on june 10, 2021.
the credit facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), each as defined in the credit facility) to not more than 4 to 1. our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the credit facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.
we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.
we issue commercial paper in the u.s. we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility.
at year-end 2017, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $2,010 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,627 million under our credit facility and our cash balance of $383 million. we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $4,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting $2,373 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility).
we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs, primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper. since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility's covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.

investing activities cash flows acquisition of a business, net of cash acquired. cash outflows of $2,412 million in 2016 were due to the starwood combination. see footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information.
capital expenditures and other investments. we made capital expenditures of $240 million in 2017, $199 million in 2016, and $305 million in 2015. capital expenditures in 2017 increased by $41 million compared to 2016, primarily due to improvements to our worldwide systems and improvements to hotels acquired in the starwood combination. capital expenditures in 2016 decreased by $106 million compared to 2015, primarily due to lower spending for our edition hotels.
we expect 2018 investment spending will total approximately $600 million to $700 million, including approximately $225 million for maintenance capital spending. consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments.
over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. the ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. in the starwood combination, we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels, many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell. we also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include new construction, loans, guarantees, and noncontrolling equity investments.
fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.
dispositions. property and asset sales generated $1,418 million cash proceeds in 2017 and $218 million in 2016. see footnote 3 "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.
loan activity. from time to time, we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $94 million in 2017, compared to net collections of $35 million in 2016. at year-end 2017, we had $149 million of senior, mezzanine, and other loans outstanding, compared to $248 million outstanding at year-end 2016.

equity and cost method investments. cash outflows of $63 million in 2017, $14 million in 2016, and $7 million in 2015 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflect our investments in several joint ventures.
financing activities cash flows debt. debt decreased by $268 million in 2017, to $8,238 million at year-end 2017 from $8,506 million at year-end 2016, primarily due to $293 million in series i notes that matured in the 2017 second quarter, partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. see footnote 11 "long-term debt" for additional information on the debt issuances.
our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. at year-end 2017, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 2.9 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.0 years. the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2017.
see the "cash requirements and our credit facility," caption in this "liquidity and capital resources" section for more information on our credit facility.
share repurchases. we purchased 29.2 million shares of our common stock in 2017 at an average price of $103.66 per share, 8.0 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $71.55 per share, and 25.7 million shares in 2015 at an average price of $75.48 per share. at year-end 2017, 32.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under board approved authorizations. for additional information, see "fourth quarter 2017 issuer purchases of equity securities" in part ii, item 5.
dividends. our board of directors declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2017: (1) $0.30 per share declared on february 10, 2017 and paid march 31, 2017 to shareholders of record on february 24, 2017, (2) $0.33 per share declared on may 5, 2017 and paid june 30, 2017 to shareholders of record on may 19, 2017, (3) $0.33 per share declared on august 10, 2017 and paid september 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on august 24, 2017, and (4) $0.33 per share declared on november 9, 2017 and paid december 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on november 22, 2017. our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.33 per share on february 9, 2018, payable on march 30, 2018 to shareholders of record on february 23, 2018.

the preceding table does not reflect estimated transition tax payments totaling $600 million as a result of the 2017 tax act. in addition, the table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2017 of $448 million. see footnote 7 "income taxes" for additional information.
in addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.

in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the other joint venture owner.
for further information, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the "commitments" caption in footnote 8 "commitments and contingencies."
letters of credit at year-end 2017, we had $162 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the credit facility, as defined in footnote 11 "long-term debt"), most of which were for our self-insurance programs. surety bonds issued as of year-end 2017 totaled $155 million, most of which state governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.
related party transactions equity method investments we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management services and receive fees. we also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. in addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.
other related parties we provide management services for and receive fees from properties owned by jwm family enterprises, l.p., which is beneficially owned and controlled by j.w. marriott, jr., deborah marriott harrison, and other members of the marriott family.
for more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see footnote 19 "related party transactions."
critical accounting policies and estimates our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
while we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. actual results may differ significantly. additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
see footnote 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" for further information related our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:
loyalty programs, including how members earn points, how we estimate the value of future redemption obligation, and how we recognize revenue for these programs;
goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;
41
intangibles and long-lived assets, including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets;
investments, including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments;
loan loss reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types;
income taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well our provisional estimates of the current year impacts of the 2017 tax act; and business combinations, including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates, royalty rates, and the amount and timing of future cash flows.

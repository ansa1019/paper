accounting period our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest december 31. we report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. each of the fiscal years ended december 31, 2017 ("fiscal year 2017") and january 1, 2017 ("fiscal year 2016") included 52 weeks. the fiscal year ended january 3, 2016 ("fiscal year 2015") included 53 weeks. the additional week in fiscal year 2015 has been reflected in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. the fiscal year ending december 30, 2018 will include 52 weeks.
overview of fiscal year 2017
during fiscal year 2017, we continued to see good performance from acquisitions, investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. our overall revenue in fiscal year 2017 increased $141.5 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal year 2016, reflecting an increase of $65.5 million, or 4%, in our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue and an increase of $76.0 million, or 13%, in our diagnostics segment revenue. the increase in our discovery & analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $48.1 million from our laboratory services market revenue and an increase of $21.1 million from our environmental, food and industrial markets revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million from our life sciences research market revenue. the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by continued expansion in our newborn, maternal fetal health and infectious diseases screening solutions and applied genomics solutions.
in our discovery & analytical solutions segment, we experienced growth during fiscal year 2017 driven by successful new product introductions and an improving macro-environment. we also experienced strong demand for our laboratory service offerings as well as our environmental and food offerings. in the life sciences research market, we experienced continued decline in sales of radioactive reagents in our radio-nucleotide business.
in our diagnostics segment, we experienced growth from continued expansion in our newborn and infectious disease screening businesses, particularly in the emerging markets. we also experienced strong growth in our advanced genomics front-end sample preparation business in the americas. as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in a reduction of long-term health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets. during fiscal year 2017, we expanded both the extent and reach of our capabilities to enable earlier treatments and better outcomes, both in terms of diseases and geographies. the acquisition of euroimmun has increased our reagent mix, expanded our technical capabilities and positioned us in more attractive markets.
our consolidated gross margins decreased 36 basis points in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in product mix partially offset by benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain. our consolidated operating margin increased 12 basis points in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development.
we continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. overall, we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets, coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth.

consolidated results of continuing operations revenue
2017 compared to 2016. revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $2,257.0 million, as compared to $2,115.5 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $141.5 million, or 7%, which includes an approximate 2% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures and a 0.4% increase in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. the total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our diagnostics segment revenue of $76.0 million, or 13%, due to continued expansion in our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions and strong growth in applied genomics. our new acquisitions, euroimmun and tulip, contributed $13.5 million and $38.5 million, respectively, in revenues during fiscal year 2017. our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue increased by $65.5 million, or 4%, due to an increase of $48.1 million from our laboratory services market revenue and an increase of $21.1 million from our environmental, food and industrial markets revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million from our life sciences research market revenue. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.7 million of revenue primarily related to our diagnostics segment for each of the fiscal years 2017 and 2016 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.
2016 compared to 2015. revenue for fiscal year 2016 was $2,115.5 million, as compared to $2,104.8 million for fiscal year 2015, an increase of $10.7 million, or 1%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates with minimal impact from acquisitions and divestitures. in addition, our fiscal year 2015 had an additional week, which consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to fiscal year 2016, which consisted of 52 weeks. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. the total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our diagnostics segment revenue of $26.1 million, or 5%, due to continued expansion in our newborn screening, blood banking and screening businesses. our discovery & analytical solutions segment revenue decreased by $15.4 million, or 1%, due to a decrease in environmental, food and industrial markets revenue of $20.8 million and life sciences research market revenue of $0.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in laboratory services market revenue of $6.0 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.7 million of revenue primarily related to our diagnostics segment for fiscal year 2016 and $0.8 million for fiscal year 2015 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

2016 compared to 2015. selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2016 were $600.9 million, as compared to $587.2 million for fiscal year 2015, an increase of approximately $13.7 million, or 2%. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 28.4% in fiscal year 2016, compared to 27.9% in fiscal year 2015. amortization of intangible assets increased and was $40.7 million for fiscal year 2016, as compared to $33.8 million for fiscal year 2015. the mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss of $14.9 million for fiscal year 2016, as compared to a loss of $11.1 million for fiscal year 2015. stock-based compensation expense decreased and was $15.2 million for fiscal year 2016, as compared to $15.5 million for fiscal year 2015. during fiscal year 2015, we recorded $0.8 million in legal costs for a particular case. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $17.5 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $0.7 million for fiscal year 2015. in addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to growth investments, which was partially offset by the result of lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives.
research and development expenses
2017 compared to 2016. research and development expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $139.4 million, as compared to $124.3 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $15.1 million, or 12%. as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses increased to 6.2% in fiscal year 2017, as compared to 5.9% in fiscal year 2016. amortization of intangible assets was $0.3 million in fiscal year 2017, as compared to $0.5 million in fiscal year 2016. the mark-to-market adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was an income of $0.1 million for fiscal year 2017. stock-based compensation expense increased and was $1.4 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to $0.9 million for fiscal year 2016. in addition to the above items, the increase in research and development expenses was largely the result of investments in new product development, primarily from our investments in vanadis focused on non-invasive prenatal screening. this was partially offset by lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives. we directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, primarily towards the diagnostics, environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. we have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs.

we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations, with terms varying in length, through fiscal year 2022.
we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. we recorded additional pre-tax charges of $3.6 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million in the discovery & analytical solutions segment during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.5 million during fiscal year 2017, in the diagnostics segment as a result of these contract terminations.

2017 compared to 2016. interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2017 was an expense of $8.1 million, as compared to an expense of $39.0 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $30.9 million. the decrease in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was largely due to a decrease in other expense, net by $37.3 million which consisted primarily of net foreign exchange gain related to remeasurement and settlement of the acquisition-related hedges of $36.5 million and an increase in interest income of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. interest income increased primarily due to interest income derived from investing the proceeds from the sale of our medical imaging business in money market mutual funds, until these proceeds were redeemed by end of fiscal year 2017 to partially fund the euroimmun purchase price consideration. this was partially offset by a net loss on disposition of businesses and assets of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to a net gain of $5.6 million in fiscal year 2016 and an increase in interest expense of $2.4 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 due to the impact of four quarters of interest expense on our 2026 notes in fiscal year 2017 as compared to two quarters of interest expense in fiscal year 2016 as the 2026 notes were issued in july 2016. a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
2016 compared to 2015. interest and other expense, net, for fiscal year 2016 was an expense of $39.0 million, as compared to an expense of $42.1 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $3.1 million. the decrease in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a gain on disposition of businesses and assets, net recognized in fiscal year 2016 which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $3.5 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 due to the issuance of the new higher interest rate 2026 notes, which replaced our lower cost debt outstanding on our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility. other expenses for fiscal year 2016 decreased by $1.1 million as compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 47.1%, 11.6% and 9.6% for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates. a reconciliation of income tax expense at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, predominantly singapore, finland, netherlands and china, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, resulting in a benefit from income taxes of $55.9 million in fiscal year 2017, $48.2 million in fiscal year 2016 and $36.1 million in fiscal year 2015. these amounts include $10.1 million in fiscal year 2017, $11.4 million in fiscal year 2016 and $8.3 million in fiscal year 2015 of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore. the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017 was $0.09 and $0.09, respectively, for fiscal year 2016 was $0.10 and $0.10, respectively, and for fiscal year 2015 was $0.07 and $0.07, respectively. the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in china expired in 2017 and the tax holiday in one other subsidiary in china is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2019. the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2018.
on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law tax reform legislation, known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. internal revenue code, which includes reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
we have performed a preliminary analysis of the impacts of the tax act based on currently available information and recorded a discrete tax expense of $106.5 million during fiscal year 2017, which was comprised of $21.5 million from the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate income tax rate and $85.0 million from the one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, internal revenue service and treasury department guidance that may be issued and actions we may take. the effects of the tax act provisions are still being evaluated by management, and there could be additional effects of the tax act which could have material positive or negative impacts on our current or future tax position.
disposition of businesses and assets as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements, we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity ("asu 2014-08"), continues to be reported as a discontinued operation, and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017 and january 1, 2017.
in august 1999, we sold the assets of our technical service business. we recorded pre-tax gains (losses) of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2016 and $(0.03) million in fiscal year 2015 for a contingency related to this business. these gains (losses) were recognized as a gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes.
during fiscal year 2016, we entered into a letter of intent to contribute certain assets to an academic institution in the united kingdom. we recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.6 million related to the write-off of assets in the second quarter of 2016 which is included in interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
during fiscal year 2016, we sold perkinelmer labs, inc. for cash consideration of $20.0 million, recognizing a pre-tax gain of $7.1 million. the sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of $7.3 million, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.5 million that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016. during fiscal year 2017, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $1.1 million relating to the earn-out consideration received from the buyer. perkinelmer labs, inc. was a component of our diagnostics segment. the pre-tax gain recognized in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 is included in interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations. the divestiture of perkinelmer labs, inc. has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10-k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements.
during fiscal year 2017, we sold suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co., ltd. for aggregate consideration of $2.3 million, recognizing a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million. the pre-tax loss recognized in fiscal year 2017 is included in interest and other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations. suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co., ltd. was a component of our diagnostics segment. the divestiture of suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co., ltd. has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10-k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements.

on may 1, 2017 (the "closing date"), we completed the sale of our medical imaging business to varex imaging corporation ("varex") pursuant to the terms of the master purchase and sale agreement, dated december 21, 2016 (the "agreement"), by and between us and varian medical systems, inc. ("varian") and the subsequent assignment and assumption agreement, dated january 27, 2017, between varian and varex, pursuant to which varian assigned its rights under the agreement to varex. on the closing date, we received consideration of approximately $277.4 million for the sale of the medical imaging business. during fiscal year 2017, we paid varex $4.2 million to settle a post-closing working capital adjustment. during fiscal year 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $179.6 million and income tax expense of $43.1 million related to the sale of the medical imaging business in discontinued operations and dispositions. the corresponding tax liability was recorded within the other tax liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and we expect to utilize tax attributes to minimize the tax liability.
following the closing, we are providing certain customary transitional services during a period of up to 12 months. commercial transactions between the parties following the closing of the transaction are not expected to be significant.
we presented our medical imaging business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 2016 and 2015. the results of discontinued operations during fiscal year 2017 include the results of the medical imaging business through april 30, 2017.

business combinations acquisitions in fiscal year 2017
acquisition of euroimmun medizinische labordiagnostika ag. during fiscal year 2017, we completed the acquisition of 99.98% of the outstanding stock of euroimmun medizinische labordiagnostika ag ("euroimmun") for aggregate consideration of €1.2 billion. the purchase price was funded by borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured term loan credit facility of $710.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, and available cash on hand of $503.8 million. euroimmun is based in lübeck, germany, has approximately 2,400 employees, and is recognized as a global leader in autoimmune testing and an emerging force in infectious disease and allergy testing. euroimmun's technologies and platforms are expected to fill gaps in our existing product lines, broaden our offerings and drive synergies, and also expand our geographic reach. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. as a result of the acquisition, we recorded goodwill of $614.8 million, which is not tax deductible, and intangible assets of $897.4 million. we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our diagnostics segment from the acquisition date. identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 16.1 years.
other acquisitions in 2017. during the fiscal year 2017, we completed the acquisition of two other businesses for aggregate consideration of $142.1 million. the acquired businesses were tulip diagnostics private limited ("tulip"), which was acquired for total consideration of $127.3 million in cash and one other business acquired for total consideration of $14.8 million in cash. we have a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of tulip up to inr1.6 billion in additional consideration over a two year period, which is currently equivalent to $25.2 million, and is accounted for as compensation expense in our financial statements over a two year period and is excluded from the purchase price allocation shown below. the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforces acquired, and has been
36
allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. we reported the operations of tulip within the results of our diagnostics segment and the other acquired business within the results of our discovery & analytical solutions segment from the acquisition date. identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 11.8 years.
euroimmun's revenue and net loss for the period from the acquisition date to december 31, 2017 were $13.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. the following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined financial results for the company and euroimmun as if the acquisition of euroimmun had been completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2016:

the unaudited pro forma information for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and the impact of acquisition date fair value adjustments. the fiscal year 2017 unaudited pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to exclude approximately $9.8 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. the fiscal year 2016 pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to include these acquisition-related transaction costs and the nonrecurring expenses related to the fair value adjustments. these pro forma condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as fair value adjustment to inventory, increased interest expense on debt obtained to finance the transaction, and increased amortization for the fair value of acquired intangible assets.
the pro forma information does not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the acquisition. the pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities.
acquisitions in fiscal year 2016
during fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of two businesses for total consideration of $72.3 million in cash. the acquired businesses were bioo scientific corporation, which was acquired for total consideration of $63.5 million in cash and one other business acquired for total consideration of $8.8 million in cash. the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforces acquired. as a result of the acquisitions, we recorded goodwill of $43.1 million, which is not tax deductible, and intangible assets of $22.1 million. we have reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery & analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates. identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 9.4 years.
acquisitions in fiscal year 2015
during fiscal year 2015, we completed the acquisition of five businesses for total consideration of $77.1 million in cash. the acquired businesses included vanadis diagnostics ab ("vanadis"), which was acquired for total consideration of $35.1 million in cash, and other acquisitions for aggregate consideration of $42.0 million in cash. at the time of closing, we had a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to $93.0 million, with an estimated fair value of $56.9 million. the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, of which $9.2 million is tax deductible. we have reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery & analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates.
37
we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, with the exception of the euroimmun acquisition, to be material to our consolidated results of operations; therefore, we are only presenting pro forma financial information of operations for the euroimmun acquisition. the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions, with the exception of euroimmun, completed during fiscal year 2017 for the period from their acquisition dates to december 31, 2017 was $38.5 million and the results of operations were not material. the aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to december 31, 2017 and january 1, 2017 were minimal. we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.
as of december 31, 2017, the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were final. the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2017 were based upon initial valuations. our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates. the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. during the measurement periods, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. with our adoption of accounting standards update no. 2015-16, simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments ("asu no. 2015-16") during 2015, these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings.
during fiscal year 2017, we obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, related to recent acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations. based on this information, for the bioo acquisition, we recognized an increase in intangible assets of $2.2 million, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million, a decrease in current assets of $0.1 million, and a decrease in goodwill of $2.6 million, and for the tulip acquisition, we recognized an increase in property and equipment of $1.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill.
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.
as of december 31, 2017, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $83.0 million. as of december 31, 2017, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $65.3 million, of which $52.2 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $13.1 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. as of january 1, 2017, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $63.2 million, of which $15.4 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $47.8 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 1.75 years from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at december 31, 2017 was 11 months. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions. the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on
38
the historical direct costs related to providing the services. we do not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. in most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. the sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.
contingencies, including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party ("prp") for certain waste disposal sites. we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. we have accrued $9.4 million and $9.9 million as of december 31, 2017 and january 1, 2017, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which represents our management's estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. for sites where we have been named a prp, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. there have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.
various tax years after 2010 remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as finland, germany, italy, netherlands, singapore, the united kingdom and the united states. the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management's judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.
we are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 31, 2017 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. however, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.
reporting segment results of continuing operations discovery & analytical solutions
2017 compared to 2016. revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $1,578.5 million, as compared to $1,513.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $65.5 million, or 4%, which includes an approximate 0.3% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures and 0.3% increase in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. the increase in revenue in our discovery & analytical solutions segment was a result of an increase of $48.1 million from our laboratory services market revenue and an increase of $21.1 million from our environmental, food and industrial markets revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million from our life sciences research market revenue. in our laboratory services market, we continued to experience increased demand for our onesource laboratory service business as our onesource team continued to drive growth with an expansion of services to existing customers coupled with a number of significant new customers wins. in our environmental, food and industrial markets, we experienced higher growth in our food and inorganic product offerings as a result of increased government regulation of soil and water and increased focus on food safety laws and mandatory testing, particularly in emerging markets such as china, as well as in the americas. in our life sciences market, we experienced a continued decline in sales of radioactive reagents in our radio-nucleotide business.
39
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 was $206.7 million, as compared to $196.8 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $9.9 million, or 5%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $50.7 million for fiscal year 2017 as compared to $53.3 million for fiscal year 2016. restructuring and contract termination charges, net increased and were $10.4 million for fiscal year 2017 as compared to $4.7 million for fiscal year 2016. acquisition and divestiture-related costs, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $0.4 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to $0.6 million for fiscal year 2016. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2016. legal costs for a particular case was $2.7 million for fiscal year 2017. in addition to the factors noted above, operating income increased for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, as we continued to see the benefits from our cost containment initiatives partially offset by higher costs in research and development expenses and a shift in product mix, with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings.
2016 compared to 2015. revenue for fiscal year 2016 was $1,513.0 million, as compared to $1,528.4 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $15.4 million, or 1%, which includes an approximate 1.0% decrease in revenue attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates with minimal impact from acquisitions and divestitures. in addition, fiscal year 2016 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to fiscal year 2015 which consisted of 53 weeks. the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by product type for fiscal year 2016, as compared to fiscal year 2015, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. the decrease in revenue in our discovery & analytical solutions segment was a result of a decrease in environmental, food and industrial revenue of $20.8 million and a decrease in life sciences market revenue of $0.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in laboratory services market revenue of $6.0 million. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $27 thousand of revenue in our discovery & analytical solutions segment for fiscal year 2015 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. in our environmental, food and industrial markets, revenue decreased due to weak harvest conditions. in our life sciences research market, we experienced decreases in revenue from our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding. in our laboratory services market, we had increased demand for our onesource service offerings. our onesource laboratory service business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers.
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2016 was $196.8 million, as compared to $162.8 million for fiscal year 2015, an increase of $34.1 million, or 21%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $53.3 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $54.6 million for fiscal year 2015. restructuring and contract termination charges, net decreased and were $4.7 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $11.4 million for fiscal year 2015. acquisition and divestiture-related costs, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $0.6 million for fiscal year 2016, as compared to $0.4 million for fiscal year 2015. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2016 as compared to $7.3 million in fiscal year 2015. in addition to the factors noted above, increased operating income for fiscal year 2016, was primarily due to favorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales in higher gross margin product offerings, early benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain, and lower costs related to cost containment initiatives partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development and unfavorable impacts from foreign currency.
diagnostics
2017 compared to 2016. revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $678.5 million, as compared to $602.5 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $76.0 million, or 13%, which includes an approximate 6% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures and 0.5% increase in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.7 million of revenue primarily related to our diagnostics segment for each of the fiscal years 2017 and 2016 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. in our diagnostics market, we experienced growth from continued expansion of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states, particularly in emerging markets such as china and india, and strong growth in applied genomics. euroimmun and tulip contributed $13.5 million and $38.5 million, respectively, in revenues during fiscal year 2017.
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 was flat as compared to fiscal year 2016. amortization of intangible assets increased and was $23.0 million for fiscal year 2017 as compared to $18.1 million for fiscal year 2016. restructuring and contract termination charges, net increased and were $2.2 million for fiscal year 2017 as compared to $0.4 million for fiscal year 2016. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $29.4 million in fiscal year 2017, as compared to an incremental expense of $17.7 million for fiscal year 2016. the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an

incremental expense of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2017. excluding the impact of the above items, operating income increased during fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to strong reproductive health sales and benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain.
2016 compared to 2015. revenue for fiscal year 2016 was $602.5 million, as compared to $576.4 million for fiscal year 2015, an increase of $26.1 million or 5%, which includes an approximate 1% decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates, and an approximate 2% decrease in revenue attributable to the impact of prior year acquisitions and divestitures. in addition, fiscal year 2016 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to fiscal year 2015 which consisted of 53 weeks. as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.7 million of revenue for fiscal year 2016 and $0.8 million for fiscal year 2015 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. in our diagnostics market, we experienced growth from continued expansion of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states, particularly in emerging markets such as china, as well as in europe. birth rates in the united states continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the united states is also increasing, as evidenced by prenatal trends we saw during fiscal year 2016.
operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2016 was $149.6 million, as compared to $146.5 million for fiscal year 2015, an increase of $3.1 million, or 2%. amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $18.1 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $22.0 million for fiscal year 2015. restructuring and contract termination charges, net decreased and were $0.4 million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $2.1 million for fiscal year 2015. acquisition and divestiture-related expenses and other costs added an incremental expense of $17.7 million in fiscal year 2016, as compared to decreasing expenses by $1.1 million for fiscal year 2015. in addition to the factors noted above, increased operating income for fiscal year 2016, as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to pricing initiatives and lower costs as a result of cost containment initiatives and benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain, which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development.
.
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. however, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:
•   changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and
•   changes in our working capital requirements.
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:
•   financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,
•   increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,
•   a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,
•   increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,
•   a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and
•   volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

financing lease obligations. in fiscal year 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. at the end of the construction period, we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. as a result, we capitalized $29.3 million in property, plant and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. we have also capitalized $11.5 million in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. at december 31, 2017, we had $35.9 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $1.4 million was recorded as short-term debt and $34.5 million was recorded as long-term debt. at january 1, 2017, we had $37.1 million recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which $1.2 million was recorded as short-term debt and $35.9 million was recorded as long-term debt. the buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. at the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.
dividends our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. at december 31, 2017, we had accrued $7.7 million for a dividend declared on october 27, 2017 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 that was paid in february 2018. on january 25, 2018, we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 that will be payable in may 2018. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

(3)   the 2026 notes include interest obligations. as of december 31, 2017, the 2026 notes had a carrying value of $591.7 million.
(4)   the other debt facilities include interest obligations. as of december 31, 2017, the other debt facilities had a carrying value of $60.2 million.
(5)   the financing lease obligations do not include interest obligations.
(6)   employee benefit payments only include obligations through fiscal year 2027.
(7)   we have excluded $1.7 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from our uncertain tax positions, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.
as of december 31, 2017, we may have to pay the shareholders of our acquisition contingent consideration of up to $83.0 million. the table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain. for further information related to our contingent consideration obligations, see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
capital expenditures during fiscal year 2018, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2017, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.
other potential liquidity considerations at december 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $202.1 million, of which $187.5 million was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, and we had $363.6 million of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we had no other liquid investments at december 31, 2017.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. as a result of the sale of our medical imaging business, we sold assets and liabilities of certain foreign operations, liquidated a related foreign entity and repatriated approximately $63.6 million of previously unremitted earnings. we provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of these earnings and recorded a tax expense of $4.2 million in discontinued operations and dispositions for fiscal year 2017. we expect to utilize tax attributes to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation.
46
the tax act, among other items, requires us to pay a one-time tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2017, the amount of foreign earnings that we have invested outside the u.s. was approximately $1.4 billion. based on available information, we estimated the tax on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings and have recorded a tax expense of $85.0 million in continuing operations. this estimated discrete tax provision incorporates assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the tax act, and may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance becomes available during 2018.
on july 27, 2016, our board authorized us to repurchase up to 8.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "repurchase program"). the repurchase program will expire on july 26, 2018 unless terminated earlier by our board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. during fiscal year 2017, we had no stock repurchases under the repurchase program. as of december 31, 2017, 8.0 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program.
in addition, our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. during fiscal year 2017, we repurchased 78,644 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $4.4 million. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 75,198 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $3.6 million. during fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 95,129 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $4.4 million.
the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. if we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. in difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.
our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. with respect to plans outside of the united states, we expect to contribute $8.8 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2018. in january 2018, we made a voluntary contribution of $15.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for plan year 2017. during fiscal year 2017, we contributed $8.4 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the united states. during fiscal year 2016, we made contributions of $9.6 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the united states. during fiscal year 2015, we contributed $14.9 million, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the united states and $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states. we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1 - nature of operations and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
47
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition. we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. for products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. for revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met. certain of our products require specialized installation. revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.
in limited circumstances, we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, including cord blood processing and storage. for these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe are available. tpe is the price of our or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.
revenue from software licenses and services was 4% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2017, and 5% for each of fiscal years 2016 and 2015. we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. for the undelivered elements, we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the stated renewal rate method. we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements on a stand-alone basis.
we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.
the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.
warranty costs. we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period.
allowances for doubtful accounts. we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. this would reduce our earnings. accounts are written-off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted.
inventory valuation. we value inventory at the lower of cost or market. inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method. we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic
48
levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. this would reduce our earnings. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
business combinations. business combinations are accounted for at fair value. acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development ("ipr&d") is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.
value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. we undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. the goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 2, 2017 and january 4, 2016, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. at january 2, 2017, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit, except for our informatics reporting unit. at january 2, 2017 and january 1, 2018, our informatics reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $217.2 million at december 31, 2017, had a fair value that was less than 20% but greater than 10% more than its carrying value. informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry. despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit, we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge. while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.
non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized. in addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our non-amortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite, the asset will be tested for impairment. this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization.
employee compensation and benefits. we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and
49
administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.
we recognized a gain of $10.4 million in fiscal year 2017, a loss of $14.5 million in fiscal year 2016 and a loss of $9.4 million in fiscal year 2015 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which includes the charge or benefit for the mark-to-market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the loss or income related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pre-tax gain of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2017, a pre-tax loss of $15.3 million in fiscal year 2016 and pre-tax loss of $12.4 million in fiscal year 2015. we expect income of approximately $5.7 million in fiscal year 2018 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2018. mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2018. conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2018. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee's approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. beginning in fiscal year 2016, the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain non-u.s. benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. prior to fiscal year 2016, we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. beginning in fiscal year 2016, we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.
as of december 31, 2017, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 7.25% and to be 6.00% for all plans outside the united states. in addition, as of december 31, 2017, we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 3.56% and to be 1.99% for all plans outside the united states. for the plans in the united states, we adopted the updated projection scale, mp-2015, that was published by the society of actuaries in 2015, as of january 3, 2016. the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a $6.8 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation as of january 3, 2016. during fiscal year 2016, the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale, mp-2016, which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation. we adopted mp-2016, as of january 1, 2017. the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a $5.5 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 1, 2017. during fiscal year 2017, the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale, mp-2017, which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligations. we adopted mp-2017 as of december 31, 2017. the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a $2.6 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2017. we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans' historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets. our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date.

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 31, 2017, our pension plan expenses would also change.

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.
restructuring activities. our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) impairment of assets as discussed above under "value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles." because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. for example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. in addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. when such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled "restructuring and contract termination charges, net."
dispositions. when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. this estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. any such changes decrease or increase current earnings. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017, net pre-tax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations was $179.6 million.
income taxes. our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision. any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.
the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. internal revenue code, which includes reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. we have performed a preliminary analysis of the impacts of the tax act using information available at this time and recorded the discrete tax expense in continuing operations. the impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, internal revenue service and treasury department guidance that may be issued and actions we may take. the

effects of tax act provisions are still being evaluated by management, and there could be additional effects of the tax act which could have material positive or negative impacts on our current or future tax position.
we will be subject to the new global intangible low tax income ("gilti") tax rules that are part of the modified territorial tax system imposed by the tax act. because of the complexity of the new rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740. under u.s. gaap, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes (the "deferred method"). our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. because whether we expect to have future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends not only on our current structure and estimated future results of global operations, but also on our intent and ability to modify our structure and/or our business, we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the tax act. therefore, we have not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti.
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.
additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards, state income tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign tax attributes. valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. in projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision.
we plan to keep our unremitted foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the u.s. without an associated net tax cost, such as withholding or state and local taxes. our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our u.s. and non-u.s. operations. as of december 31, 2017, the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the u.s. indefinitely and for which no incremental u.s. tax cost has been provided, other than the $85.0 million from the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation, was approximately $1.4 billion. it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such incremental tax costs on those earnings.

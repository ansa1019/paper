cautionary note concerning forward-looking statements certain statements in this annual report on form 10-k constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies, integration of acquired businesses, new service offerings, financial prospects, anticipated sources and uses of capital and our proposed acquisition of scripps networks. words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. the following is a list of some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: changes in the distribution and viewing of television programming, including the expanded deployment of personal video recorders, subscription video on demand ("svod"), internet protocol television, mobile personal devices and personal tablets and their impact on television advertising revenue; continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios; a failure to secure affiliate agreements or renewal of such agreements on less favorable terms; rapid technological changes; the inability of advertisers or affiliates to remit payment to us in a timely manner or at all; general economic and business conditions; industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, feature film, television and television commercial production; spending on domestic and foreign television advertising; disagreements with our distributors or other business partners over contract interpretation; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and political unrest and regulatory changes in international markets, from events including brexit; market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries; the regulatory and competitive environment of the industries in which we, and the entities in which we have interests, operate; uncertainties inherent in the development of new business lines and business strategies; uncertainties regarding the financial performance of our equity method investees; our ability to complete, integrate and obtain the anticipated benefits and synergies from our proposed business combinations and acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of scripps networks, on a timely basis or at all; uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and provision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies; future financial performance, including availability, terms, and deployment of capital; the ability of suppliers and vendors to deliver products, equipment, software, and services; our ability to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost-reduction initiative; the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation; availability of qualified personnel; the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union; changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the federal communications commission and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings; changes in income taxes due to regulatory changes, such as u.s. tax reform, or changes in our corporate structure; changes in the nature of key strategic relationships with partners, distributors and equity method investee partners; competitor responses to our products and services and the products and services of the entities in which we have interests; threatened terrorist attacks and military action; our significant level of debt; reduced access to capital markets or significant increases in costs to borrow; and a reduction of advertising revenue associated with unexpected reductions in the number of subscribers. these risks have the potential to impact the recoverability of the assets recorded on our balance sheets, including goodwill or other intangibles. for additional risk factors, refer to item 1a, "risk factors." these forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other factors speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-tv, fta and broadcast television, authenticated applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel, our most widely distributed global brand, tlc, animal planet, id, velocity (known as turbo outside of the u.s.) and eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-tv programmer across europe and asia. we also develop and sell curriculum-based education products and services and operate production studios.
37
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales, and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dth satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, lifestyle, general entertainment, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television network brands, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television network brands. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.

39
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase for our u.s. networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines. international networks' increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
other revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the vten joint venture during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 9%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our international networks segment, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. content amortization was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and ten acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the scripps networks acquisition and integration costs of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of advance/newhouse's preferred stock. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of goodwill goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $17 million. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss (gain) on disposition the change in loss (gain) on disposition was $67 million. we recorded a $4 million loss for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the sale of the raw and betty production studios on april 28, 2017, compared with a gain of $63 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the gain on disposition recorded for the year ended december 31, 2016 is comprised of the $50 million gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business seeker and sourcefed studios in connection with the group nine transaction and the $13 million gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the nordics. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased $122 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on september 21, 2017 for the financing of the anticipated scripps networks acquisition. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
40
loss on extinguishment of debt on march 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $173 million primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, partially offset by increases in earnings at own and decreases in losses at all3media. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

other expense increased $114 million in 2017. we recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016, mostly due to exchange rate changes on the u.s. dollar compared with the british pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets. increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of $98 million on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes, which were settled on september 21, 2017. the interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation. the losses were partially offset by various other items, including a gain of $17 million on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on september 21, 2017. (see note 9 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own. we recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

income tax expense was $176 million and $453 million and our effective tax rate was (128)% and 27% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2017, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of non-cash goodwill impairment charges that are non-deductible for tax purposes. thereafter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments, and to a lesser extent, the domestic production activity deduction benefit, the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, and the impact of the 2017 tax act (see note 16 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements). the benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017. in 2016, we favorably resolved multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017.
42
segment results of operations - 2017 vs. 2016
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. additionally, beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2017, adjusted oibda also excludes material incremental third-party transaction costs directly related to the scripps networks acquisition and planned integration. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and scripps networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. as of january 1, 2017, the company no longer excludes amortization of deferred launch incentives in calculating total adjusted oibda as this expense is not material. for the year ended december 31, 2016, deferred launch incentives of $13 million were not reflected as an adjustment to the calculation of total adjusted oibda in order to conform to the current presentation.
adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net (loss) income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenues distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. distribution revenues increased 5%. excluding the impact of the own acquisition, distribution revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue due to the timing of content deliveries. these increases were partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. total portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period.
advertising revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of the own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, advertising revenue increased 2% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to pricing

increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines.
other revenue increased 30% primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the vten joint venture during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. excluding the impact of own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenue increased 1%. content amortization was $752 million and $716 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4%. excluding the impact of own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2017. increased spending on viewer research was offset by decreases in personnel and marketing costs.

revenues distribution revenue increased 11%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia.
advertising revenue increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by increases in volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
other revenue remained consistent with the prior year.

the impairment of goodwill presented above for corporate and inter-segment eliminations is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the european reporting unit during 2017. the remaining portion of the impairment of $489 million is a component of our international networks segment. the presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the company's ceo. goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within corporate and inter-segment eliminations.
the decrease in mark-to-market share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in discovery's stock price in 2017 compared to 2016. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2017 and 2016, the company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below. the company also has various acquisitions and dispositions that impact the comparability of our results. to the extent that the transaction materially impacts a particular item or segment, it may be discussed in the relevant section above (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements).
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-fx"), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2016 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. distribution revenue increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 7% at our u.s. networks segment and 9% at our international networks segment. u.s. networks distribution revenue increased primarily due to contractual rate increases partially offset by slight declines in subscribers. international networks' distribution revenue increases were mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue decreased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 2% as a result of increases of 2% at our u.s. networks and 3% at our international networks. the increase for our u.s. networks was due to inventory management and pricing increases, partially offset by a decline in ratings. the increase for our international networks was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in central and eastern europe, the middle east, and africa ("ceemea"), partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe.
other revenue decreased 2%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue, which includes revenues from services provided to equity investees, increased 3%. this was due to increases at our u.s. networks offset by decreases at our international networks.

costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015 and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for content on our networks, particularly sports rights and associated production costs, and increases in content impairments in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies. content amortization was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was due to increases in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense from increases in the company's stock price and marketing expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization declined slightly for the year ended december 31, 2016 as there were slight declines in capital spending and no new significant business combinations.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions in the second quarter of 2016. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) this increase was partially offset by decreases in content impairments that were classified as other charges.
(gain) loss on disposition gain on disposition increased $80 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of a gain recorded upon the deconsolidation of our digital networks businesses seeker and sourcefed studios on december 2, 2016 in connection with the group nine media transaction, and the recognition of a gain following the resolution of the final contingent payment for the sale of the radio business, compared with an expected loss in the prior year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the march 11, 2016 issuance of the 4.90% senior notes due march 2026. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
(loss) income from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $39 million due to investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy and increased losses at all3media for derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

other income (expense), net increased $101 million in 2016. the change is primarily the result of gains in foreign currency offset by a $62 million other-than-temporary impairment in the value of our lionsgate shares (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). the change in foreign currency (gains) losses, net is caused by the remeasurement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2016, exchange rate changes in the british pound resulted in net remeasurement gains. the gains in the current year are in contrast to losses in the prior period for the remeasurement of our 1.90% euro-dominated senior notes due march 19, 2027, which have been effectively hedged for the year ended december 31, 2016 , and remeasurement losses on monetary assets in venezuela following a steep decline in value during the prior year.

income tax expense was $453 million and $511 million and the effective tax rate was 27% and 33% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the net 6% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the resolution of multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, the impact of various foreign legislative changes, and tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments. the decrease was partially offset by 2015 favorable audit resolutions which positively impacted the assessment of uncertain tax positions for 2015 but did not recur in 2016. (see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

revenues distribution revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america. such growth is consistent with the value negotiated in new arrangements following investment in sports content in markets in europe and the continued development of the pay-tv markets in latin america.
advertising revenue decreased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and, to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in ceemea, partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe and lower price, ratings and volume in asia.
other revenue decreased 22%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue decreased 17% due to a reduction in sublicensing revenue for eurosport.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 6%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 11%. the increase was mostly attributable to increased spending on content, particularly sports rights and associated production costs, and increases in content impairments, primarily in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies. content amortization was $976 million and $906 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
adjusted oibda remained consistent with the prior period.
the increase in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in discovery's stock price in 2016 compared to 2015. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time, certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2016 and 2015, the company has identified foreign currency and the impact of the acquisition of eurosport as items impacting comparability between periods, as noted below.
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-fx), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful
55
information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2015 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2015 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. we maintain an effective registration statement on form s-3 that allows us to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.

•   debt debt incurred for the scripps networks acquisition in august and september 2017, the company entered into $2 billion of term loan credit facilities and issued $6.8 billion of senior notes to fund a portion of the scripps networks acquisition. on september 21, 2017, dcl, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, issued $5.9 billion in senior fixed rate notes, $400 million in senior floating rate notes (together, the "2017 usd notes") and £400 million principal amount of 2.500% fixed rate senior notes (the "sterling notes"), collectively the "2017 senior notes." using exchange rates as of december 31, 2017, the senior notes had a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.9% without including the impact of debt issuance costs. the proceeds received by dcl from the 2017 senior notes were net of a $11 million issuance discount and $57 million of debt issuance costs. the 2017 senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company. some of these proceeds have been invested in short-term investments until the closing of the acquisition. approximately $5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes is subject to repayment by the company to satisfy provisions related to the special mandatory redemption provision attached to certain series of the 2017 senior notes. the special mandatory redemption provision requires the company to redeem the applicable senior notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable senior notes, following a termination of the scripps networks merger agreement or if the merger does not close prior to august 30, 2018. the $5.9 billion principal amount of senior notes subject to the special mandatory redemption provision will be classified as noncurrent until either of the contingent events which would trigger the redemption has occurred. as of december 31, 2017, neither of the contingent events have occurred and therefore these senior notes are classified as noncurrent.
on august 11, 2017, dcl, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, entered into a three-year delayed draw tranche and a five-year delayed draw tranche unsecured term loan credit facility (the "term loans"), each with a principal amount of up to $1 billion. the term of each delayed draw loan begins when discovery borrows the funds to finance a portion of the purchase price of the scripps networks acquisition. the term loans' interest rates are based, at the company's option, on either adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin. the company will pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points per annum for each loan, based on its current credit rating, beginning september 28, 2017 until either the funding of the term loans or the termination of the scripps networks acquisition. as of december 31, 2017, the company has not yet borrowed on the term loan credit facilities.
issuance of debt to fund the tender offer for outstanding senior notes on march 13, 2017, dcl issued $450 million principal amount of 3.80% senior notes due march 13, 2024 (the "march 2017 usd notes") and an additional $200 million principal amount of its existing 4.90% senior notes due march 11, 2026 (the "2016 usd notes"). the company used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that also closed on march 13, 2017.
all of dcl's outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by discovery and contain certain covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.
revolving credit facility we also have access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, as amended on august 11, 2017 (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $425 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.69%. the revolving credit facility agreement provides for a maturity date of august 11, 2022, and the option for two additional 364-day renewal periods. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery. borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, which mirror the provisions of the credit agreement governing the term loans, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. dcl, its subsidiaries and discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. the credit agreement, as amended on august 11, 2017, continues to require dcl to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3.00 to 1.00 and now requires a consolidated leverage ratio of financial covenant of 5.50 to 1.00, with step-downs to 5.00 to 1.00 in the first year after the closing and 4.50 to 1.00 in the second year after the closing. as of december 31, 2017, discovery, dcl and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
57
commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1.0 billion. the maturities of these notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit ratings assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2017, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. borrowings under the commercial paper program would reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.
we repay our senior notes, term loans, revolving credit facility and commercial paper as required, and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash.
•   cash settlement of common stock repurchase contract we elected to settle our outstanding prepaid common stock repurchase contract in cash during the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, resulting in the receipt of $58 million. the cash received was inclusive of a $1 million premium over the $57 million up-front cash payment made in 2016 and was determined by the market price of our series c common stock during the settlement period in march 2017. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   dispositions on february 26, 2018, we announced the planned sale of a controlling equity stake in its education business in the first half of 2018 to francisco partners for cash of $120 million. no loss is expected upon sale. the company will retain an equity interest. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   real estate strategy and relocation of global headquarters on january 9, 2018, we announced a new real estate strategy with plans to relocate the company's global headquarters from silver spring, maryland to new york city, new york in 2019. contingent upon the closing of our acquisition of scripps networks, we will establish a national operation headquarters at scripps networks' current campus in knoxville, tennessee. the sale and closure of our silver spring building is expected approximately one year from the closing of the scripps networks transaction.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and funding for various investments.
•   investments and business combinations scripps networks acquisition on february 26, 2018, the u.s. department of justice notified the company that it has closed its investigation into discovery's agreement for a plan of merger to acquire scripps networks in a cash-and-stock transaction. the estimated merger consideration for the acquisition totals $12.0 billion, including cash of $8.4 billion and stock of $3.6 billion based on the series c common stock price as of january 31, 2018. in addition, the company will assume scripps networks' net debt of approximately $2.7 billion in aggregate principal amount. the transaction is expected to close by early 2018.
scripps networks shareholders will receive $63.00 per share in cash and a number of shares of discovery's series c common stock that is determined in accordance with a formula and subject to a collar based on the volume weighted average price of the company's series c common stock. the formula is based on the volume weighted average price of discovery's series c common stock over the 15 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to closing (the "average discovery price"). scripps networks shareholders will receive 1.2096 shares of discovery's series c common stock if the average discovery price is below $22.32, and 0.9408 shares of discovery's series c common stock if the average discovery price is above $28.70. the intent of the range was to provide scripps networks shareholders with $27.00 of value per share in discovery series c common stock; if the average discovery price is greater than or equal to $22.32 but less than or equal to $28.70, scripps networks shareholders will receive a proportional number of shares between 1.2096 and 0.9408. if the average discovery price is below $25.51, discovery has the option to pay additional cash instead of issuing more shares above the 1.0584 conversation ratio required at $25.51. the cash payment is equal to the product of the additional shares required under the collar formula multiplied by the average discovery price; for example, if the average discovery price were $22.32 with a conversion ratio of 1.2096, the company could offer shares at the 1.0584 ratio and pay for the difference associated with the incremental
58
shares in cash. outstanding employee equity awards or share-based awards that vest upon the change of control will be acquired with a similar combination of cash and shares of discovery series c common stock pursuant to terms specified in the merger agreement. therefore, the merger consideration will fluctuate based upon changes in the share price of discovery series c common stock and the number of scripps networks common shares, stock options, and other equity-based awards outstanding on the closing date. discovery will also pay certain transaction costs incurred by scripps networks. the post-closing impact of the formula was intended to result in scripps networks' shareholders owning approximately 20% of discovery's fully diluted common shares and discovery's shareholders owning approximately 80%. the company will utilize previously issued debt proceeds (see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) and cash on hand to finance the cash portion of the transaction. the transaction is subject to approvals and other customary closing conditions.
on july 30, 2017, the company obtained a commitment letter from a financial institution for a $9.6 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could have been used to complete the scripps networks acquisition. no amounts were drawn under the bridge loan commitment and the commitment was terminated on september 21, 2017, following the execution of the term loans and the issuance of the 2017 senior notes. the company incurred $40 million of debt issuance costs related to the bridge loan commitment.
during 2017, the company issued $6.8 billion in senior notes to fund the anticipated scripps networks acquisition (see note 3 and note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) of these total proceeds, $2.7 billion were invested in money market funds, $1.3 billion were invested in time deposit accounts, and the remainder was invested in highly liquid, short-term instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. these investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and are anticipated to be used for the scripps networks acquisition. in the interim, the company has full access to these proceeds.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred transaction and integration costs for the scripps networks acquisition of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of advance/newhouse's preferred stock. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we expect to continue to incur transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of scripps networks in 2018.
•   other investments and business combinations our uses of cash have included investment in equity method investments, afs securities, cost method investments (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and business combinations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company invested $322 million in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. the company has $20 million of future funding commitments for these investments as of december 31, 2017 and intends to reduce its investments starting in 2018. we provide funding to our equity method investees from time to time. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company acquired other equity method investments, largely to enhance the company's digital distribution strategies and made additional contributions to existing equity method investments totaling $73 million.
on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own increasing discovery's ownership stake from 49.50% to 73.99%. discovery paid $70 million in cash and recognized a gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the previously held 49.50% equity interest. the gain is included in other (expense) income, net in the company's consolidated statements of operations. (see note 3 and note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
our cost method investments as of december 31, 2017 primarily include a 42% minority interest in group nine media with a carrying value of $212 million. the company also has investments in an educational website and an electric car racing series. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $413 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k.

•   common stock repurchase program under the company's stock repurchase program, management was authorized to purchase shares of the company's common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors. as of december 31, 2017, the company had repurchased 3 million and 164 million shares of series a and series c common stock over the life of the program for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $6.6 billion, respectively. the company's authorization under the program expired on october 8, 2017, and we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since then. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in the future, we may also choose to fund stock repurchases through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions.
•   preferred stock conversion and repurchase prior to the exchange agreement with advance/newhouse entered into on july 30, 2017, we had an agreement with advance/newhouse to repurchase, on a quarterly basis, a number of shares of series c-1 convertible preferred stock convertible into series c common stock purchased under the company's stock repurchase program during the then most recently completed fiscal quarter. the price paid per share was calculated as 99% of the average price paid for the series c common shares repurchased by the company during the applicable fiscal quarter multiplied by the series c conversion rate. the advance/newhouse repurchases are made outside of the company's publicly announced stock repurchase program. the advance/newhouse repurchase agreement was amended on august 7, 2017 to conform the terms of the previous agreement, as detailed above, to the conversion ratio of the newly issued series c-1 convertible preferred stock. prior to the exchange agreement, we converted and retired 2.3 million shares of our series c convertible preferred stock under the preferred stock conversion and repurchase arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $120 million. following the exchange agreement, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of series c-1 convertible preferred stock for a purchase price of $102 million. the aggregate purchase price paid during the year ended december 31, 2017, including series c convertible preferred stock and series c-1 convertible preferred stock, was $222 million. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we made cash payments of $274 million and $357 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   restructuring and other our uses of cash include restructuring costs related to management changes and cost reduction efforts, including employee terminations, intended to enable us to more efficiently operate in a leaner and more directed cost structure and invest in growth initiatives, including digital services and content creation. as of december 31, 2017, we have restructuring liabilities of $42 million related to employee terminations. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). we expect to incur additional restructuring costs following the acquisition of scripps networks in early 2018.
•   share-based compensation we expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled share-based awards. actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations, which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding. during 2017, we paid $1 million for cash-settled share-based awards. as of december 31, 2017, liabilities totaled $47 million for outstanding liability-classified share-based compensation awards, of which $12 million was classified as current. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   repurchase of debt dcl used the proceeds from the offerings of the march 2017 usd notes and the 2016 usd notes to repurchase $600 million aggregate principal amount of dcl's 5.05% senior notes due 2020 and 5.625% senior notes due 2019 in a cash tender offer.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $249 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to a $253 million decrease in cash paid for taxes. the decrease in cash paid for taxes, net, for the year ended december 31, 2017 is mostly due to the tax impact from the company's investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. (see note 4 and note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) declines in working capital, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables.
cash provided by operating activities increased $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. improvements in operating results were partially offset by increases in content spending, particularly for sports rights, of $131 million and the impact of foreign currency.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased $377 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of $172 million, including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of $98 million that did not receive hedge accounting, but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued september 21, 2017.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $45 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $80 million, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of businesses of $42 million.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased $7.1 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which will be used to finance the scripps networks acquisition (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in repurchases of stock of $771 million, offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $265 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was attributable to an increase in repurchases of stock of $423 million and a decrease in net borrowings of $471 million, which is comprised of increases in repayments under our revolving credit facility, net of repayments, of $973 million partially offset by increased borrowings of senior notes, net of repayments, of $411 million and decreases in commercial paper repayments of $91 million. these net increases were partially offset by decreases in purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $548 million and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of interest rate contracts of $69 million.

(a) interest on our senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. our senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2017 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2019 and 2047.
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months, including any potential required payments related to the special mandatory redemption provision associated with certain senior notes issued on september 21, 2017. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2017, we held $103 million of our $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. the 2017 tax act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay foreign taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

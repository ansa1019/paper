our 2017 financial results were as follows:
•   sales of $2.3 billion increased 8%, reflecting a 6% increase in organic sales (excluding acquisitions and divestitures) and a 2% increase due to acquisitions/divestitures.
•   operating income of $502.6 million was up 22% and operating margin of 22.0% was up 250 basis points, respectively, from the prior year.
•   net income increased 24% to $337.3 million.
•   diluted eps of $4.36 increased $0.83, or 24%, compared to 2016.
our 2017 financial results, adjusted for $8.5 million of restructuring expense and a $9.3 million gain on sale of a business, compared to our 2016 financial results, adjusted for $3.7 million of restructuring expense, a $3.6 million pension settlement charge and a $22.3 million loss on the sale of businesses - net, were as follows (these non-gaap measures have been reconciled to u.s. gaap measures in item 6, "selected financial data"):
•   adjusted operating income of $501.7 million was up 14% and adjusted operating margin of 21.9% was up 120 basis points, respectively, from the prior year.
17
•   adjusted net income increased 16% to $333.7 million.
•   adjusted eps of $4.31 was 15% higher than prior year adjusted eps of $3.75.
based on continued order strength in the fourth quarter, as well as benefits from our growth initiatives and segmentation efforts, we project approximately 5% organic revenue growth in 2018. full year 2018 eps is expected to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10.
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2017. for purposes of this item, reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses. management's primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin.
in the following discussion, and throughout this report, references to organic sales, a non-gaap measure, refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states but excludes (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture. the portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. the company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. the company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
performance in 2017 compared with 2016
(in thousands)                  2017                    2016          change net sales             $2,287,312              $2,113,043             8     %
operating income         502,556                 412,397            22     %
operating margin            22.0   %                19.5   %       250         bps sales in 2017 were $2.3 billion, an 8% increase from last year. this increase reflects a 6% increase in organic sales and a 2% increase from acquisitions/divestitures (acquisitions: thinxxs - december 2017; sfc koenig - september 2016; awg fittings - july 2016 and akron brass - march 2016 / divestitures: faure herman - october 2017; cvi korea - december 2016; ietg - october 2016; cvi japan - september 2016 and hydra-stop - july 2016). sales to customers outside the u.s. represented approximately 49% of total sales in 2017 compared with 50% in 2016.
in 2017, fluid & metering technologies contributed 38% of sales and 42% of operating income; health & science technologies contributed 36% of sales and 32% of operating income; and fire & safety/diversified products contributed 26% of sales and 26% of operating income.
gross profit of $1.0 billion in 2017 increased $95.9 million, or 10%, from 2016, while gross margin increased 90 basis points to 44.9% in 2017 from 44.0% in 2016. the increase in gross profit and margin is primarily a result of increased sales volume and the dilutive impact in the prior year attributable to $14.7 million of fair value inventory step-up charges from 2016 acquisitions.
sg&a expenses increased to $524.9 million in 2017 from $492.4 million in 2016. the $32.5 million increase is mainly attributable to $15.2 million of net incremental impact from acquisitions and divestitures as well as higher variable compensation and stock compensation expense. as a percentage of sales, sg&a expenses were 23.0% for 2017 and 23.3% for 2016.
in 2017, the company divested its faure herman business for a pre-tax gain of $9.3 million. in 2016, the company divested four businesses during the year (hydra-stop - july 2016; cvi japan - september 2016; ietg - october 2016; and cvi korea - december 2016) for a pre-tax loss-net of $22.3 million.
18
in 2017 and 2016, the company incurred pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $8.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization.
operating income of $502.6 million in 2017 increased from $412.4 million in 2016, primarily due to a gain on a divestiture in 2017 compared to a net loss on four divestitures in 2016, higher sales volume and the $14.7 million of fair value inventory step- up charges from 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by higher restructuring costs in 2017 and overall higher sg&a costs in 2017 due to higher variable and share-based compensation as well as outside consulting costs. operating margin of 22.0% in 2017 was up 250 basis points from 19.5% in 2016 primarily due to the gain on the sale of a business in 2017 compared to a net loss on the sale of businesses in 2016, the dilutive impact in the prior year due to $14.7 million of fair value inventory step-up charges from 2016 acquisitions, as well as higher volume and productivity initiatives.
other (income) expense - net changed by $4.1 million, from income of $1.7 million in 2016 to expense of $2.4 million in 2017 mainly due to a $4.7 million foreign exchange gain on intercompany loans in the prior year that did not repeat in 2017 due to the fact that the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the earnings impact associated with these intercompany loans.
interest expense decreased to $44.9 million in 2017 from $45.6 million in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to slightly lower borrowings in 2017 compared with 2016.
the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. the provision for income taxes increased to $118.0 million in 2017 compared to $97.4 million in 2016. the effective tax rate decreased to 25.9% in 2017 compared to 26.4% in 2016 due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"), a change in the permanent reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign subsidiaries as well as the incurrence of certain foreign income withholding taxes in the prior year. these amounts were offset by the prior year tax benefits on the divestitures of cvi korea and cvi japan, certain return-to-provision adjustments, a partial change in the assertion of permanent reinvestment of certain foreign earnings, as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.
on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax act. the tax act included significant changes to the existing tax law, including, but not limited to, a permanent reduction to the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, and the creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deferred foreign income ("transition tax"). we have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the tax act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded a net $0.1 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. although the net effect from the tax act was a $0.1 million tax benefit, there were several offsetting adjustments, including: a $40.6 million provisional tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; $30.3 million of provisional tax expense related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings based on cumulative foreign earnings of $779.0 million; and an additional $10.2 million of tax expense primarily related to the removal of the permanent reinvestment representation with respect to certain of its subsidiaries in canada, italy, and germany.
the tax act also establishes new provisions that will affect the company's 2018 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate on domestic operations from 35 percent to 21 percent; a tax on certain income from foreign operations (global intangible low-tax income, or "gilti"); a general elimination of u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation.
on december 22, 2017, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act ("sab 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the tax act. sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740. in accordance with sab 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete. to the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements. if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provision of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act. while the company is able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final impact of the tax act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in the company's interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by either the internal revenue service or the u.s. department of treasury, and actions the company may take. sab 118 provides up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and the company anticipates finalizing its accounting during 2018. the company has determined the following items are provisional amounts and reasonable estimates as of december 31, 2017: $40.6 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred
19
tax assets and liabilities, $30.3 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and $9.2 million of deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the removal of the permanent reinvestment representation with respect to certain of its subsidiaries in canada, italy and germany.
net income for the year of $337.3 million increased from $271.1 million in 2016. diluted earnings per share in 2017 of $4.36 increased $0.83 from $3.53 in 2016.

sales within our scientific fluidics & optics platform increased compared to 2016 due to strong demand in all primary end markets, including analytical instrumentation, in-vitro diagnostics and biotechnology, dna sequencing and semiconductor, partially offset by the impact of the cvi japan and cvi korea divestitures in 2016. sales within our material processing technologies platform were relatively flat compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of strategic changes in product focus which resulted in discontinued products, offset by global strength in the food and pharma end markets and a strong project funnel. sales within our sealing solutions platform increased significantly compared to 2016 due to the full year impact of the sfc koenig acquisition in 2016 as well as strength in the semiconductor market and an uptick in the oil and gas, mining and automotive markets. sales in our gast platform remained relatively flat year over year primarily due to the impact of oem headwinds during the first half of 2017 offset by increasing demand in industrial and dental markets. sales within our micropump platform increased year over year due to solid demand in the north american industrial markets.
20
operating income and operating margin of $179.6 million and 21.9%, respectively, in 2017 were up from $153.7 million and 20.6%, respectively, in 2016, primarily due to higher volume and the dilutive impact of the inventory step-up charge related to the sfc koenig acquisition in the prior year, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses in 2017, costs associated with site consolidations within the material processing technologies and the scientific fluidics & optics platforms as well as additional engineering investments and operational challenges as a result of the strong growth within the segment.

sales within our dispensing platform decreased slightly compared to 2016 due to declining markets in latin america and u.s. retail, partially offset by growing strength in europe and asia. sales increased in our band-it platform compared to the prior year as a result of rebounding energy markets as well as strength across the transportation and industrial markets and increasing demand in asia and latin america. sales within our fire & safety platform increased significantly compared to 2016 primarily due to the full year impact of the prior year acquisitions as well as strength in municipal and north american oem markets.
operating income of $147.0 million and operating margin of 25.0% were higher than the $123.6 million and 23.8%, respectively, in 2016, primarily due to higher volume and productivity, as well as the full year impact of the akron brass and awg fittings acquisitions on 2017 financial results and the inclusion of $7.5 million of fair value inventory step-up charges related to the acquisitions in the prior year period.

in 2016, fluid & metering technologies contributed 40% of sales and 44% of operating income; health & science technologies contributed 35% of sales and 31% of operating income; and fire & safety/diversified products contributed 25% of sales and 25% of operating income.
gross profit of $930.8 million in 2016 increased $26.5 million, or 3%, from 2015, while gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 44.0% in 2016 from 44.8% in 2015. the increase in gross profit is primarily a result of increased sales volume as a result of acquisitions, while the margin decrease is mainly attributable to $14.7 million of fair value inventory step-up charges from 2016 acquisitions compared to $3.4 million from 2015 acquisitions.
sg&a expenses increased to $492.4 million in 2016 from $474.2 million in 2015. the $18.2 million increase is mainly attributable to $41.4 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions, partially offset by current year divestitures and cost savings from prior year restructuring actions. as a percentage of sales, sg&a expenses were 23.3% for 2016 and 23.5% for 2015.

during 2016, the company recorded a $22.3 million pre-tax loss on the sale of businesses related to the four divestitures during the year (hydra-stop - july 2016; cvi japan - september 2016; ietg - october 2016; and cvi korea - december 2016), compared to the $18.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a business in 2015 (ismatec - july 2015).
during 2016, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $3.7 million as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. in 2015, the company recorded $11.2 million of restructuring expenses mainly attributable to employee severance from headcount reductions across all three segments and corporate.
operating income of $412.4 million in 2016 decreased from $437.0 million in 2015, primarily as a result of the impact of the four divestitures in 2016 and the associated loss compared to the one divestiture in 2015 and the associated gain as well as the incremental fair value inventory step-up charges related to the 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of $4.7 million of contingent consideration related to a 2015 acquisition and lower restructuring costs recorded in 2016 compared to 2015. operating margin of 19.5% in 2016 was down 210 basis points from 21.6% in 2015 primarily due to the loss on the sale of businesses in 2016 compared to a gain on the sale of a business in 2015, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower restructuring costs year over year.
other (income) expense - net changed by $4.7 million from expense of $3.0 million in 2015 to income of $1.7 million in 2016 mainly due to $4.7 million of foreign currency transaction gains on intercompany loans that were established in conjunction with the sfc koenig acquisition.
interest expense increased to $45.6 million in 2016 from $41.6 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to the $200 million series of senior notes issued in 2016 and higher borrowings outstanding on the revolving facility.
the provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. the provision for income taxes decreased to $97.4 million in 2016 compared to $109.5 million in 2015. the effective tax rate decreased to 26.4% in 2016 compared to 27.9% in 2015, due to tax benefits on the divestitures of cvi korea and cvi japan, certain return-to-provision adjustments and the early adoption of asu 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized as a reduction to income tax expense. these adjustments were offset by the incurrence of additional foreign withholding taxes, the prior year revaluation of the italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the italian statutory tax rate and tax expense on the divestiture of the hydra-stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the ismatec product line as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.
net income for the year of $271.1 million decreased from the $282.8 million in 2015. diluted earnings per share in 2016 of $3.53 decreased $0.09 from $3.62 in 2015.

sales within our energy platform increased compared to 2015 primarily due to strength within the aviation market, partially offset by continued weakness in the propane and oil and gas markets as well as challenges in the mobile end market. sales within our pumps platform (formerly industrial) decreased compared to 2015 due to weakness in the north american industrial distribution market. sales within the water platform decreased due to the divestitures of hydra-stop and ietg and slowing demand in the chemical end market, partially offset by increased municipal spending. sales within our agriculture platform increased year over year due to increased demand in the second half of 2016 from both oems and distributors in anticipation of the 2017 planting season. sales within the valves platform, which was created in the third quarter of 2015, increased as a result of the full year impact of the alfa valvole acquisition, offset by a challenging oil & gas market and overall weakness in the european market.
22
operating income and operating margin of $217.5 million and 25.6%, respectively, were higher than the $206.4 million and 24.0%, respectively, recorded in 2015, primarily due to the full year impact of the alfa valvole acquisition as well as productivity initiatives, partially offset by lower volume.

sales within our scientific fluidics & optics platform were down year over year due to slowed demand in the industrial and laser optics end markets as well as the impact of the cvi japan and cvi korea divestitures in 2016 and the ismatec divestiture in 2015 partially offset by strong demand in the core biotech and in-vitro diagnostic markets coupled with the full year impact of the cidra precision services acquisition and a strong semiconductor market. sales within our material processing technologies platform decreased compared to 2015 due to challenges in the north american markets which offset strength in the european and indian pharma markets. sales within our sealing solutions platform increased compared to 2015 due to the full year impact of the novotema acquisition in 2015, the 2016 acquisition of sfc koenig and continued strength in the semiconductor markets, partially offset by pressure in the oil & gas market. sales in our gast and micropump platforms decreased year over year due to continued softness in the north american industrial distribution markets.
operating income and operating margin of $153.7 million and 20.6%, respectively, in 2016 were down from $158.4 million and 21.4%, respectively, in 2015, primarily due to the inventory step-up charges related to the sfc koenig acquisition, the incremental impact of divestitures, partially offset by volume increases.

sales within our dispensing platform increased year over year due to a strong asian market and the overall strength of the x-smart product sales, partially offset by the foreign currency impact caused by the strength of the u.s. dollar and challenges within the european markets. sales decreased in our band-it platform compared to 2015 as a result of declines in the oil & gas market, offset by strength in the transportation industry and the rebound of the european and asian markets. sales within our fire & safety platform increased compared to 2015 primarily due to the akron brass and awg fittings acquisitions as well as increased sales due to new product development, partially offset by project delays in asia and large projects in europe in 2015 which did not reoccur.
operating income of $123.6 million was higher than the $117.3 million in 2015, while operating margin of 23.8% was lower than the 27.7% in 2015, primarily due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins and the inventory step-up charges related to the akron brass and awg fittings acquisitions. the higher operating income is primarily related to the impact of 2016 acquisitions.

liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased $32.8 million, or 8.2%, to $432.8 million in 2017, primarily due to higher earnings in 2017. at december 31, 2017, working capital was $643.1 million and the company's current ratio was 2.78 to 1. at december 31, 2017, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $376.0 million, of which $219.6 million was held outside of the united states.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased $454.5 million to $54.7 million in 2017, primarily as a result of $471.8 million less cash paid for acquisitions, $17.3 million of lower proceeds from the sale of businesses, and $6.0 million of higher proceeds from fixed asset disposals, partially offset by $5.6 million of higher capital expenditures.
cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $43.9 million and $38.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity, although a portion was for business system technology, replacement of equipment, and construction of new facilities. management believes that the company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.
the company acquired thinxxs in december 2017 for cash consideration of $38.2 million and the assumption of $1.2 million in debt. the purchase price for this acquisition was funded with cash on hand. the company acquired akron brass in march 2016 for cash consideration of $221.4 million; awg fittings in july 2016 for cash consideration of $47.5 million (€42.8 million); and sfc koenig in september 2016 for cash consideration of $241.1 million (€215.9 million). the purchase prices for the 2016 acquisitions were funded with both cash on hand and borrowings under the company's revolving facilities.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities changed from $46.5 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2016 to $277.4 million of cash used in financing activities in 2017, primarily as a result of higher payments under revolving facilities (net of borrowings) and proceeds from the issuance of $200.0 million senior notes, partially offset by a reduction of $28.2 million of purchases of common stock in 2017 and $7.3 million of lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
on june 13, 2016, the company completed a private placement of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.20% senior notes due june 13, 2023 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.37% senior notes due june 13, 2025 (collectively, the "notes") pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated june 13, 2016 (the "purchase agreement"). each series of notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 13th and december 13th. the notes are unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the company's other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. the company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the notes; provided that such portion is greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding. in the event of a prepayment, the company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. in addition, the company may repurchase the notes by making an offer to all holders of the notes, subject to certain conditions.
the company maintains a revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility"), which is a $700.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on june 23, 2020. at december 31, 2017, there was $10.7 million outstanding under the revolving facility and $7.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility at december 31, 2017 of $682.1 million. borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. this applicable margin is based on the company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from .005% to 1.50%. based on the company's credit rating at december 31, 2017, the applicable margin was 1.10%. given the fact that libor was negative at december 31, 2017, the default interest rate is equal to the applicable margin, resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 1.10% at december 31, 2017. interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of libor rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. the company may request increases in the lending commitments under the credit agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed $350.0 million. an annual revolving facility fee, also based on the company's credit rating, is currently 15 basis points and is payable quarterly.
on june 9, 2015, the company paid the balance of the 2.58% senior euro notes, upon its maturity, using cash on hand.
on december 9, 2011, the company completed a public offering of $350.0 million 4.2% senior notes due december 15, 2021 ("4.2% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of $346.2 million, after deducting a $0.9 million issuance discount, a $2.3 million underwriting commission and $0.6 million of offering expenses, were used to repay $306.0 million of outstanding
24
bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. the 4.2% senior notes bear interest at a rate of 4.2% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 15 and december 15. the company may redeem all or part of the 4.2% senior notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the note indenture governing the 4.2% senior notes. the company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the indenture. the indenture and 4.2% senior notes contain covenants that limit the company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the company's assets. the terms of the 4.2% senior notes also require the company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.2% senior notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
on december 6, 2010, the company completed a public offering of $300.0 million 4.5% senior notes due december 15, 2020 ("4.5% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering of $295.7 million, after deducting a $1.6 million issuance discount, a $1.9 million underwriting commission and $0.8 million of offering expenses, were used to repay $250.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. the 4.5% senior notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each june 15 and december 15. the company may redeem all or a portion of the 4.5% senior notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the note indenture governing the 4.5% senior notes. the company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the indenture. the indenture and 4.5% senior notes contain covenants that limit the company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the company's assets. the terms of the 4.5% senior notes also require the company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.5% senior notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
there are two key financial covenants that the company is required to maintain in connection with the revolving facility and the notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. at december 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the company's interest coverage ratio was 13.64 to 1 and the leverage ratio was 1.45 to 1. there are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% senior notes or 4.2% senior notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.
on december 1, 2015 the company's board of directors approved an increase of $300.0 million in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the revolving facility. during 2017, the company purchased a total of 0.3 million shares at a cost of $29.1 million compared to 0.7 million shares purchased in 2016 at a cost of $55.0 million. as of december 31, 2017, there was $551 million of repurchase authorization remaining.
the company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the revolving facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the company's common stock for the next twelve months. additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. as of december 31, 2017, $10.7 million was outstanding under the revolving facility, with $7.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility at december 31, 2017 of approximately $682.1 million.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business. there are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31, 2017, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. additional detail regarding these obligations is provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

critical accounting policies we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. for product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. in such cases, the company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with asc 605-25, revenue recognition-multiple-element arrangements, and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
the company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. the company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the company.
goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations. an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. additionally, testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually. on october 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. the amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets. in 2017 and 2016, the company concluded that certain long-lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in zero and $0.2 million of long-lived asset impairment charges, respectively.
26
the company's business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the company will incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in asc 350, goodwill and other intangible assets, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. to determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations.
the key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value. various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted ebitda, and terminal growth rates. the 2017 and 2016 ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the company are as follows:
assumptions                                  2017            2016
range           range weighted average cost of capital   8.75% to 10.5%   9.0% to 12.0%
market multiples                   11.0x to 20.0x   9.5x to 17.5x terminal growth rates                3.0% to 3.5%    3.0% to 3.5%
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the company considers both the market approach and the income approach. under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month ebitda and the forward looking 2018 ebitda (50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. the market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted ebitda and selected market multiples. under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.
the banjo trade name and the akron brass trade name are indefinite-lived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with asc 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of these trade names. the relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.
in 2017 and 2016, there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date.
defined benefit retirement plans - the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets. plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company. key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results could be adversely affected.
the society of actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables, which update life expectancy assumptions. idex adopts these annual updates and, in consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of december 31, 2017, which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years. new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans. these expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations.
changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the (gain) loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation ("pbo"), which in turn, may impact the company's funding decisions if the pbo exceeds plan assets. each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the pbo of approximately $29 million based upon the december 31, 2017 data. each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the pbo of approximately $35 million based upon the december 31, 2017 data.

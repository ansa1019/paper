sources of revenue match group's revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time. revenue is also derived from à la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.
angi homeservices revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which includes fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees paid by service professionals. consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of match (such as instant booking, instant connect, same day service or next day service) and geographic location of service. effective with the combination (described below), revenue is also derived from angie's list sales of time-based advertising to service professionals and membership subscription fees from consumers.
a substantial portion of the revenue from our applications and publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with google inc. ("google"). the company's services agreement became effective on april 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. the services agreement expires on march 31, 2020; however, the company may choose to terminate the agreement effective march 31, 2019. the services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google, and google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. any such updates could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from google was $740.7 million, $824.4 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from google represents 83%, 87% and 94% of applications revenue and 71%, 73% and 83% of publishing revenue, respectively.
the revenue earned by our video segment is derived from subscriptions, media production and distribution, and advertising.
the princeton review's revenue was primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services. shoebuy's revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales. pricerunner's revenue was derived principally from advertising.
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising a meaningful portion of the company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with google described above. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from google represents 22%, 26% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to apple and google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and payments made to partners who distribute our partnerships customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites such as facebook. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
we market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.

on march 31, 2017, match group sold its non-dating business, consisting of the princeton review. the non-dating business does not meet the threshold to be reflected as a discontinued operation at the iac level. the company moved the non-dating business to its "other" segment effective march 31, 2017 and prior period segment data has been recast to conform to this presentation.
2017 consolidated results in 2017, the company's revenue increased $167.4 million, or 5%, operating income increased $221.1 million from a loss of $32.6 million in the prior year and adjusted ebitda grew $74.1 million, or 15%. revenue increased due primarily to an increase of $237.5 million from angi homeservices due, in part, to the combination, growth of $212.6 million from match group and $48.3 million from video, partially offset by a decline of $259.4 million from other due to the sales of shoebuy, the princeton review and pricerunner on december 30, 2016, march 31, 2017 and march 18, 2016, respectively, and a decline of $45.5 million from publishing primarily due to the effects of the google contract. the operating income increase was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in adjusted ebitda, described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due, in part, to the combination. the goodwill impairment charge at publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. the adjusted ebitda increase was due primarily to growth of $65.6 million from match group, a profit from publishing of $31.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $7.6 million in 2016 and growth of $4.5 million from applications, partially offset by increased losses of $14.5 million from corporate, $9.2 million from video and a decline of $8.0 million from angi homeservices due primarily to costs of $44.1 million (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million related to the combination.

(i)   the sale of askfm on june 30, 2016 (reflected in the publishing segment)

(iv)   restructuring charges in 2016 of $15.6 million and $2.6 million at the publishing and applications segments, respectively, to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new google contract, which was effective april 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses.

* the other segment consists of the results of pricerunner, shoebuy and the princeton review for periods prior to the sales of these businesses, which occurred on march 18, 2016, december 30, 2016 and march 31, 2017, respectively. beginning in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the sales of these businesses, the other segment does not include any financial results.
for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
match group revenue increased 19% driven by international direct revenue growth of $146.3 million, or 38%, and north america direct revenue growth of $67.6 million, or 10%. both international and north america direct revenue growth were driven by higher average subscribers, up 33% and 9%, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in subscribers at tinder. total arpu increased 1%.
angi homeservices revenue increased 48% driven by growth of $152.5 million, or 36%, at marketplace (formerly homeadvisor domestic) and 55% at the european business. marketplace revenue growth was driven by a 37% increase in marketplace service requests to 18.1 million and a 26% increase in marketplace paying sps to 181,000. revenue growth at the european business was driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in myhammer on november 3, 2016 and mybuilder on march 24, 2017, as well as by organic growth across other regions. revenue in 2017 includes a contribution of $58.9 million from angie's list since the date of the combination, which reflects a reduction in revenue of $7.8 million due to the write-off of deferred revenue related to the combination.
video revenue increased 21% driven by the sales of the meyerowitz stories (new and selected) and the legacy of a whitetail deer hunter and the release of lady bird at iac films and strong growth at vimeo, which had ending subscribers of 873,000, an increase of 14% year-over-year, partially offset by a decline at electus.
applications revenue decreased 4% due to a decrease of $37.8 million, or 27%, in partnerships, partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million, or 3%, in consumer. partnerships revenue continued to decline due primarily to the loss of certain partners. the growth in consumer was due primarily to growth of 37% at apalon, driven by higher advertising and subscription revenue, and growth at slimware, driven by higher subscription revenue, partially offset by lower revenue per query at the consumer desktop applications business. apalon and slimware together comprised 16% of total applications revenue in 2017.
publishing revenue decreased 11% due to $58.8 million, or 20%, lower ask & other revenue, partially offset by $13.3 million, or 12%, higher premium brands revenue. ask & other revenue decreased due to declines in paid traffic primarily as a result of the google contract. premium brands revenue increase was due to growth at investopedia and dotdash due to an increase in organic traffic and advertising revenue.
for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
match group revenue increased 23% driven by higher average subscribers at both north america and international, up 22% and 46%, respectively, due primarily to growth in subscribers at tinder and the contribution from the 2015 acquisition of plentyoffish. this revenue growth was partially offset by a 6% decline in arpu. north america and international arpu
39

for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
operating income in 2017 increased from a loss in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in adjusted ebitda described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, a change of $3.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and an increase of $2.6 million in depreciation expense. the goodwill impairment charge at publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the
45
google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense in 2017 as a result of a publishing trade name and certain intangible assets from the plentyoffish acquisition now being fully amortized, partially offset by expense in 2017 related to the combination. amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to an increase of $140.3 million at angi homeservices due primarily to the modification and acceleration charges related to the combination, as well as an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled during the third quarter of 2017, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2016.
at december 31, 2017, there was $423.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
operating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in adjusted ebitda described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. the increase in goodwill impairment charges was due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at publishing in 2016 compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at shoebuy in 2015. the goodwill impairment charge at publishing was driven by the impact from the new google contract, which was effective april 1, 2016, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the then estimated fair value. the publishing goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. the change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in 2016 of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in 2015. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during 2016, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective april 1, 2016. the company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain publishing indefinite-lived trade names.

for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
match group adjusted ebitda increased 16% due primarily to an increase of $212.6 million in revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the ongoing product mix towards brands with lower marketing spend and a reduction in marketing spend at match group's affinity brands, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue, general and administrative expense and product development expense. general and administrative expense and product development expense increased due, in part, to expense of $12.7 million associated with the employer portion of payroll taxes and professional fees resulting from the tinder equity plan settlement.
angi homeservices adjusted ebitda decreased to $37.9 million, despite an increase of $237.5 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expense, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increase headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher marketplace revenue, outsourced customer service expense and software license and maintenance costs. the higher losses at the european businesses were driven primarily by the european expansion strategy, including increased investment in online and offline marketing and higher compensation costs. adjusted ebitda in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of homestars of $0.7 million.
video adjusted ebitda loss increased 43%, despite higher revenue, due to declines at electus and higher losses from vimeo (including the impact of deferred revenue write-offs of $2.1 million related to acquisition of livestream), partially offset by the contribution from iac films and reduced losses at daily burn. the increased adjusted ebitda loss at vimeo, despite higher revenue, reflects our investments in marketing and product development to grow the business.
applications adjusted ebitda increased 3%, despite a 4% decrease in revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs. adjusted ebitda in 2016 includes $2.6 million in restructuring costs.
publishing adjusted ebitda improved to a profit of $31.5 million in 2017 from a loss of $7.6 million in 2016, despite lower revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs resulting from restructurings in 2016 and the sale of askfm. results in 2016 included $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new google contract.
corporate adjusted ebitda loss increased $14.5 million due primarily to higher compensation costs and professional fees.
for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
match group adjusted ebitda increased 42% due primarily to higher revenue and a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue as the product mix continued to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue driven by a significant increase in in-app purchase fees. additionally, there were $11.8 million of lower costs in 2016 related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and european operations ($4.9 million in 2016 compared to $16.8 million in 2015).
angi homeservices adjusted ebitda increased 174% due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by an increased investment in online and offline marketing and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs. adjusted ebitda was further impacted by higher compensation due primarily to increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense due to higher marketplace revenue.
video adjusted ebitda loss improved 45% due primarily to reduced losses at vimeo and daily burn and increased profits at electus.
applications adjusted ebitda decreased 28% due primarily to lower revenue, partially offset by decreases in cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense. adjusted ebitda was further impacted by $2.6 million in restructuring charges.
publishing adjusted ebitda declined to a loss in 2016 due primarily to lower revenue and $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs during 2016 in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new google contract ($9.2 million in cost of revenue, $3.1 million in selling and marketing expense, $2.3 million in general and administrative expense and $1.2 million in product development expense). adjusted ebitda was further impacted by decreases in selling and marketing expense, cost of revenue and general and administrative expense exclusive of the restructuring charges.

interest expense in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to lower interest expense of $16.0 million related to the 2016 prepayment and 2017 repricing of the match group term loan and $6.6 million related to the repayment of the outstanding balances of the 4.875% senior notes and match group 6.75% senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2017. partially offsetting these decreases are increases of $10.9 million of interest expense associated with the match group 6.375% senior notes, $5.2 million from the issuance of the exchangeable notes, $1.8 million related to the match group 5.00% senior notes and $1.7 million from the angi homeservices term loan.
interest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the match group term loan in november 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on june 1, 2016 with the match group 6.375% senior notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the match group 6.75% senior notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 4.75% senior notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to repurchases and redemptions of the 4.875% and 4.75% senior notes during the year.

in 2017, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $291.1 million, which was due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, on january 1, 2017 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") discussed below. under asu no. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the exercise, purchase or settlement of stock-based awards of $361.8 million in 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax act. the tax act subjects to u.s. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017 ("transition tax") and implements a number of changes that take effect on january 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on intangible income earned by foreign subsidiaries. the company's income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2017 includes an expense of $63.8 million related to the tax act, of which, $62.7 million relates to the transition tax and $1.1 million relates to the remeasurement of u.s. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. the company has sufficient current year net operating losses to offset the taxable income resulting from the transition tax and, therefore, will not be required to pay the one-time transition tax.
the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ("e&p") of the company's foreign subsidiaries. to determine the amount of the transition tax, the company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 e&p of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-u.s. income taxes paid on such earnings. the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and has recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $62.7 million. any adjustment of the company's provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act. the company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax and expects to finalize its calculation prior to the filing of its u.s. federal tax return, which is due on october 15, 2018. the additional information includes, but is not limited to, the allocation and sourcing of income and deductions in 2017 for purposes of calculating the utilization of foreign tax credits. in addition, our estimates may also be impacted and adjusted as the law is clarified and additional guidance is issued at the federal and state levels.
in 2016, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%. the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of shoebuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the publishing segment.
in 2015, the company recorded an income tax provision of $29.5 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 21%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.

principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of non-gaap measure adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to iac's statement of operations of certain expenses.
for a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to iac shareholders to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 see "note 14-segment information" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data."
non-cash expenses that are excluded from non-gaap measure stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the combination), of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), performance-based rsus and market-based awards. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based rsus and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). upon the exercise of stock options and market-based stock options, the awards are gross settled, and the vesting of rsus, performance-based rsus and market-based awards rsus, the awards are settled, on a net basis, with the company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the combination). at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as contractor and service professional relationships, technology, customer lists and user base, content, trade names and membership, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

in accrued advertising at match group. the increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to growth in subscription sales at match group and vimeo, as well as growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals at angi homeservices, partially offset by decreases at electus and notional mainly due to the delivery of programming related to various production deals.

liquidity and capital resources the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows generated from operations. iac's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2017 were $1.6 billion, of which $272.6 million was held by match group and $221.5 million was held by angi homeservices. the company generated $416.7 million of operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2017, of which $321.1 million was generated by match group and $41.8 million was generated by angi homeservices. each of match group and angi homeservices is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, we cannot freely access the cash of match group and angi homeservices and their respective subsidiaries. in addition, agreements governing match group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or match group's leverage ratio (as defined in the match group indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. in addition, the agreement governing angi homeservices' term loan limits the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or angi homeservices' leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan facility) exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2017, there are no restrictions on match group's or angi homeservices' ability to pay dividends under these debt agreements.
iac has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. match group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on october 7, 2020. at december 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility or the match group credit facility.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company's 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2017 by approximately 20% to 25%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures for angi homeservices and match group related to the
55
development of capitalized software to support our products and services and for angi homeservices' new corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower capital expenditures at corporate.
at december 31, 2017, iac had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
in may 2017, the board of directors of match group authorized match group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock. match group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization.
the company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. these equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. the value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries. accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price. these interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation. the interests are ultimately settled in iac common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration. these equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. the number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate. the number of iac common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for match group and angi homeservices subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at december 31, 2017 is 0.1 million shares. withholding taxes, which will be paid by the company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $15.2 million at december 31, 2017, assuming a 50% withholding rate.
in july 2017, tinder, inc. ("tinder") was merged into match group and as a result, all tinder denominated equity awards were converted into match group tandem stock options ("tandem awards"). all of the tandem awards exercised during 2017 were exercised on a net basis and settled in iac common shares. assuming all vested and unvested match group tandem awards outstanding on december 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using iac stock, 0.8 million iac common shares would have been issued in settlement. match group would have remitted $102.4 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 3.3 million of its common shares to iac as reimbursement.
in connection with the combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights that related to common stock of homeadvisor (us) were converted into stock appreciation rights that are settleable in class a shares of angi homeservices. iac has the right to settle these awards using shares of iac common stock. assuming all vested and unvested stock appreciation rights outstanding on december 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using iac stock, 1.4 million iac common shares would have been issued in settlement. angi homeservices would have remitted $171.3 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 16.4 million of its common shares to iac as reimbursement.
as of december 31, 2017, iac's economic and voting interest in match group is 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively, and in angi homeservices is 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively. certain match group and angi homeservices equity awards can be settled either in iac common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at iac's election. the company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in iac shares to maintain an economic interest in both match group and angi homeservices of at least 80%.
the company will not be required to pay the one-time transition tax under the tax act because of its net operating loss position. the company does not expect to be a full u.s. federal cash income tax payer until 2021, which is in line with previous estimates. we expect the tax act to favorably impact our future liquidity, primarily as a result of a reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability.
the company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. the company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions,
56

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from these estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements acquisitions are an important part of the company's growth strategy. the company invested $912.1 million (including the value of angi homeservices class a common stock issued in connection with the combination), $36.1 million and $650.7 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
in connection with certain business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. the changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is the company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $459.1 million and $320.6 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. in performing its annual assessment, the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the match group, angi homeservices, vimeo and applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. the primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:
•   match group's october 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and match group's strong operating performance.
•   angi homeservices' october 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and angi homeservices' strong operating performance.
•   the company performed valuations of the vimeo and applications reporting units during 2017. these valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses. the valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, october 1, 2017. the fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its october 1, 2017 carrying value.
the company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment. for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2017, the company
59
quantitatively tested the daily burn and electus reporting units. the company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. the company's publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.
the aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million.
the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
the fair value of the company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year. the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016. determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. from the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of october 1. in 2017, the company did not quantitatively assess the angie's list indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the combination given the proximity of the september 29, 2017 transaction date to the october 1, 2017 annual test date. the company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in both 2017 and 2016.
the 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments. while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. the 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the shoebuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.
recoverability and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, the company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
60
that these lives may be changed. the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $519.8 million and $341.1 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of deferred tax assets (liabilities), net, is $31.3 million and $(226.3) million, respectively.
the company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. recognition (step one) occurs when the company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. de-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company has unrecognized tax benefits of $39.7 million and $41.0 million, including interest and penalties, respectively. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
no income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $101.2 million at december 31, 2017. the estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be $7.9 million.
stock-based compensation the company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $264.6 million, $104.8 million and $105.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. included in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 is $122.1 million related to the modification of previously issued homeadvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into angi homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued angie's list equity awards and the acceleration of certain angie's list equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the combination. the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the combination) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 using a black-scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. for stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2017, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $5.3 million, $20.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
marketable securities and long-term investments at december 31, 2017, marketable securities of $5.0 million consist of commercial paper rated a1+/p1. long-term investments at december 31, 2017 of $65.0 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.
the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each
61
quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. the company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. additionally, the company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the company's investments to decline.
the company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million, $10.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.

item 7:   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. we design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. our industrial automation products include collaborative robots used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:
   semiconductor test (semiconductor test) systems;

   defense/aerospace (defense/aerospace) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (storage test) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (production board test) systems (collectively these products represent system test);

   industrial automation (industrial automation) products; and

   wireless test (wireless test) systems.

we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (idms), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (osats), original equipment manufacturers (oems), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ics), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots.
the market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. one customer drives significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customers supply partners. we expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.
in 2015, we acquired universal robots a/s (universal robots), the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are low-cost, easy-to-deploy and simple-to-program robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. universal robots is a separate operating and reportable segment, industrial automation. the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing system test and wireless test segments. the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately $315 million, which included cash paid of approximately $284 million and $32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018. contingent consideration for the period from july 2015 to december 2017 was $24.5 million and is expected to be paid in march 2018. contingent consideration for 2015 was $15 million and was paid in february 2016. the remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is $25 million.
we believe our recent acquisition has enhanced our opportunities for growth. we intend to continue to invest in our business, grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs.
the sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. these cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a
24
significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries. historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector.
in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (who had previously contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million, with approximately $8.0 million of goodwill remaining, and $83.3 million for the impairment of acquired intangible assets with approximately $3.6 million of acquired intangible assets remaining at december 31, 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize revenues, including revenues from distributors, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states. outside the united states, we recognize revenues upon shipment or at delivery destination point, even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers, provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customers use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business.
our equipment has non-software and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipments essential functionality. revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit.
for multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenues to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenues to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (besp). for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control.
25
our post-shipment obligations include installation, training services, one-year standard warranties, and extended warranties. installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. we defer revenues for the selling price of installation and training. extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenues in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) 605-20, separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts and asc 605-25, revenue recognition multiple-element arrangements. service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed.
our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized. we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues.
we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products.
translation of non-u.s. currencies the functional currency for all non-u.s. subsidiaries is the u.s. dollar, except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency. all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. all foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates. net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other (income) expense, net. for industrial automation, assets and liabilities are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
retirement and postretirement plans we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. on a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write-downs or write-offs are identified through the quarterly review process. the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses.
equity incentive and stock purchase plans stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718, compensationstock compensation. upon adoption of accounting standards update (asu) 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, in the first quarter of 2017, we made an accounting policy election to continue accounting for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizing compensation costs only for those stock-based compensation awards expected to vest. in accordance with asu 2016-09, starting in the first quarter of
26
2017, excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and are reported as cash flows from operating activities. a cumulative effect adjustment of $39.1 million for any prior year excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies not previously recorded was recorded as an increase to retained earnings and deferred tax assets. all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows. in 2017, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $6.3 million, related to net excess tax benefit.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740, accounting for income taxes. this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized.
investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 320-10, investmentsdebt and equity securities. on a quarterly basis, we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other-than-temporary impairment. factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include:
   the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

   the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and

   the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (who had previously contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million, with approximately $8.0 million of goodwill remaining.
no goodwill impairment was identified in the fourth quarter of 2017, 2016 and 2015, as part of the annual goodwill impairment test.
27
we assess the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends.
as a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2016 described above, we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets based on the comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and recorded an $83.3 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge, with approximately $3.6 million of intangible assets remaining at december 31, 2017. there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of acquired intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable in 2017 and 2015, as such no impairment test was performed. when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks.

the increase in semiconductor test revenues of $294.3 million, or 22%, from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales in the microcontroller, power management, flash memory, and automotive safety test segments and an increase in service revenues. the increase in semiconductor test revenues of $166.7 million, or 14%, from 2015 to 2016 was driven primarily by system-on-a-chip (soc) product volume in the mobile application processor market.
the increase in system test revenues of $2.3 million, or 1%, from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher service revenue in defense/aerospace test instrumentation and systems. the decrease in system test revenues of $21.8 million, or 10%, from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers.
the increase in industrial automation revenues of $71.1 million, or 72%, from 2016 to 2017 was due to higher demand for collaborative robots. the acquisition of universal robots, completed in june 2015, added $99.0 million of revenues in 2016 and $41.9 million of revenues in 2015.
the increase in wireless test revenues of $15.7 million, or 16%, from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue. the decrease in wireless test revenues of $88.4 million, or 48%, from 2015 to 2016 was driven by lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems primarily from our largest wireless test segment customer.

our product revenues increased $331.5 million, or 23%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher sales across all semiconductor test products and higher sales in industrial automation. service revenues, which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support increased $51.9 million, or 17%.
our product revenues increased $112.6 million, or 8%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher volume in the mobile application processor market in semiconductor test and the addition of universal robots in june 2015, partially offset by a decrease in wireless test revenues due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems and lower sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers for cloud storage.
in 2017, revenues from one customer accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues. in 2016, two customers each accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues. in 2015, revenues from one customer accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues. in each of the years, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 32%, 36%, and 34%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. we estimate product

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on-hand and on-order inventory positions. forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand. this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test, industrial automation and system test segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded an inventory provision of $8.8 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. of the $8.8 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $4.6 million was related to semiconductor test, $2.2 million was related to wireless test, and $1.9 million was related to system test.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded an inventory provision of $17.5 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. of the $17.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $9.7 million was in semiconductor test, $7.2 million was in wireless test and $0.6 million was related to system test.
31
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded an inventory provision of $21.3 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $15.3 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $8.2 million was for our 2.5 hard disk drive testers in storage test, $4.5 million was in semiconductor test and $2.5 million was in wireless test; and

   a $6.0 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition in semiconductor test.

during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we scrapped $14.4 million, $15.2 million and $7.0 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $7.5 million, $10.0 million and $7.9 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written-down or written-off totaling $102.9 million. we have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.

the increase of $32.6 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to higher variable compensation across all segments and higher spending in universal robots, partially offset by lower spending in wireless test.
the increase of $9.4 million in selling and administrative expenses from 2015 to 2016 was due to $22.6 million of additional costs as a result of the acquisition of universal robots in june 2015, partially offset by lower pension expense related to $0.9 million of actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of $4.8 million in 2015, and lower variable compensation.

acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2016 to 2017 primarily in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 and in the industrial automation segment due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in june 2017. acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to lower amortization expense in the wireless test segment due to the impairment of acquired intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition in june 2015.
goodwill impairment we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. in the second quarter of 2016, the wireless test reporting unit (which is our wireless test operating and reportable segment) reduced headcount by 11% as a result of a sharp decline in projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market. the decrease in projected demand was due to lower forecasted buying from our largest wireless test segment customer (which had contributed between 51% and 73% of annual wireless test sales since the litepoint acquisition in 2011 through 2015) as a result of the customers numerous operational efficiencies; slower smartphone growth rates; and a slowdown of new wireless technology adoption. we considered the headcount reduction and sharp decline in projected demand to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. following the interim goodwill impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $254.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. the fourth quarter 2017, 2016 and 2015 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments.
acquired intangible assets impairment we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. if undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment contain managements best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time. as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016, we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets. as a result of the analysis, we recorded an $83.3 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 in acquired intangible assets impairment on the statements of operations.
restructuring and other during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded an expense of $7.8 million for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability, $3.8 million of severance charges related to headcount reduction of 91 people, of which 75 people were in semiconductor test and 8 people each in industrial automation and in corporate, $1.1 million for an impairment of fixed assets in semiconductor test, $1.0 million for a lease impairment of a wireless test facility in sunnyvale, ca, which was terminated in september 2017, and $0.8 million of expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto, japan, partially offset by $5.1 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake.
33
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded an expense of $15.9 million for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, of which $15.3 million was related to universal robots and $0.6 million was related to ait, $6.0 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 146 people, of which 102 people were in wireless test and 44 people were in semiconductor test, $4.2 million for an impairment of fixed assets, and $0.9 million for expenses related to an earthquake in kumamoto, japan, partially offset by $5.1 million of property insurance recovery related to the japan earthquake.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded an expense of $5.3 million for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability, $1.5 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test, and $1.0 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots, partially offset by a $2.9 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability, of which $1.6 million was related to ztec and $1.3 million was related to ait.
the remaining accrual for severance of $1.4 million is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings on the balance sheet and is expected to be paid by december 2018.

the increase in income before income taxes in semiconductor test from 2016 to 2017 was driven primarily by increased sales and higher gross margin due to favorable product mix. the increase in income before income taxes in wireless test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in 2016, lower intangible assets amortization, lower operating expenses, higher demand for connectivity test systems and higher service revenue in 2017. the decrease in income before income taxes in system test from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to lower sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and increased spending for new product development. the increase in income before income taxes in industrial automation was due primarily to higher demand for collaborative robots.
the decrease in income before income taxes from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a $254.9 million goodwill impairment charge and an $83.3 million acquired intangible assets impairment charge related to wireless test in 2016, and amortization of intangible assets related to our june 2015 acquisition of universal robots, which is our industrial automation segment, partially offset by higher revenues in the semiconductor test application processor market and $3.2 million of pension actuarial gains in 2016 as compared to actuarial losses of $17.7 million in 2015.
income taxes income tax expense for 2017 totaled $266.7 million. income tax benefit for 2016 totaled $11.6 million. income tax expense for 2015 totaled $46.6 million. the effective tax rate for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 50.9%, 21.1%, and 18.4% respectively.
the increase in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable to the effect of changes in u.s. federal tax law. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax reform act), making significant changes to the internal revenue code. among other changes, the tax reform act permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, shifts the u.s. tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial tax system and requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred.
we recorded a provisional amount of $186.0 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represents our best estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with our understanding of the tax reform act and available guidance as of the date of this filing. the $186.0 million is primarily composed of expense of $161.0 million related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, $33.6 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and benefit of $10.3 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions.
the change in the effective rate was also impacted by the u.s. non-deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016, a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the u.s. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, decreases in the discrete benefits from tax reserve releases, increases in discrete expense from non-taxable foreign exchange gains and losses and an increase in the discrete benefit from stock-based compensation.
the increase in the effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the u.s. relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, reductions in uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of statutes and the settlement of an audit, and an increase in non-taxable foreign exchange gains. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the effect of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, which reduced the benefit of the loss before income taxes in the u.s.

we qualify for a tax holiday in singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the singapore economic development board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $24.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share, $17.0 million or $0.08 per diluted share, and $11.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, respectively. the tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2020.

in january 2017, may 2017, august 2017 and november 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. total dividend payments in 2017 were $55.4 million.
in january 2016, may 2016, august 2016 and november 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2016 were $48.6 million.
in january 2015, may 2015, august 2015 and november 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2015 were $50.7 million.
in january 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share to be paid on march 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of february 23, 2018. payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.
in january 2015, our board of directors cancelled the november 2010 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $500 million of common stock. in 2015, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $19.20, for a total cost of $300.0 million. in 2016, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $21.39, for a total cost of $146.3 million. the cumulative repurchases as of december 31, 2016 totaled 22.5 million shares of common stock for $446 million at an average price per share of $19.87.
in december 2016, our board of directors cancelled the january 2015 stock repurchase program and approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization which commenced on january 1, 2017. the cumulative repurchases as of december 31, 2017 totaled 5.8 million shares of common stock for $200.3 million at an average price per share of $34.30.
in january 2018, our board of directors cancelled the december 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. we intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018.
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.
retirement plans asc 715-20, compensationretirement benefitsdefined benefit plans, requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 715-20. the pension asset or liability
38
represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31. for other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, our pension income, which includes the u.s. qualified pension plan (u.s. plan), certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries, and a u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit plan, was approximately $(2.1) million. the largest portion of our 2017 pension income was $(7.9) million for our u.s. plan. pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense (income) and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.
in developing the expected return on u.s. plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. we believe that 4.0% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2017. the december 31, 2017 asset allocation for our u.s. plan was 88% invested in fixed income securities, 10% invested in equity securities, and 2% invested in other securities. our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.
we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the u.s. plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the u.s. plans expected cash flows and was 3.4% at december 31, 2017, down from 3.9% at december 31, 2016. we estimate that in 2018 we will recognize approximately $(1.8) million of pension income for the u.s. plan. the u.s. plan pension income estimate for 2018 is based on a 3.4% discount rate and a 4.3% return on assets. future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.
as of december 31, 2017, our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of $0.1 million.
we performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential u.s. plan (income) expense for the year ending december 31, 2018, which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2018 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.

the assets of the u.s. plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. u.s. plan assets have increased from $307.3 million at december 31, 2016 to $324.5 million at december 31, 2017 while the u.s. plans liability increased from $299.6 million at december 31, 2016 to $307.0 million at december 31, 2017.
39
our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. during 2017, we made contributions of $1.9 million to the u.s. plan, $2.6 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan, and $0.9 million to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries. in 2018, we expect to contribute approximately $1.9 million to the u.s. plan and $2.5 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan. contributions to be made in 2018 to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $0.9 million.
equity compensation plans in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o: stock-based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements, we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan (the 2006 equity plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25, 2006.
at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder. at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 12, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to extend its term until may 12, 2025.
the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31, 2017 (share numbers in thousands):

(2)   consists of 8,604,184 securities available for issuance under the 2006 equity plan and 3,094,756 of securities available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.

(3)                                              in connection with the 2011 acquisition of litepoint corporation (the litepoint acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the litepoint corporation
2002 stock plan (the litepoint plan). upon the consummation of the litepoint acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 2,828,344 shares of our common stock. no additional awards will be granted under the litepoint plan. as of december 31, 2017, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 225,456 shares of our common stock pursuant to the litepoint plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.41 per share.

the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees, officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne. the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31, 2017 was 8,604,184 shares of our common stock. the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards in the form of (1) non-qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting
40
measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors, which administers the 2006 equity plan. awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. the maximum number of shares of stock-based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock.

recently issued accounting pronouncements on february 15, 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, income statementreporting comprehensive income (topic 220): reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. this asu allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.
on march 10, 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-07, compensationretirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. this asu provides guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the new standard requires the service cost component to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. the other components of net benefit cost such as interest cost, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are required to be presented separately outside of income or loss from operations. the presentation of service cost should be applied

retrospectively. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. this guidance will impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. upon adoption of the new standard, we will present interest cost, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses within other (income) expense, net.
on january 26, 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment. the new guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. all other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. the same one-step impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units, even those with zero or negative carrying amounts. entities will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill at reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. the revised guidance will be applied prospectively, and is effective in 2020. early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.
in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, accounting for income taxes: intra-entity asset transfers of assets other than inventory. under current generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. the new guidance requires recognition of the tax expense from the sale of the asset in the sellers tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyers jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer. the new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. the income tax consequences from the sale of inventory from one member of a consolidated entity to another will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold to a third party. the new guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted. the modified retrospective approach will be required for transition to the new guidance, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and statements of cash flows.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842). the guidance in this asu supersedes the lease recognition requirements in accounting standards codification (asc) topic 840, leases. the new standard establishes a right-of-use (rou) model that requires a lessee to record an rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations. the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, financial instrumentsoverall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. this asu provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. the new pronouncement revises accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. among other things, it amends the presentation and disclosure requirements of equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. changes in the fair value of these equity securities will be recognized directly in net income. this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which will replace numerous requirements in u.s. gaap, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, fasb issued asu 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. for us, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018. the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. we have selected the modified retrospective transition method. we have completed our preliminary assessment of the financial statement impact of the new standard and expect that the cumulative effect adjustment recognized to retained earnings on january 1, 2018 will be approximately $12 million, primarily as a result of recognizing revenues for software licenses at the time of delivery since the vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe) requirement for undelivered elements such as post-contract support is eliminated. companies are allowed to use established or best estimate selling price for the undelivered element to allocate and defer the revenue. as a result, we will recognize as revenue upon delivery of the software and defer a portion of the sales price for the estimated selling price of post-contract support, compared to the current practice of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the term of the post-contract support period due to the lack of vsoe. the $12 million adjustment to retained earnings reflects acceleration of approximately $16 million in revenues net of less than $1 million in cost of revenues and approximately $3 million of income tax expense. this preliminary assessment is based on a review of the types and number of revenue arrangements in place, including the review of individual customer contracts. based on our preliminary assessment, we do not expect any major changes to be made to existing accounting systems or internal controls.

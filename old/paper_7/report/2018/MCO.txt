item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moodys corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
this md&a contains forward-looking statements. see forward-looking statements commencing on page 57 and item  1a. risk factors commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.
the company moodys is a provider of (i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) learning solutions and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. moodys reports in two reportable segments: mis and ma.
mis, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. additionally, mis earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations, which consist primarily of financial instrument pricing services in the asia-pacific region as well as revenue from icras non-ratings operations. the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment.
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. within its rd&a business, ma offers subscription based research, data and analytical products, including credit ratings produced by mis, credit research, quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools, economic research and forecasts, business intelligence and company information products, and commercial real estate data and analytical tools. within its ers business, ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. the ps business provides offshore analytical and research services along with learning solutions and certification programs.
critical accounting estimates moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, moodys evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, restructuring, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, and income taxes. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets on july 31st of each year, moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., mis and ma), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).
the company has eight primary reporting units: two within the companys ratings business (one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moodys other ratings operations) and six reporting units within ma: content, ers, mals (formerly fstc), maks, bureau van dijk and reis. the content reporting unit offers subscription based research, data and analytical products, including credit ratings produced by mis, credit research, quantitative credit scores and other analytical tools, economic research and forecasts, business intelligence and company information products, and credit analytical tools. the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis. the mals reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training. the maks reporting unit provides offshore research and analytical services. the bureau van dijk reporting unit consists of the bureau van dijk business, which was acquired on august 10, 2017, and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products. the reis reporting unit, consists of the newly acquired reis business, and provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools.

the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. in the first step, the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the company is not required to perform further testing. if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value in accordance with asu no. 2017-04, intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350), simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the companys accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years.
at july 31, 2018, the company performed quantitative assessments of the ers, mals, maks and icra reporting units and a qualitative assessment for the remaining reporting units. no quantitative assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. each qualitative analysis resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.
the company quantitatively tested the ers, mals, maks and icra reporting units as of july 31, 2018 due to the factors outlined below:
»                                                                        ers  this reporting unit was quantitatively assessed to update its valuation to reflect the current assumptions relating to the timing of a strategic shift in the business away from lower margin sales of highly customized software solutions to higher margin saas sales. this migration to saas sales is expected to contribute to a more stable and more profitable base of recurring revenue over the medium to long-term. in 2018, the company revised its projections for ers to reflect a faster deterioration of the lower margin sales of highly customized software solutions than was previously projected in 2017.

»             mals and maks  these reporting units were quantitatively assessed at the discretion of the company as they have historically been the reporting units with the lowest amount by which the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.

»   icra  this reporting unit was tested quantitatively due to it having a readily available fair value based on its stock price.

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset (including its estimated useful life) involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital, the effects of external factors and market conditions as well as appropriate comparable market metrics. however, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates and the time frame of such changes may be rapid. in addition, the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.
other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

(1)   omega performance was acquired subsequent to the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment as of july 31, 2018. goodwill related to this acquisition is reported within the mals reporting unit.

(2)                            bureau van dijk was acquired in august 2017 and has not yet been subject to a quantitative goodwill assessment. the purchase price approximates the fair value of the reporting unit at july 31, 2018, and accordingly, bureau van dijk was not subject to the sensitivity analysis above.

(3)                             reis was acquired in october 2018, subsequent to the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment as of july 31, 2018. due to the close proximity of the reis acquisition to december 31, 2018, the purchase price approximates the fair value of the reporting unit.

methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:
the following is a discussion regarding the companys methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding icra, as of the date of each reporting units last quantitative assessment (july 31, 2018 for ers, mals, and maks and july 31, 2016 for mis and content). as icra is a publicly traded company in india, the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.
the fair value of each reporting unit, excluding icra, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the companys financial position and results of operations. moodys allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.
the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions described below are as of each reporting units last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:
»                                                                       future cash flow assumptions the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. these projections are consistent with the companys operating budget and strategic plan. cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new products. beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates. a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. for each reporting unit analyzed, a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rates used would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.

»                                                                       wacc the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting units estimated future cash flows. the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. the cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting units cash flows. the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated

moodys 2018 10-k   33
with all of the companys outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc. the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 10.5% as of the date of the reporting units most recent quantitative assessment. differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of the date of the reporting units last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. for each reporting unit analyzed, an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not result in its carrying value exceeding its fair value.

income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. the companys tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740. therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.
the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps. the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the companys consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.
for utps, asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company, there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the companys operating results or financial condition.
on december 22, 2017, the tax act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to u.s. corporate tax laws. the tax act includes a mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax (transition tax) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the tax act, in 2017 the company recorded a provisional estimate of $247.3 million related to the transition tax in 2017. in 2018, the irs issued notices clarifying certain aspects of the transition tax. as a result, the company reduced its provision for the transition tax by $10.9 million. the irs may issue additional regulations or notices in future periods to clarify or amend provisions of the tax act and such guidance could result in revisions in future periods to the amounts recorded for the existing provisions and interpretations of the tax act. in addition, in 2018 the company recorded a deferred tax asset of $48.1 million related to potential foreign tax credits which could be realized if certain utps resulted in tax assessments. the transition tax liability reported on the companys 2017 tax return is payable over eight years starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest. due to the reduction in u.s. corporate income tax rates beginning in 2018, a decrease of $56.2 million was recorded to net deferred tax assets in 2017. the above amounts may be impacted by a number of additional considerations, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and the companys ongoing analysis of the new law.
pursuant to the tax act being signed into law, all previously undistributed foreign earnings became subject to u.s. tax. in light of u.s tax reform, the company has reassessed its capital allocation strategy, including reevaluating its global cash position and revising its plans for repatriating or reinvesting foreign earnings. the company regularly evaluates in which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the u.s. the company has provided non-u.s. deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s.
revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
the discussion below outlines areas of the companys revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the companys accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer.
34   moodys 2018 10-k determination of performance obligations:
when contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct.
in the companys mis segment, revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations, initial rating fees and the related monitoring services. revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer, whereas revenue from monitoring related to miss ratings is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed.
in the ma segment, contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. when arrangements for software, content or saas licenses also include related implementation services, the company may be required to exercise significant judgment in determining the level of integration and interdependency between the promise to grant the software license and the promise to deliver the related implementation services. this determination influences whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately (with revenue generally being recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer), or not distinct and accounted for together with the implementation services (with revenue being recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed).
allocating consideration to performance obligations:
management judgment is also required in the determination of the ssp, which is utilized to allocate the consideration from a contract with a customer to each distinct performance obligation.
in the mis segment, the company allocates the transaction price within arrangements that include multiple elements based upon the relative ssp of each service at contract inception. the ssp for monitoring fees in these arrangements is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the monitoring service is sold separately. the company generally utilizes managements best estimate of ssp for initial rating fees and considers all available data points. mis generally provides initial ratings only in transactions with customers that include monitoring services related to the rating.
in the ma segment, revenue is generally allocated to all performance obligations based upon the relative ssp at contract inception. for performance obligations where an observable price exists, such as pcs, the observable price is utilized. if an observable price does not currently exist, the company will utilize managements best estimate of ssp for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points.
the ssp in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer, nature of product/services, and other attributes related to those products and services. once ssp is determined for each performance obligation, the transaction price, including any discount, is allocated based on the relative ssp of the separate performance obligations.
costs to obtain a contract with a customer:
costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs. these costs are amortized to expense consistent with the recognition pattern of the related revenue over time. depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals. determining the estimated economic life of the products sold requires judgment with respect to anticipated future technological changes/product enhancements.
contingencies accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. in many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent managements best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.
for claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. in other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if material.
moodys 2018 10-k   35
as additional information becomes available, the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. the company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. however, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.
the companys wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including, but not limited to, deductibles for workers compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the company. in addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. for matters insured by the companys insurance subsidiary, moodys records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of managements best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. defense costs for matters not self-insured by the companys wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.
accounts receivable allowances and contract assets moodys records variable consideration in respect of estimated future adjustments to customer billings as an adjustment to revenue, using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business. such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance, or to contract assets. additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. actual billing adjustments are recorded against the allowance, or contract asset, depending on the nature of the adjustment. actual uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance. moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. based on its analysis, moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. accordingly, moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. management believes that the allowance is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. however, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could impact the companys consolidated results of operations.
pension and other retirement benefits the expenses, assets and liabilities that moodys reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. these significant assumptions include the following:
»   future compensation increases based on the companys long-term actual experience and future outlook;

»                 long-term expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plans portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and

»   discount rates based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

the discount rates used to measure the present value of the companys benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31, 2018 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve. the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.
moodys major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. in determining these assumptions, the company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the companys retirement plans. additionally, the company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale mp-2018 to accompany the rp-2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the society of actuaries.
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the company amortizes, as a component of annual
36   moodys 2018 10-k pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. for moodys retirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of december 31, 2018 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $83.5 million, and moodys expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $3.6 million in 2019 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.
for moodys funded u.s. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense. as permitted under asc topic 715, the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. as of december 31, 2018, the company has an unrecognized asset loss of $12.5 million, of which $4.3 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2020 expense.
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moodys 2019 income before provision for income taxes. these effects have been calculated using the companys current projections of 2019 expenses, assets and liabilities related to moodys retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.

a one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2019 projected expenses. based on current projections, the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be approximately $24 million in 2019, a decrease compared to the $30.7 million recognized in 2018.
restructuring the company has engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments. if the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted. for a full description of moodys restructuring actions, refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
other estimates in addition, there are other accounting estimates within moodys consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moodys consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moodys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moodys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moodys.
reportable segments the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31, 2018: mis and ma.
the mis segment is comprised primarily of all of the companys ratings operations consisting of five lobs  cfg, sfg, fig, ppif and mis other. the ratings lobs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. the mis other lob consists of certain non-ratings operations managed by mis, which consists of non-rating revenue from icra and fixed income pricing service operations in the asia-pacific region.
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets as well as serving as provider of business intelligence and company information. the ma segment consists of three lines of business  rd&a, ers and ps. the results of operations for ma for the year ended december 31, 2018 include the financial results from omega performance and reis, which were acquired in august 2018 and october 2018, respectively. revenue for the ps lob includes financial results from omega performance and revenue for rd&a lob includes financial results from reis.
moodys 2018 10-k   37
the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company and its reportable segments. total mis revenue and total ma expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by mis. the royalty rate charged by mis approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by mis. total ma revenue and total mis expenses include intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in miss ratings process. these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services. overhead charges and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company that benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and legal.

executive summary
»                                                                  moodys completed the acquisition of bureau van dijk on august 10, 2017. moodys results of operations include bureau van dijks operating results beginning as of august 11, 2017. additionally, moodys completed the acquisitions of omega performance and reis on august 16, 2018 and october 15, 2018, respectively. in the discussion below, reference to inorganic revenue growth refers to bureau van dijks operating results from january 1, 2018 through and including august 10, 2018 as well as reis and omega performance revenue from their respective acquisitions dates through december 31, 2018.

»   moodys revenue in 2018 totaled $4,442.7 million, an increase of $238.6 million, or 6%, compared to 2017, reflecting growth in ma being partially offset by declines in mis.

»   mis external revenue was 2% lower compared to the prior year reflecting:

»               lower non-financial corporate and infrastructure rated issuance volumes reflecting the confluence of unfavorable market factors, with the impact most notable in the fourth quarter of 2018;

»   a decline in u.s. public finance issuance resulting from certain provisions of the tax act;

partially offset by:
»   benefits from a favorable product mix and pricing increases;

»   an increase in new ratings mandates; and

»   demand for floating rate instruments (most notably in the first half of 2018), which resulted in strong clo formation.

»   ma external revenue grew 21% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting:

»   approximately $202 million of inorganic revenue growth from the acquisitions of bureau van dijk, reis and omega, or approximately 14 percentage points of the growth; and

»   strong growth in the credit research and rating data feeds product lines within rd&amp;a.

»   total operating and sg&amp;a expenses increased $123.1 million, or 6% compared to 2017, with the most notable driver being approximately $120 million of inorganic expense growth from the aforementioned acquisitions.

»   the restructuring charge in 2018 relates to a restructuring program approved in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

»   d&amp;a increased $33.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the bureau van dijk acquisition.

»                                                                 operating income of $1,868.2 million in 2018 increased $47.4 million compared to 2017 and resulted in an operating margin of 42.1%, compared to 43.3% in the prior year. adjusted operating income of $2,117.1 million in 2018 increased $115.5 million compared to 2017, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 47.7% compared to 47.6% in the prior year.

»             the change in total non-operating (expense) income, net compared to the prior year is primarily due to the $59.7 million ccxi gain and $111.1 million purchase price hedge gain in 2017.

»                                             the etr in 2018 was 21.0%, down from 43.6% for the prior-year period. the etr in 2018 benefitted from the impact of an enacted lower corporate tax rate in the u.s. pursuant to the tax act and lower non-u.s. effective tax rates. the etr in 2017 included a net charge of approximately $246 million related to the impacts of tax reform in the u.s. and belgium partially offset by the non-taxable ccxi gain.

transaction revenue accounted for 44% of global mco revenue in 2018 compared to 50% in 2017.
u.s. revenue of $2,329.6 million in 2018 decreased $18.8 million over the prior year reflecting declines in mis being partially offset by growth in ma.
non-u.s. revenue of $2,113.1 million increased $257.4 million from 2017 reflecting growth in both reportable segments, and included approximately $167 million of inorganic revenue growth from bureau van dijk.
operating expenses were $1,245.5 million in 2018, up $28.9 million from 2017, reflecting increases in non-compensation of approximately $38 million, partially offset by a decline in compensation cost of approximately $9 million. the increase in non-compensation costs is primarily due to inorganic expense growth related to the acquisitions of bureau van dijk, reis and omega. the decline in compensation costs reflects lower incentive compensation resulting from lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits expenses, which includes the impact of salary adjustments and hiring as well as inorganic expense growth related to the aforementioned acquisitions.
sg&a expenses of $1,080.1 million in 2018 increased $94.2 million from the prior year reflecting increases in non-compensation and compensation costs of approximately $65 million and $30 million, respectively. the increase in non-compensation costs primarily reflects inorganic expense growth related to the acquisition of bureau van dijk and higher legal costs. the increase in compensation costs reflects an increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses, which includes the impact of salary adjustments and hiring as well as inorganic expense growth related to the bureau van dijk, reis and omega performance acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year.
the restructuring charge of $48.7 million relates to a restructuring program approved in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
d&a increased $33.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the bureau van dijk acquisition.
operating income of $1,868.2 million in 2018 increased $47.4 million compared to 2017 and resulted in an operating margin of 42.1%, compared to 43.3% in the prior year. adjusted operating income of $2,117.1 million in 2018 increased $115.5 million compared to 2017, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 47.7% compared to 47.6% in the prior year.
interest expense, net in 2018 was $216.0 million, a $7.5 million increase in expense compared to 2017, primarily due to interest and fees on additional debt issued in 2017 to fund the acquisition of bureau van dijk and the issuance of additional notes issued in the second and fourth quarter of 2018, all of which are more fully discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. refer to the section entitled liquidity and capital resources of this md&a for further discussion regarding cash flows relating to the companys indebtedness. this increase was partially offset by benefits from cross-currency swaps executed in 2018, which are more fully discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, interest expense in 2017 included approximately $7 million due to the make whole amount on the prepayment of the series 2007-1 notes.
other non-operating income, net was $18.8 million in 2018, a $15.1 million increase compared to 2017 primarily reflecting lower fx losses of approximately $5 million coupled with gains on the companys investments in certain mutual funds.
additionally, moodys recognized the $59.7 million ccxi gain and the $111.1 million purchase price hedge gain in 2017.
the reduction in the etr to 21.0% in 2018 primarily reflects the impact of an enacted lower corporate tax rate in the u.s. pursuant to the tax act. additionally, the 2018 etr includes additional utps of approximately $64 million relating to certain non-u.s. matters partially offset by a decrease relating to the transition tax liability of approximately $59 million. furthermore, the 2018 etr includes the benefit from lower non-u.s. effective tax rates. the etr in 2017 was 43.6% and included a net charge of approximately $246 million related to the impacts of tax reform in the u.s. and belgium and tax on the purchase price hedge gain, which was taxed in a higher tax jurisdiction. these items were partially offset by the non-taxable ccxi gain in 2017.
diluted eps in 2018 of $6.74, which included a $0.19 restructuring charge, increased $1.59, or 31%, compared to 2017, which included both the $0.31 ccxi gain and the $0.37 purchase price hedge gain. adjusted diluted eps of $7.39 in 2018 increased $1.32, or 22%, compared to 2017 (refer to the section entitled non-gaap financial measures of this md&a for items excluded in the derivation of adjusted diluted eps). the favorable impact of the tax act on the etr contributed approximately 10 percentage points of the growth for both diluted eps and adjusted diluted eps.

the following is a discussion of external mis revenue and operating expenses:
global mis revenue of $2,712.4 million in 2018 was down 2% compared to 2017, reflecting declines in cfg and ppif being partially offset by growth in sfg and fig and the favorable impact of changes in product mix and pricing increases.
transaction revenue for mis was 62% in 2018, compared to 65% in 2017.
in the u.s., revenue was $1,619.2 million in 2018, down $83.6 million from 2017 reflecting declines in cfg and ppif.
non-u.s. revenue was $1,093.2 million in 2018, an increase of $22.2 million or 2%, compared to 2017, primarily reflecting strength in non-u.s. sfg revenue.
global cfg revenue of $1,334.1 million in 2018 declined 4% compared to 2017 and reflected lower corporate debt issuance (both investment-grade and speculative-grade) resulting from a confluence of unfavorable cyclical market factors which included: i) higher u.s. benchmark interest rates; ii) increased capital market volatility; iii) widening of credit spreads; and iv) an increase in u.s. corporate sector liquidity subsequent to u.s. tax reform. these declines were partially offset by changes in product mix and pricing increases coupled with growth in new ratings mandates, which resulted in higher monitoring fees in all regions. additionally, the decline compared to 2017 was partially offset by higher bank loan revenue in the first half of 2018 in the u.s. and emea resulting from favorable changes in product mix, m&a financing activity and investor demand for floating rate debt instruments earlier in the year. transaction revenue represented 69% and 73% of total cfg revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. in the u.s., revenue was $852.3 million, or 6% lower compared to the prior year. non-u.s. revenue of $481.8 million was approximately flat compared to the prior year.
global sfg revenue of $526.5 million in 2018 increased $31.0 million, or 6%, compared to 2017. in the u.s., revenue of $342.9 million increased $2.8 million over 2017 and reflected strength in clo formation resulting from an increase in the supply of collateral and favorable market conditions in the first half of 2018, which facilitated both new securitizations and ongoing refinancing activity. these increases were partially offset by declines in reit issuance compared to record issuance in 2017 coupled with lower cmbs issuance. non-u.s. revenue in 2018 of $183.6 million increased $28.2 million compared to the prior year. this growth primarily reflects increases across most asset classes in the emea region, most notably in structured credit which has benefited from increased availability of loan moodys 2018 10-k   41
collateral resulting from strength in leveraged loan issuance late in 2017 into early 2018. transaction revenue was 65% of total sfg revenue in both 2018 and 2017.
global fig revenue of $441.7 million in 2018 increased $5.9 million, or 1%, compared to 2017 primarily due to growth in the insurance sector reflecting issuance to fund m&a and refinancing activity as well as benefits from changes in product mix and pricing increases. these increases were partially offset by lower banking-related revenue in asia-pacific reflecting a decline in issuance from chinese financial institutions. in the u.s., revenue of $194.6 million increased 5% compared to the prior year. non-u.s. revenue was $247.1 million in 2018, down 1% compared to 2017. transaction revenue was 42% of total fig revenue in 2018, compared to 45% in the same period in 2017.
global ppif revenue was $391.1 million in 2018 and decreased 9% compared to 2017. in the u.s., revenue in 2018 was $228.8 million, a decrease of $37.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to lower u.s. public sector supply following the enactment of the tax act, which disallowed certain tax exemptions for advance refunding transactions. additionally, the decline reflects lower infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes. these decreases were partially offset by benefits from changes in product mix and pricing increases. outside the u.s., ppif revenue was $162.3 million and declined modestly compared to 2017. transaction revenue was 61% in 2018, compared to 65% in the same period of 2017.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2018 decreased $56.6 million compared to 2017 primarily due to approximately $98 million in lower incentive compensation accruals reflecting lower achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year. this decrease was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits costs reflecting salary adjustments and hiring coupled with higher legal costs.
the restructuring charge relates to a restructuring program approved in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
adjusted operating income and operating income in 2018, which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses, were $1,657.4 million and $1,560.3 million, respectively, and were generally in line with the prior year. operating income in 2018 included a $32.2 million restructuring charge. adjusted operating margin was 58.4%, or 130bps higher than the prior year. operating margin was 55.0% in 2018 compared to 54.5% in the prior year.

the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses:
global ma revenue increased $300.0 million, or 21%, compared to 2017, primarily due to growth in rd&a, which included approximately $202 million of inorganic revenue growth from the acquisitions of bureau van dijk, reis and omega performance, or 14
42   moodys 2018 10-k percentage points of the growth. additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from higher fees within mas recurring revenue base due to enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters. recurring revenue comprised 84% and 78% of total ma revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in the u.s., revenue of $710.4 million in 2018 increased $64.8 million, mainly reflecting growth in rd&a.
non-u.s. revenue of $1,019.9 million in 2018 was $235.2 million higher than in 2017 primarily reflecting growth in rd&a, which included approximately $167 million of inorganic growth from bureau van dijk.
global rd&a revenue of $1,134.1 million, which comprised 66% and 58% of total external ma revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively, increased $301.4 million, or 36%, over the prior year period. rd&a revenue in 2018 included approximately $198 million of inorganic revenue growth, or 24 percentage points of the growth, from the bureau van dijk and reis acquisitions. rd&a revenue growth also reflects strong results in the credit research and rating data feeds product lines, where enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters have generated higher fees, coupled with strong organic growth from bureau van dijk. u.s. revenue of $480.4 million and non-u.s. revenue of $653.7 million increased 13% and 60%, respectively, compared to 2017.
global ers revenue of $437.4 million in 2018 decreased $11.2 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. this decrease primarily reflects a decline in perpetual software license sales and related implementation services as the business continues to transition to saas products sold on a subscription basis. these decreases were partially offset by continued strong demand for subscription-based products and benefits from pricing increases within erss recurring revenue base. in the u.s., revenue of $170.0 million increased 2% compared to the prior year. non-u.s. revenue of $267.4 million decreased 5% compared to the prior year.
global ps revenue of $158.8 million in 2018 increased $9.8 million compared to 2017 reflecting higher revenue from analytical and research services in emea, which benefited from strong new sales and improved customer retention, coupled with growth in u.s. learning solutions revenue mainly due to the acquisition of omega performance. in the u.s., revenue in 2018 was $60.0 million, up 10% compared to 2017. non-u.s. revenue was $98.8 million, up 5% compared to 2017.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2018 increased $179.7 million compared to 2017 primarily due to approximately $120 million of inorganic expense growth from the bureau van dijk, reis and omega performance acquisitions. additionally, the increase reflects higher compensation costs primarily resulting from salary adjustments and hiring as well as higher incentive compensation reflecting higher achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year.
the restructuring charge relates to a restructuring program approved in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
depreciation and amortization increased $43.4 million primarily due to the amortization of bureau van dijks intangible assets.
adjusted operating income was $459.7 million in 2018 and increased $104.3 million compared to the same period in 2017. operating income of $307.9 million in 2018, which included a $16.5 million restructuring charge, increased $58.6 million compared to the same period in 2017. adjusted operating margin in 2018 was 26.4%, up 180bps from 2017. operating margin was 17.7% in 2018, up 50bps from the prior year, with the margin expansion being suppressed by the restructuring charge in 2018. adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.

executive summary
»   moodys completed the acquisition of bureau van dijk on august 10, 2017. moodys results of operations include bureau van dijks operating results beginning as of august 10, 2017.

»   moodys revenue in 2017 totaled $4,204.1 million, an increase of $599.9 million, or 17%, compared to 2016
reflecting strong growth in both segments.

»                                mis revenue was 17% higher compared to the prior year with growth across all ratings lobs. the most notable growth was in the cfg lob mainly due to strong leveraged finance issuance across all regions reflecting favorable market conditions and increased investor demand for higher yielding securities.

»                                                             ma revenue grew 16% compared to the prior year reflecting growth across all lobs. the most notable growth was in the rd&amp;a lob, which reflected increases in credit research subscriptions and licensing of credit data as well as an approximate $92 million contribution from bureau van dijk (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in note 8 to the financial statements, providing approximately seven additional percentage points to growth).

$863.8 million settlement charge in 2016. this decrease is partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2017, which reflects growth in performance-based compensation resulting from strong financial performance in 2017 coupled with annual merit increases. additionally, there was approximately $64 million in bureau van dijk operating expenses and $22.5 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2017.

»   d&amp;a increased $31.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the bureau van dijk acquisition.

$348.2 million compared to 2016, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 47.6% compared to 45.9% in the prior year.

»   the decrease in non-operating expense, net, compared to the prior year is primarily due to:

»   the $59.7 million ccxi gain in 2017;

»   the $111.1 million purchase price hedge gain in 2017;

partially offset by:
»   higher interest expense of $51.2 million primarily reflecting additional financing in 2017 utilized to fund the payment of the 2016 settlement charge, repay the series 2007-1 notes and fund the bureau van dijk acquisition; and

»   fx losses of approximately $17 million in the 2017 compared to fx gains of approximately $50 million in the prior year. the fx gains in 2016 included approximately $35 million related to the liquidation of a non-u.s. subsidiary.

global revenue of $4,204.1 million in 2017 increased $599.9 million, or 17%, compared to 2016 and reflected strong growth in both mis and ma.
the $403.0 million increase in mis revenue primarily reflects strong global leveraged finance rated issuance volumes in cfg as issuers took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance obligations in 2017 as well as growth in the banking sector within fig and in clo issuance in sfg. additionally, the increase over prior year reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. these increases were partially offset by lower u.s. public finance refunding volumes.
moodys 2018 10-k   45
the $196.9 million increase in ma revenue primarily reflects higher rd&a revenue across all regions driven by growth in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as the contribution from the bureau van dijk acquisition of approximately $92 million (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in note 8 to the financial statements).
transaction revenue accounted for 50% of global mco revenue in 2017 compared to 49% in 2016.
u.s. revenue of $2,348.4 million in 2017 increased $242.9 million over the prior year, reflecting growth in both reportable segments.
non-u.s. revenue increased $357.0 million from 2016 reflecting growth in both reportable segments.
operating expenses were $1,216.6 million in 2017, up $197.0 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance-based expenses (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation), which is correlated with the strong financial performance of the company in 2017. this increase also reflects higher salaries and employee benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and increases in headcount coupled with bureau van dijk expenses.
sg&a expenses of $985.9 million in 2017 increased $54.7 million from the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based correlated costs (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation), which is consistent with the strong financial performance of the company in 2017 coupled with bureau van dijk expenses. these increases were partially offset by the impact of cost management initiatives implemented in 2016 that have benefited 2017 as well as lower legal costs.
d&a increased $31.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the bureau van dijk acquisition.
acquisition-related expenses represent expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk.
operating income of $1,820.8 million increased $1,169.9 million from 2016. operating margin was 43.3% compared to 18.1% in 2016. operating income and operating margin in 2016 were suppressed by the $863.8 million settlement charge. adjusted operating income was $2,001.6 million in 2017, an increase of $348.2 million compared to 2016. adjusted operating margin of 47.6% increased 170 bps compared to the prior year.
interest (expense) income, net in 2017 was $(208.5) million, a $51.2 million increase in expense compared to 2016 primarily due to: i) interest on the 2017 senior notes and 2017 floating rate senior notes which were issued in the first quarter of 2017 to fund the payment of the 2016 settlement charge and repayment of the series 2007-1 notes; ii) interest on the 2017 private placement notes due 2023 and 2028 both issued in june 2017 coupled with interest on the 2017 term loan drawn down in august 2017, all of which were issued to fund the acquisition of bureau van dijk; and iii) fees on the undrawn 2017 bridge credit facility also related to the acquisition of bureau van dijk.
other non-operating (expense) income, net was $3.7 million in 2017, a $60.7 million change compared to 2016 primarily reflecting approximately $17 million in fx losses in 2017 compared to approximately $50 million in fx gains in the prior year. the fx gains in 2016 included an approximate $35 million gain related to the liquidation of a non-u.s. subsidiary.
additionally, moodys recognized the $59.7 million ccxi gain and the $111.1 million purchase price hedge gain in 2017.
the etr of 43.6% in 2017 includes a net charge of approximately $246 million in the fourth quarter related to the impacts of corporate tax reform in the u.s. and belgium partially offset by the non-taxable ccxi gain and an approximate $40 million benefit reflecting the adoption on a prospective basis of a new accounting standard relating to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. in accordance with a new accounting standard, these excess tax benefits are now recorded to the provision for income taxes, whereas in the prior year were recorded to capital surplus (refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this new accounting standard). the 2016 etr of 50.6% included the non-deductible nature of the federal portion of the settlement charge. the impact of the aforementioned tax reform in the u.s. is expected to reduce the companys etr in years subsequent to 2017. for the full-year ended december 31, 2018, the company expects the etr to be between 22% and 23%.
full year 2017 diluted eps of $5.15 was up from $1.36 in 2016. adjusted diluted eps of $6.07 was up 23% from $4.94 in 2016. refer to the section entitled non-gaap financial measures of this md&a for a full list of items excluded in the derivation of adjusted diluted eps.

the following is a discussion of external mis revenue and operating expenses:
global mis revenue of $2,773.8 million in 2017 was up 17% compared to 2016, most notably from strong leveraged finance rated issuance volumes within cfg coupled with strong growth in banking-related revenue in fig and increases across most asset classes in sfg. also contributing to the growth was the favorable impact of changes in product mix, new fee initiatives and pricing increases.
transaction revenue for mis was 65% in 2017 compared to 61% in 2016.
in the u.s., revenue was $1,702.8 million in 2017, an increase of $200.9 million or 13%, compared to 2016 primarily reflecting strong growth in cfg, sfg and fig revenue being partially offset by declines in ppif and mis other revenue.
non-u.s. revenue was $1,071.0 million in 2017, an increase of $202.1 million or 23%, compared to 2016 reflecting growth across all lobs excluding mis other.
global cfg revenue of $1,392.7 million in 2017 was up 24% compared to 2016 primarily due to strength in leveraged finance issuance in the u.s., emea and asia-pacific as issuers took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance obligations and fund m&a activity. the growth in leveraged finance revenue also reflects benefits from a favorable product mix in 2017 compared to the prior year where issuance volumes included a greater number of lower-yielding jumbo deals. the increase over the prior year also reflects higher investment-grade corporate debt revenue in the u.s. reflecting continued favorable market conditions and benefits from changes in product mix, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as growth in monitoring fees across all regions. transaction revenue represented 73% of total cfg revenue in 2017, compared to 68% in the prior year period. in the u.s., revenue was $909.7 million, or 19% higher compared to the prior year. non-u.s. revenue of $483.0 million increased 34% compared to the prior year.
global sfg revenue of $495.5 million in 2017 increased $58.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2016. in the u.s., revenue of $340.1 million increased $46.8 million over 2016 primarily due to strong growth in clo issuance reflecting an increase in bank loan supply and favorable market conditions which enabled both new securitizations and a surge in refinancing activity. non-u.s. revenue in 2017 of $155.4 million increased $11.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth across most asset classes in the emea region. transaction revenue was 65% of total sfg revenue in 2017 compared to 62% in the prior year.
moodys 2018 10-k   47
global fig revenue of $435.8 million in 2017 increased $66.9 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. in the u.s., revenue of $186.1 million increased $26.0 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher issuance in the banking sector and benefits from changes in product mix, new fee initiatives and price increases. non-u.s. revenue was $249.7 million in 2017, up $40.9 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher banking revenue in emea from opportunistic issuance amidst current favorable market conditions as well as benefits from changes in product mix, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. the non-u.s. growth also reflects strength in banking revenue in the asia-pacific region reflecting higher cross-border issuance from chinese banks and the non-bank financial sector. transaction revenue was 45% of total fig revenue in 2017 compared to 37% in 2016.
global ppif revenue was $431.3 million in 2017 and increased $19.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2016. in the u.s., revenue in 2017 was $266.4 million and decreased $9.8 million compared to 2016 primarily due to strong pfg refunding volumes in 2016. these decreases were partially offset by growth in infrastructure finance revenue coupled with benefits from changes in product mix, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. outside the u.s., ppif revenue was $164.9 million and increased $28.9 million compared to 2016 reflecting strong growth in infrastructure finance revenue in the asia-pacific region and growth in public finance revenue in emea. transaction revenue was 65% of total ppif revenue in 2017 compared to 63% in the prior year.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2017 increased $129.0 million compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in performance-based compensation resulting from strong financial performance in 2017 coupled with increased headcount and higher salaries and employee benefits costs reflecting annual compensation increases. these increases were partially offset by lower legal fees and continued cost control initiatives.
adjusted operating income and operating income in 2017, which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses, were $1,646.2 million and $1,571.5 million, respectively, and increased $283.0 million and $1,156.1 million, respectively, compared to 2016. adjusted operating margin was 57.1% or 190 bps higher than the prior year. operating margin was 54.5% in 2017 compared to 16.8% in the prior year. operating income and operating margin in 2016 were suppressed due to the settlement charge.

the following is a discussion of external ma revenue and operating expenses:
global ma revenue increased $196.9 million, or 16%, compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in rd&a (which included approximately $92 million in revenue, or 7 percentage points of the growth, from the bureau van dijk acquisition) coupled with growth in ers, which included revenue from the first quarter 2016 acquisition of ggy. additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from higher fees within mas recurring revenue base due to enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters. recurring revenue comprised 78% and 75% of total ma revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
48   moodys 2018 10-k in the u.s., revenue of $645.6 million in 2017 increased $42.0 million, and reflected growth across all lobs.
non-u.s. revenue of $784.7 million in 2017 was $154.9 million higher than in 2016 reflecting growth in rd&a, which included approximately $82 million in non-u.s. bureau van dijk revenue, and higher ers revenue.
global rd&a revenue of $832.7 million, which comprised 58% and 54% of total external ma revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively, increased $165.1 million, or 25%, over the prior year period. in the u.s., revenue of $424.4 million increased $35.1 million compared to 2016. non-u.s. revenue of $408.3 million increased $130.0 million compared to the prior year. rd&a revenue in 2017 included approximately $92 million in revenue, or 14 percentage points of the growth, from the bureau van dijk acquisition (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in note 7 to the financial statements). rd&a revenue growth also reflects strong results in the credit research and rating data feeds product lines, where enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters have generated higher fees.
global ers revenue of $448.6 million in 2017 increased $29.8 million, or 7%, over 2016. the growth is primarily due to higher revenue from risk and finance analytics products coupled with incremental revenue from ggy, which was acquired in march 2016. additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing increases within erss recurring revenue base. revenue in ers is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. in the u.s., revenue of $166.6 million increased $3.7 million compared to the prior year. non-u.s. revenue of $282.0 million increased $26.1 million compared to the prior year.
global ps revenue of $149.0 million in 2017 increased 1% compared to 2016 reflecting higher revenue from analytical and research services in the u.s. mostly offset by lower revenue from these services internationally. in the u.s., revenue in 2017 was $54.6 million, up 6% compared to 2016. non-u.s. revenue was $94.4 million, down 1% compared to 2016.
operating and sg&a expenses in 2017 increased $122.7 million compared to 2016. the expense growth includes an approximate $74 million increase in compensation costs reflecting $32 million in bureau van dijk compensation costs coupled with annual salary increases, higher performance-based compensation and higher severance costs partially offset by the impact of cost control initiatives. non-compensation costs increased approximately $49 million primarily due to bureau van dijk expenses.
there were $22.5 million in acquisition-related expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk.
depreciation and amortization increased $30.7 million primarily due to the amortization of bureau van dijks intangible assets.
adjusted operating income was $355.4 million in 2017 and increased $65.2 million compared to the same period in 2016. operating income of $249.3 million in 2017 increased $13.8 million compared to the same period in 2016. adjusted operating margin in 2017 was 24.6%, up 130bps from 2016. operating margin was 17.2% in 2017, down 170bps from the prior year reflecting the aforementioned $22.5 million in bureau van dijk acquisition-related expenses coupled with approximately $31 million of higher d&a primarily relating to bureau van dijks intangible assets. adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.
market risk foreign exchange risk:
moodys maintains a presence in 42 countries. in 2018, approximately 43% of both the companys revenue and expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, principally in the british pound and the euro. as such, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 71% of moodys assets were located outside the u.s., making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates. the effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-u.s. operations with non-u.s. functional currencies to the u.s. dollar are charged or credited to oci.
the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the companys consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency. the following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies strengthened against the u.s. dollar:

moodys 2018 10-k   49
the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency.
euro-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges:
the company has designated 500 million of the 2015 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. if the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $57 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to this net investment hedge. this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the companys euro net investment in subsidiaries.
during 2018, the company entered into cross-currency swaps to exchange an aggregate amount of 710.2 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3-month euribor for an aggregate amount of $830.0 million with corresponding interest based on the floating 3-month u.s. libor, which were designated as net investment hedges under asc topic 815, derivatives and hedging. the purpose of these cross-currency swaps is to mitigate fx exposure related to a portion of the companys euro net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in euro/usd exchange rates. if the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $81 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the cross-currency swaps recognized in oci, which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the companys euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
credit and interest rate risk:
interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge:
the companys interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. moodys uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives. the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed-rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month libor. these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the companys consolidated statement of operations. a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the libor-based swap rate would result in an approximate $36 million change to the fair value of the swap, which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item.
additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10-k.
moodys cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the u.s. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow the company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flows.
the following is a summary of the changes in the companys cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:

as a result of the tax act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to u.s. tax. the company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the u.s. the company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, the company has commenced repatriating a portion of its non-u.s. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. notwithstanding the tax act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the u.s., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.
other material future cash requirements the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2019. cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the companys profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. the company may also borrow from various sources.
the company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred.

management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, moodys did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where moodys is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, moodys is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.

non-gaap financial measures:
in addition to its reported results, moodys has included in this md&a certain adjusted results that the sec defines as non-gaap financial measures. management believes that such non-gaap financial measures, when read in conjunction with the companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the companys performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. these non-gaap measures, as defined by the company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. furthermore, these non-gaap measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company. below are descriptions of the companys non-gaap financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the non-gaap measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure:
adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin:
the company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of moodys. adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization, restructuring, and acquisition-

related expenses. depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. acquisition-related expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of bureau van dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses on an annual basis, which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort. acquisition-related expenses from other acquisitions were not material. management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, and acquisition-related expenses, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the companys operating results from period to period and across companies. the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue.

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps attributable to moodys common shareholders:
the company presents adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on the operating performance of moodys. adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges, the purchase price hedge gain, the ccxi gain, the effects of u.s. tax reform and certain adjustments relating to the companys non-u.s. utps.
the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. also, management believes that excluding acquisition-related amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. additionally acquisition-related expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses on an annual basis, which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort relating to bureau van dijk. acquisition-related expenses from other acquisitions were not material.
the company excludes the purchase price hedge gain, the ccxi gain and restructuring charges to provide additional perspective on the companys operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.
furthermore, u.s. tax reform as well as changes in tax laws in europe were both enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in significant adjustments to the provision for income taxes. the company excludes these adjustments as well as the impact of 2018 adjustments pursuant to u.s. tax reform and certain adjustments relating to the companys non-u.s. utps, which resulted in significant adjustments to the provision for income taxes in 2018. the company excludes these items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis executive overview
2018 versus 2017. we generated net earnings of $10.46 billion for 2018, significantly higher compared with $4.29 billion for 2017. diluted earnings per common share was $25.27 for 2018, significantly higher compared with $9.01 for 2017. return on average common shareholders equity (roe) was 13.3% for 2018, compared with 4.9% for 2017. book value per common share was $207.36 as of december 2018, 14.6% higher compared with december 2017.
in 2018, we recorded a $487 million income tax benefit as we finalized the estimated income tax expense of $4.40 billion related to the tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. excluding these items, diluted earnings per common share was $24.02 for 2018, compared with $19.76 for 2017, and roe was 12.7% for 2018, compared with 10.8% for 2017. see results of operations  financial overview for further information about non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of tax legislation. see results of operations  provision for taxes for further information about tax legislation.
net revenues were $36.62 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017, reflecting higher net revenues across all segments. net revenues in institutional client services were higher, due to higher net revenues in both equities and fixed income, currency and commodities client execution (ficc client execution). net revenues in investing & lending increased, driven by significantly higher net interest income in debt securities and loans. net revenues were also higher in investment management, primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees, and investment banking, reflecting strong net revenues in both financial advisory and underwriting during 2018.
provision for credit losses was $674 million for 2018, compared with $657 million for 2017, as the higher provision for credit losses primarily related to consumer loan growth in 2018 was partially offset by an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan in 2017.
operating expenses were $23.46 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting improved operating performance, and significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.
we returned $4.52 billion of capital to common shareholders during 2018, including $3.29 billion of common share repurchases and $1.23 billion in common stock dividends. as of december 2018, our common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio as calculated in accordance with the standardized approach was 13.3% and the basel iii advanced approach was 13.1%. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.
2017 versus 2016. we generated net earnings of $4.29 billion for 2017, a decrease of 42%, compared with $7.40 billion in 2016. diluted earnings per common share was $9.01 for 2017, a decrease of 45%, compared with $16.29 for 2016. roe was 4.9% for 2017, compared with 9.4% for 2016. book value per common share was $181.00 as of december 2017, 0.8% lower compared with december 2016.
net revenues were $32.73 billion for 2017, 6% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher net revenues in investing & lending and higher net revenues in both investment banking and investment management. these increases were partially offset by lower net revenues in institutional client services, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in ficc client execution.
provision for credit losses was $657 million for 2017, compared with $182 million for 2016, reflecting an increase in impairments, which included an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan in 2017, and higher provision for credit losses primarily related to consumer loan growth.
operating expenses were $20.94 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, primarily driven by slightly higher compensation and benefits expenses and our investments to fund growth.
we returned $7.90 billion of capital to common shareholders during 2017, including $6.72 billion of common share repurchases and $1.18 billion in common stock dividends. as of december 2017, our cet1 ratio as calculated in accordance with the standardized approach was 12.1% and the basel iii advanced approach was 10.9%, in each case reflecting the applicable transitional provisions. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.
46   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis business environment global during 2018, real gross domestic product (gdp) growth appeared to increase in the u.s. but generally decreased in other major economies. in advanced economies, growth in the euro area, u.k., and japan each was lower and, in emerging markets, growth in china decreased slightly. economic activity in several major emerging market economies was impacted by concerns about the vulnerability of these economies to a stronger u.s. dollar and higher u.s. treasury rates. global asset markets experienced significant periods of volatility in the first and fourth quarters of 2018 driven by concerns about the prospect of slowing global growth and tighter monetary policy. the u.s. presidential administration implemented and proposed new tariffs on imports from china, which prompted retaliatory measures, and rising global trade tensions remained a meaningful source of uncertainty affecting asset prices throughout 2018. political uncertainty in europe increased as a new coalition government formed in italy in may 2018 and the future of the relationship between the u.k. and e.u. remained uncertain. during 2018, the u.s. federal reserve increased the target federal funds rate four times and the bank of england increased its official target interest rate in august 2018, while the bank of japan introduced forward guidance and expanded the permissible range of fluctuations for the 10-year interest rate.
in investment banking, industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2017, while industry-wide underwriting transactions decreased.
united states in the u.s., real gdp appeared to increase by 2.9% in 2018, compared with 2.2% in 2017, as growth in total fixed investment and government spending increased. measures of consumer confidence were stronger on average compared with the prior year, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.9% as of december 2018. housing starts, sales and prices increased compared with 2017. measures of headline inflation were stable compared with 2017, while measures of core inflation (excluding food and energy) increased. the u.s. federal reserve increased the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in each quarter of 2018 to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of december 2018. the yield on the 10-year u.s. treasury note ended the year at 2.69%, 29 basis points higher compared with the end of 2017. the price of crude oil (wti) ended the year at approximately $45 per barrel, a decrease of 25% compared with the end of 2017. in equity markets, the dow jones industrial average decreased by 6%, the s&p 500 index decreased by 6% and the nasdaq composite index decreased by 4% compared with the end of 2017.
europe in the euro area, real gdp increased by 1.8% in 2018, compared with 2.4% in 2017, while measures of inflation remained low. the european central bank maintained its main refinancing operations rate at 0% and its deposit rate at (0.40)%, but reduced its monthly asset purchases to a pace of 15 billion per month after september 2018 and through december 2018, after which net asset purchases ended. measures of unemployment decreased, and the euro depreciated by 4% against the u.s. dollar compared with the end of 2017. following the formation of a new coalition government in may 2018, political uncertainty in italy remained high and the yield on 10-year government bonds in italy increased significantly. elsewhere in the euro area, yields on 10-year government bonds mostly decreased. in equity markets, the dax index decreased by 18%, the euro stoxx 50 index decreased by 14% and the cac 40 index decreased by 11% compared with the end of 2017. in march 2018, it was announced that terms were agreed upon for the transitional period of the u.k.s withdrawal from the e.u. and, in november 2018, the u.k. and the e.u. agreed on a draft brexit withdrawal agreement. however, as of the end of the year, there was significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the u.k. and the e.u.
in the u.k., real gdp increased by 1.4% in 2018, compared with 1.8% in 2017. the bank of england increased its official bank rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% in august 2018, and the british pound depreciated by 6% against the u.s. dollar. the yield on 10-year government bonds increased by 8 basis points and, in equity markets, the ftse 100 index decreased by 12% compared with the end of 2017.
asia in japan, real gdp increased by 0.7% in 2018, compared with 1.9% in 2017. the bank of japan maintained its asset purchase program and continued to target a yield on 10-year government bonds of approximately 0%. in july 2018, the bank of japan introduced forward guidance for its interest rate policy and expanded the permissible range of deviations from the 0% target yield for the 10-year government bond. the yield on 10-year government bonds decreased by 3 basis points, the u.s. dollar depreciated by 3% against the japanese yen and the nikkei 225 index decreased by 12% compared with the end of 2017.
in china, real gdp increased by 6.6% in 2018, compared with 6.8% in 2017. the u.s. dollar appreciated by 6% against the chinese yuan compared with the end of 2017, while in equity markets, the shanghai composite index decreased by 25% and the hang seng index decreased by 14%.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis in india, real gdp appeared to increase by 7.5% in 2018, compared with 6.3% in 2017. the u.s. dollar appreciated by 9% against the indian rupee and the bse sensex index increased by 6% compared with the end of 2017.
other markets in brazil, real gdp appeared to increase by 1.2% in 2018, compared with 1.1% in 2017. the u.s. dollar appreciated by 17% against the brazilian real and the bovespa index increased by 15% compared with the end of 2017. in russia, real gdp appeared to increase by 2.3% in 2018, compared with 1.5% in 2017. the u.s. dollar appreciated by 21% against the russian ruble and the moex russia index increased by 12% compared with the end of 2017.
critical accounting policies fair value fair value hierarchy. financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (i.e., inventory), and certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, are included in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). in determining fair value, the hierarchy under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). in evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolios net risk exposure to that input. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.
the fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.
instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. level 3 financial assets represented 2.4% as of december 2018 and 2.1% as of december 2017, of our total assets. see notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. these judgments include:
   determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;

   determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and

   determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.

regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.
controls over valuation of financial instruments. market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. in the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. this independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.
48   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis price verification. all financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:
                     trade comparison. analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.

                                                                                              external price comparison. valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, markit, bloomberg, idc, trace). data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. when broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.

                    calibration to market comparables. market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.

                                                             relative value analyses. market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.

       collateral analyses. margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.

                execution of trades. where appropriate, trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.

   backtesting. valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.

see notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.
review of net revenues. independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.
review of valuation models. our independent model risk management group (model risk management), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. new or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use. models are evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. see risk management  model risk management for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill. goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.
goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. when assessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factors are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. if the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated carrying value.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, we assessed goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units by performing a qualitative assessment. the qualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, performance indicators, firm and industry events, macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. based on our evaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. therefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our goodwill.
estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and attributed equity. there is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. the estimated net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. see equity capital management and regulatory capital for further information about our capital requirements.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis if we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.
identifiable intangible assets. we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
a prolonged or severe period of market weakness, or significant changes in regulation, could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets. in addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including weaker business performance resulting in a decrease in our customer base and decreases in revenues from customer contracts and relationships. management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required.
an impairment, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the total of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our identifiable intangible assets.
recent accounting developments see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about recent accounting developments.
use of estimates u.s. gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the allowance for credit losses on loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits.
we estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment. managements estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.
we also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. in addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. see notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings.
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.
in accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.
results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. the composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in u.s. and global economic and market conditions. see risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

operating environment. during 2018, our market-making activities reflected generally higher levels of volatility and improved client activity, compared with a low volatility environment in 2017. in investment banking, industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2017, while industry-wide underwriting transactions decreased. our other principal transactions revenues benefited from company-specific events, including sales, and strong corporate performance, while investments in public equities reflected losses, as global equity prices generally decreased in 2018, particularly towards the end of the year. in investment management, our assets under supervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products, fixed income assets and equity assets, partially offset by depreciation in client assets, primarily in equity assets.
if market-making or investment banking activity levels decline, or assets under supervision decline, or asset prices continue to decline, net revenues would likely be negatively impacted. see segment operating results for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.
during 2017, generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities, investment management performance and other principal transactions. however, low levels of volatility in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities.
2018 versus 2017
net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $36.62 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017, primarily due to significantly higher market making revenues and net interest income, as well as higher investment management revenues and investment banking revenues.
non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.86 billion for 2018, 7% higher than 2017. revenues in financial advisory were higher, reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes. revenues in underwriting were slightly higher, due to significantly higher revenues in equity underwriting, driven by initial public offerings, partially offset by lower revenues in debt underwriting, reflecting a decline in leveraged finance activity.
investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.51 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017, primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees, as a result of harvesting. management and other fees were also higher, reflecting higher average assets under supervision and the impact of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard, partially offset by shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606).
52   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.20 billion for 2018, 5% higher than 2017, reflecting an increase in our listed cash equity and futures volumes, generally consistent with market volumes.
market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.45 billion for 2018, 23% higher than 2017, due to significantly higher revenues in equity products, interest rate products and commodities. these increases were partially offset by significantly lower results in mortgages and lower revenues in credit products.
other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.82 billion for 2018, 2% lower than 2017, reflecting net losses from investments in public equities compared with net gains in the prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events, including sales, and corporate performance.
net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.77 billion for 2018, 28% higher than 2017, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, increases in total average loans receivable and financial instruments owned, and higher yields on financial instruments owned and loans receivable. the increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, deposits and long-term borrowings, and increases in total average long-term borrowings and deposits. see statistical disclosures  distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders equity for further information about our sources of net interest income.
2017 versus 2016
net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $32.73 billion for 2017, 6% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, and higher investment banking revenues, investment management revenues and net interest income. these increases were partially offset by significantly lower market making revenues and lower commissions and fees.
non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.37 billion for 2017, 18% higher than 2016. revenues in financial advisory were higher compared with 2016, reflecting an increase in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. revenues in underwriting were significantly higher compared with 2016, due to significantly higher revenues in both debt underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide leveraged finance activity, and equity underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide secondary offerings.
investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.80 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues.
commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.05 billion for 2017, 5% lower than 2016, reflecting a decline in our listed cash equity volumes in the u.s. market volumes in the u.s. also declined.
market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.66 billion for 2017, 23% lower than 2016, due to significantly lower revenues in commodities, currencies, credit products, interest rate products and equity derivative products. these results were partially offset by significantly higher revenues in equity cash products and significantly improved results in mortgages.
other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.91 billion for 2017, 75% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities, which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance. in addition, net gains from public equities were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year.
net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.93 billion for 2017, 13% higher than 2016, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements, higher interest income from loans receivable due to higher yields and an increase in total average loans receivable, an increase in total average financial instruments owned, and the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks. the increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, an increase in total average long-term borrowings, and the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and collateralized financings. see statistical disclosures  distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders equity for further information about our sources of net interest income.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis
2018 versus 2017. provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $674 million for 2018, compared with $657 million for 2017, as the higher provision for credit losses primarily related to consumer loan growth in 2018 was partially offset by an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan in 2017.
2017 versus 2016. provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $657 million for 2017, compared with $182 million for 2016, reflecting an increase in impairments, which included an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan in 2017, and higher provision for credit losses primarily related to consumer loan growth.
operating expenses our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. compensation and benefits includes salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. in addition, see use of estimates for further information about expenses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings.

2018 versus 2017. operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $23.46 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017. our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2018 was 64.1%, compared with 64.0% for 2017.
the increase in operating expenses compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting improved operating performance, and significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees were also higher, reflecting an increase in activity levels, and technology expenses increased, reflecting higher expenses related to computing services. in addition, expenses related to consolidated investments and our digital lending and deposit platform increased, with the increases primarily in depreciation and amortization expenses, market development expenses and other expenses. the increase compared with 2017 also included $297 million related to the recently adopted revenue recognition standard. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606).
net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2018 were $844 million compared with $188 million for 2017. 2018 included a $132 million charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives, our donor-advised fund. compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives. we ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.
as of december 2018, headcount increased 9% compared with december 2017, reflecting an increase in technology professionals and investments in new business initiatives.
2017 versus 2016. operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $20.94 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016. our efficiency ratio for 2017 was 64.0% compared with 65.9% for 2016.
the increase in operating expenses compared with 2016 was primarily driven by slightly higher compensation and benefits expenses and our investments to fund growth. higher expenses related to consolidated investments and our digital lending and deposit platform were primarily included in depreciation and amortization expenses, market development expenses and other expenses. in addition, technology expenses increased, reflecting higher expenses related to cloud-based services and software depreciation, and professional fees increased, primarily related to consulting costs. these increases were partially offset by lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and lower occupancy expenses (primarily related to exit costs in 2016).
54   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2017 were $188 million compared with $396 million for 2016. 2017 included a $127 million charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives, our donor-advised fund. compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives. we ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.
as of december 2017, headcount increased 4% compared with december 2016, reflecting an increase in employees of our digital lending and deposit platform, and in support of our regulatory efforts.
provision for taxes the effective income tax rate for 2018 was 16.2%, down from 61.5% for 2017, as 2017 included the estimated impact of tax legislation, which increased our effective income tax rate by 39.5 percentage points. additionally, the decrease compared with 2017 reflected the impact of the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate in 2018. the estimated impact of tax legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $4.40 billion for 2017. during 2018, we finalized this estimate to reflect the impact of updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by the irs, resulting in a $487 million income tax benefit for 2018.
the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 61.5%, up from 28.2% for 2016. the increase compared with 2016 was primarily due to the estimated impact of tax legislation, which was enacted on december 22, 2017, partially offset by tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards in accordance with asu no. 2016-09.
effective january 1, 2018, tax legislation reduced the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21%, eliminated tax deductions for certain expenses and enacted two new taxes, base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) and global intangible low taxed income (gilti). beat is an alternative minimum tax that applies to banks that pay more than 2% of total deductible expenses to certain foreign subsidiaries. gilti is effectively a 10.5% tax, before allowable credits for foreign taxes paid, on the annual taxable income of certain foreign subsidiaries. income tax expense associated with gilti is recognized as incurred. during 2018, the irs issued proposed regulations relating to beat and gilti. our 2018 effective income tax rate includes estimates for beat and gilti that are based on our current interpretation of these proposed regulations. we do not expect that the finalization of these proposed regulations will have a material impact on these estimates.
based on our current interpretations of the rules and legislative guidance to date, we expect our 2019 tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation.

operating environment. during 2018, industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions activity was strong and volumes increased compared with 2017.
in underwriting, industry-wide equity and debt underwriting transactions decreased compared with 2017, reflecting a challenging market environment for financing towards the end of 2018. however, demand for initial public offerings increased compared with 2017.
in the future, if industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes decline, or if equity or debt underwriting transactions continue to decline, net revenues in investment banking would likely be negatively impacted.
during 2017, investment banking operated in an environment characterized by solid industry-wide mergers and acquisitions transactions, although volumes declined compared with 2016. industry-wide debt underwriting offerings remained strong and industry-wide equity underwriting offerings increased significantly compared with 2016.
2018 versus 2017. net revenues in investment banking were $7.86 billion for 2018, 7% higher than 2017.
net revenues in financial advisory were $3.51 billion, 10% higher than 2017, reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes.
net revenues in underwriting were $4.36 billion, 4% higher than 2017, due to significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting, driven by initial public offerings, partially offset by lower net revenues in debt underwriting, reflecting a decline in leveraged finance activity.
operating expenses were $4.35 billion for 2018, 23% higher than 2017, primarily due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues, and the impact of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard. pre-tax earnings were $3.52 billion in 2018, 9% lower than 2017. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606).
as of december 2018, our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with december 2017, primarily due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions. estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions were also higher, while estimated net revenues from equity underwriting transactions were essentially unchanged.
56   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. we believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. however, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave within the same reporting period. in addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.
2017 versus 2016. net revenues in investment banking were $7.37 billion for 2017, 18% higher than 2016.
net revenues in financial advisory were $3.19 billion, 9% higher than 2016, reflecting an increase in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.
net revenues in underwriting were $4.18 billion, 25% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher net revenues in both debt underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide leveraged finance activity, and equity underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide secondary offerings.
operating expenses were $3.53 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $3.85 billion in 2017, 36% higher than 2016.
as of december 2017, our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with december 2016, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions and significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily in initial public offerings. these increases were partially offset by lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions, principally related to mergers and acquisitions.
institutional client services our institutional client services segment consists of:
ficc client execution. includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments for interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities.
                                                                                   interest rate products. government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.

                                                          credit products. investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds, bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.

                                                                                               mortgages. commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including u.s. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.

      currencies. currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on g-10 currencies and emerging-market products.

                                                            commodities. commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.

equities. includes client execution activities related to making markets in equity products and commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as otc transactions. equities also includes our securities services business, which provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis market-making activities as a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. in this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). in addition, we maintain inventory, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. we also hold inventory to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities. our market-making inventory is recorded in financial instruments owned (long positions) or financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (short positions) in our consolidated statements of financial condition.
our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.
the amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.
in general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. however, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. for example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) wider credit spreads on our inventory positions.

58   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis operating environment. during 2018, institutional client services operated in an environment characterized by generally higher levels of volatility and improved client activity, compared with a low volatility environment in 2017. the average daily vix for 2018 increased to 17, reflecting periods of high volatility in the first and fourth quarters of 2018, compared with 11 for 2017. in 2018, global equity markets generally decreased (with the msci world index down 11%) and in credit markets, spreads generally widened (with u.s. high-yield credit spreads wider by 139 basis points), both particularly towards the end of the year. oil prices decreased to $45 per barrel (wti), while natural gas prices were essentially unchanged at $2.94 per million british thermal units compared to the end of 2017. if activity levels decline, net revenues in institutional client services would likely be negatively impacted. see business environment for further information about economic and market conditions in the global operating environment during the year.
during 2017, low volatility levels in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets impacted the operating environment for institutional client services. this negatively affected client activity across businesses, particularly in ficc client execution. although market-making conditions were challenged, global equity markets increased compared with 2016, and credit spreads generally tightened.
2018 versus 2017. net revenues in institutional client services were $13.48 billion for 2018, 13% higher than 2017.
net revenues in ficc client execution were $5.88 billion, 11% higher than 2017, primarily reflecting higher client activity.
the following provides information about our ficc client execution net revenues by business, compared with 2017 results:
   net revenues in commodities were significantly higher, reflecting the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory, compared with challenging conditions in 2017, and higher client activity.

   net revenues in currencies were significantly higher, primarily reflecting higher client activity.

   net revenues in interest rate products and mortgages were both slightly lower, reflecting lower client activity.

   net revenues in credit products were essentially unchanged, reflecting the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2018, offset by higher client activity.

for 2018, approximately 90% of the net revenues in ficc client execution were generated from market intermediation and approximately 10% were generated from financing. ficc client execution financing net revenues include net revenues primarily from short-term repurchase agreement activities.
net revenues in equities were $7.60 billion, 15% higher than 2017, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both cash products and derivatives. in addition, commissions and fees were higher, reflecting an increase in our listed cash equity and futures volumes, generally consistent with market volumes. net revenues in securities services were slightly higher.
for 2018, approximately 60% of the net revenues in equities were generated from market intermediation and approximately 40% were generated from financing. equities financing net revenues include net revenues from prime brokerage and other financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps.
operating expenses were $10.35 billion for 2018, 7% higher than 2017, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues, higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. pre-tax earnings were $3.13 billion in 2018, 42% higher than 2017.
2017 versus 2016. net revenues in institutional client services were $11.90 billion for 2017, 18% lower than 2016.
net revenues in ficc client execution were $5.30 billion, 30% lower than 2016, reflecting significantly lower client activity. approximately one-third of the decline in ficc client execution net revenues was due to significantly lower results in commodities.
the following provides information about our ficc client execution net revenues by business, compared with 2016 results:
   net revenues in commodities were significantly lower, reflecting the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.

   net revenues in interest rate products were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity.

   net revenues in currencies were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity and the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.

   net revenues in credit products were significantly lower, reflecting lower client activity.

   net revenues in mortgages were significantly higher, reflecting the impact of favorable market-making conditions on our inventory, including generally tighter spreads, compared with a challenging 2016.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $6.60 billion, 4% lower than 2016, primarily due to lower commissions and fees, reflecting a decline in our listed cash equity volumes in the u.s. market volumes in the u.s. also declined. in addition, net revenues in equities client execution were lower, reflecting lower net revenues in derivatives, partially offset by higher net revenues in cash products. net revenues in securities services were essentially unchanged.
operating expenses were $9.69 billion for 2017, essentially unchanged compared with 2016, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues, largely offset by increased technology expenses, reflecting higher expenses related to cloud-based services and software depreciation, and increased consulting costs. pre-tax earnings were $2.21 billion in 2017, 54% lower than 2016.   investing & lending investing & lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans, including our relationship lending activities, to provide financing to clients. these investments and loans are typically longer-term in nature. we make investments, some of which are consolidated, including through our merchant banking business and our special situations group, in debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure and real estate entities. some of these investments are made indirectly through funds that we manage. we also make unsecured loans through our digital platform, marcus: by goldman sachs and secured loans through our digital platform, goldman sachs private bank select.

earnings operating environment. during 2018, our investments in private equities benefited from company-specific events, including sales, and strong corporate performance, while investments in public equities reflected losses, as global equity prices generally decreased. results for our investments in debt securities and loans reflected continued growth in loans receivables, resulting in higher net interest income. if macroeconomic concerns negatively affect corporate performance or the origination of loans, or if global equity prices continue to decline, net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted.
during 2017, generally higher global equity prices and tighter credit spreads contributed to a favorable environment for our equity and debt investments. results also reflected net gains from company-specific events, including sales, and corporate performance.
2018 versus 2017. net revenues in investing & lending were $8.25 billion for 2018, 14% higher than 2017.
net revenues in equity securities were $4.46 billion, 3% lower than 2017, reflecting net losses from investments in public equities (2018 included $183 million of net losses) compared with net gains in the prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities (2018 included $4.64 billion of net gains), driven by company-specific events, including sales, and corporate performance. for 2018, 60% of the net revenues in equity securities were generated from corporate investments and 40% were generated from real estate.
net revenues in debt securities and loans were $3.80 billion, 43% higher than 2017, primarily driven by significantly higher net interest income. 2018 included net interest income of approximately $2.70 billion compared with approximately $1.80 billion in 2017.
provision for credit losses was $674 million for 2018, compared with $657 million for 2017, as the higher provision for credit losses primarily related to consumer loan growth in 2018 was partially offset by an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan in 2017.
operating expenses were $3.37 billion for 2018, 20% higher than 2017, primarily due to increased expenses related to consolidated investments and our digital lending and deposit platform, and increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $4.21 billion in 2018, 11% higher than 2017.
2017 versus 2016. net revenues in investing & lending were $7.24 billion for 2017, 70% higher than 2016.
net revenues in equity securities were $4.58 billion, 78% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities (2017 included $3.82 billion of net gains), which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance. in addition, net gains from public equities (2017 included $762 million of net gains) were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year. for 2017, 64% of the net revenues in equity securities were generated from corporate investments and 36% were generated from real estate.
net revenues in debt securities and loans were $2.66 billion, 57% higher than 2016, reflecting significantly higher net interest income (2017 included approximately $1.80 billion of net interest income).

operating expenses were $2.80 billion for 2017, 17% higher than 2016, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues, increased expenses related to consolidated investments, and increased expenses related to our digital lending and deposit platform. pre-tax earnings were $3.79 billion in 2017 compared with $1.69 billion in 2016.
investment management investment management provides investment management services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients. investment management also offers wealth advisory services provided by our subsidiary, the ayco company, l.p., including portfolio management and financial planning and counseling, and brokerage and other transaction services to high-net-worth individuals and families.
assets under supervision (aus) include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. this includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets.
assets under supervision typically generate fees as a percentage of net asset value, which vary by asset class, distribution channel and the type of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions. asset classes such as alternative investment and equity assets typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. the average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) we earned on our assets under supervision was 34 basis points for 2018 and 35 basis points for both 2017 and 2016.
in certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds or a separately managed accounts return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets.

operating environment. during 2018, our assets under supervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products, fixed income assets and equity assets. this increase was partially offset by depreciation in our client assets, primarily in equity assets, as global equity prices generally decreased in 2018, particularly towards the end of the year. the mix of our average assets under supervision between long-term assets under supervision and liquidity products during 2018 was essentially unchanged compared with 2017. in the future, if asset prices continue to decline, or investors continue to favor assets that typically generate lower fees or investors withdraw their assets, net revenues in investment management would likely be negatively impacted.
during 2017, investment management operated in an environment characterized by generally higher asset prices, resulting in appreciation in both equity and fixed income assets. our long-term assets under supervision increased from net inflows primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets. these increases were partially offset by net outflows in liquidity products. as a result, the mix of our average assets under supervision during 2017 shifted slightly from liquidity products to long-term assets under supervision compared to the mix at the end of 2016.
2018 versus 2017. net revenues in investment management were $7.02 billion for 2018, 13% higher than 2017, primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees, as a result of harvesting. management and other fees were also higher, reflecting higher average assets under supervision and the impact of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard, partially offset by shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. in addition, transaction revenues were higher. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606).
during 2018, total assets under supervision increased $48 billion to $1.54 trillion. long-term assets under supervision decreased $4 billion, including net market depreciation of $41 billion primarily in equity assets, largely offset by net inflows of $37 billion, primarily in fixed income and equity assets. liquidity products increased $52 billion.
operating expenses were $5.27 billion for 2018, 10% higher than 2017, primarily due to the impact of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard and increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $1.76 billion in 2018, 24% higher than 2017. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606).
2017 versus 2016. net revenues in investment management were $6.22 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues.
during 2017, total assets under supervision increased $115 billion to $1.49 trillion. long-term assets under supervision increased $128 billion, including net market appreciation of $86 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, and net inflows of $42 billion (which includes $20 billion of inflows in connection with the verus acquisition and $5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the australian divestiture), primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets. liquidity products decreased $13 billion (which includes $3 billion of inflows in connection with the verus acquisition).
operating expenses were $4.80 billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $1.42 billion in 2017, 25% higher than 2016.

62   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management one of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. while our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. see equity capital management and regulatory capital  equity capital management for information about our equity capital management process.
although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.
in order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.
balance sheet planning. we prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. this plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. the objectives of this planning process are:
   to develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;

                                             to allow treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and

   to inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.

treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. the specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.
our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the firmwide asset liability committee and the risk governance committee. see risk management  overview and structure of risk management for an overview of our risk management structure.
balance sheet limits. the firmwide asset liability committee and the risk governance committee have the responsibility of reviewing and approving balance sheet limits. these limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. the firmwide asset liability committee and the risk governance committee review and approve balance sheet limits. in addition, the risk governance committee sets aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time. requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.
monitoring of key metrics. we monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. we allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.
scenario analyses. we conduct various scenario analyses including as part of the comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) and dodd-frank act stress tests (dfast), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. see equity capital management and regulatory capital  equity capital management for further information about these scenario analyses. these scenarios cover short-term and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. we use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis balance sheet allocation in addition to preparing our consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with u.s. gaap, we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses, which is a non-gaap presentation and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap presentations used by other companies. we believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with our assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of our assets.

we maintain liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. see risk management  liquidity risk management for information about the composition and sizing of our gcla. we also segregate cash and securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. securities are segregated from our own inventory, as well as from collateral obtained through securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements). in addition, we maintain other unrestricted operating cash balances, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.

                                                                                                secured client financing. we provide collateralized financing for client positions, including margin loans secured by client collateral, securities borrowed, and resale agreements primarily collateralized by government obligations. our secured client financing arrangements, which are generally short-term, are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value, and include daily margin requirements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.

                                                                                                 institutional client services. we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. additionally, as part of market-making activities, we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities or use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. the receivables in institutional client services primarily relate to securities transactions.

equity. we make equity investments in corporate and real estate entities. as of december 2018, 30% of total equity was in investments made in 2011 or earlier, 23% was in investments made during 2012 through 2014, and 47% was in investments made since the beginning of 2015.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis balance sheet analysis and metrics as of december 2018, total assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $931.80 billion, an increase of $15.02 billion from december 2017, reflecting increases in cash and cash equivalents of $20.50 billion, financial instruments owned of $20.17 billion, and loans receivable of $14.66 billion, partially offset by a net decrease in collateralized agreements of $37.13 billion. the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflected the impact of our and clients activities. the increase in financial instruments owned primarily reflected higher client activity in government and agency obligations, partially offset by lower activity in equity securities by us and our clients. the increase in loans receivable primarily reflected an increase in corporate and commercial real estate loans. the net decrease in collateralized agreements reflected the impact of our and clients activities.
as of december 2018, total liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $841.61 billion, an increase of $7.08 billion from december 2017, primarily reflecting increases in deposits of $19.65 billion and unsecured long-term borrowings of $6.46 billion, partially offset by decreases in collateralized financings of $12.34 billion and unsecured short term borrowings of $6.42 billion. the increase in deposits primarily reflected an increase in consumer deposits. the increase in unsecured long-term borrowings was primarily due to net new issuances. the decrease in collateralized financings reflected the impact of our and clients activities. the decrease in unsecured short term borrowings was primarily due to maturities and early retirements.
our total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $78.72 billion as of december 2018 and $84.72 billion as of december 2017, which were 1% higher as of december 2018 and 2% lower as of december 2017 than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 12% lower as of december 2018 and 1% lower as of december 2017 than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. as of december 2018, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the quarter, and decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the year, resulted from client and our activity at the end of the period.
the level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as liquid government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.

our funding is primarily raised in u.s. dollar, euro, british pound and japanese yen. we generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the americas, europe and asia. we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. we have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.
deposits. our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. a growing portion of our deposit base consists of consumer deposits. deposits are primarily used to finance lending activity, other inventory and a portion of our gcla. we raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, through internal and third-party broker-dealers, and from consumers and institutional clients, and primarily through goldman sachs bank usa (gs bank usa) and goldman sachs international bank (gsib). in september 2018, we launched marcus: by goldman sachs in the u.k. to accept deposits. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits.
secured funding. we fund a significant amount of inventory on a secured basis. secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated statements of financial condition. we may also pledge our inventory as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. we also use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. nonetheless, we continually analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty roll over probabilities. we seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding, and pre-funding residual risk through our gcla.
we seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.
the weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated statements of financial condition, excluding funding that can only be collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, exceeded 120 days as of december 2018.
assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. assets that are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. see notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and unsecured long-term borrowings below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding.
we also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. gs bank usa has access to funding from the federal home loan bank. our outstanding borrowings against the federal home loan bank were $528 million as of december 2018 and $3.40 billion as of december 2017.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis gs bank usa also has access to funding through the federal reserve bank discount window. while we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing, we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures.
unsecured short-term borrowings. a significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. we use unsecured short-term borrowings, including u.s. and non-u.s. hybrid financial instruments, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. in light of regulatory developments, group inc. no longer issues debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.
unsecured long-term borrowings. we issue unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding for inventory and other assets and to finance a portion of our gcla. unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated u.s. registered offerings, u.s. registered and rule 144a medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. we issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.

the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of december 2018 was approximately eight years. to mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. we enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.
shareholders equity. shareholders equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders equity.
equity capital management and regulatory capital capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.
equity capital management we determine the appropriate amount and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.
we manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.
we principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. we may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the board of governors of the federal reserve system (frb) does not object to such capital action. see notes 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.
68   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis capital planning and stress testing process. as part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.
the following is a description of our capital planning and stress testing process:
                                                                                               capital planning. our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. we incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.

our capital planning process also includes an internal risk-based capital assessment. this assessment incorporates market risk, credit risk and operational risk. market risk is calculated by using value-at-risk (var) calculations supplemented by risk-based add-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties probability of default and the size of our losses in the event of a default.
operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures, as well as considering internal and external actual loss experience. backtesting for market risk and credit risk is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks.

                                                                                                stress testing. our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under ccar and dfast, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. we provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in business  available information in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.

as required by the frbs annual ccar rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the frb. the purpose of the frbs review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.
the frb evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and stress scenarios provided by the frb and those developed internally. this evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. in addition, the frb evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.
in addition, the dfast rules currently require us to conduct stress tests on a semi-annual basis and publish a summary of results. the frb also conducts its own annual stress tests and publishes a summary of certain results.
with respect to our 2018 ccar submission, the frb informed us that it did not object to our capital plan, conditioned upon us returning not more than $6.30 billion of capital from the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019. the capital plan provides for up to $5.00 billion in repurchases of outstanding common stock and $1.30 billion in total common stock dividends, including an increase in our common stock dividend of $0.05 from $0.80 to $0.85 per share in the second quarter of 2019, subject to the approval by the board of directors of group inc. (board). the amount and timing of our capital actions will be based on, among other things, our current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities. we published a summary of our annual dfast results in june 2018. see business  available information in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
in october 2018, we submitted our semi-annual dfast results to the frb and published a summary of the results of our internally developed severely adverse scenario. see business  available information in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
in addition, gs bank usa submitted its 2018 annual dfast results to the frb in april 2018 and published a summary of its annual dfast results in june 2018. gs bank usa will not be required to conduct the annual company-run stress test in 2019. see business  available information in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
goldman sachs international (gsi) and gsib also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the prudential regulation authoritys (pra) internal capital adequacy assessment process.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis contingency capital plan. as part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. it outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.
capital attribution. we assess each of our businesses capital usage based upon our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. these regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the frbs annual stress test scenarios which include the standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios.
we also attribute risk-weighted assets (rwas) to our business segments. as of december 2018, approximately 60% of rwas calculated in accordance with the standardized capital rules and approximately 50% of rwas calculated in accordance with the basel iii advanced rules, were attributed to our institutional client services segment and substantially all of the remaining rwas were attributed to our investing & lending segment. we manage the levels of our capital usage based upon balance sheet and risk limits, as well as capital return analyses of our businesses based on our capital attribution.
share repurchase program. we use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the frb as part of ccar. the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.
as of december 2018, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 33.7 million shares; however, we are only permitted to make repurchases to the extent that such repurchases have not been objected to by the frb. see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in part ii, item 5 of this form 10-k and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.
resolution capital models. in connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a resolution capital adequacy and positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (gs bank usa, goldman sachs & co. llc (gs&co.), gsi, gsib, goldman sachs japan co., ltd. (gsjcl), goldman sachs asset management, l.p. and goldman sachs asset management international (gsami)) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a group inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.
in addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc.
rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. gs&co. and gsi have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. gs bank usa and gsib have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. in addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc.
the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. see risk management  liquidity risk management  credit ratings for further information about credit ratings of group inc., gs bank usa, gsib, gs&co. and gsi.
70   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis consolidated regulatory capital we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the frb (capital framework). under the capital framework, we are an advanced approach banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank (g-sib).
the capital framework includes risk-based capital buffers that phased in ratably and became fully effective on january 1, 2019. the minimum risk-based capital ratios applicable to us as of january 2019 reflected the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, determined by the frb. in addition, the fully phased-in g-sib buffer applicable to us as of january 2019 is 2.5% based on 2017 financial data. the g-sib buffer applicable to us as of january 2020 is 2.5% based on 2018 financial data. the g-sib and countercyclical buffers in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes.
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the capital framework.
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
bank subsidiaries. gs bank usa is our primary u.s. banking subsidiary and gsib is our primary non-u.s. banking subsidiary. these entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.
u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries. gs&co. is our primary u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority, inc. in addition, gs&co. is a registered futures commission merchant and is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the cftc, the chicago mercantile exchange and the national futures association. rule 15c3-1 of the sec and rule 1.17 of the cftc specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept in relatively liquid form. gs&co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative net capital requirement as permitted by rule 15c3-1.
gs&co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by rule 15c3-1, of $17.45 billion as of december 2018 and $15.57 billion as of december 2017, which exceeded the amount required by $15.00 billion as of december 2018 and $13.15 billion as of december 2017. in addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, gs&co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of appendix e of rule 15c3-1. gs&co. is also required to notify the sec in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. as of both december 2018 and december 2017, gs&co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.
non-u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries. our principal non-u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include gsi and gsjcl.
gsi, our u.k. broker-dealer, is regulated by the pra and the financial conduct authority (fca). gsi is subject to the capital framework for e.u.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the e.u. fourth capital requirements directive and the e.u. capital requirements regulation (crr). these capital regulations are largely based on basel iii.

                           cet1, tier 1 capital and total capital as of december 2018 included amounts which will be finalized upon the issuance of gsis 2018 annual audited financial statements and contributed approximately 114 basis points to the risk-based capital ratios.

                  the minimum risk-based capital ratios incorporate capital guidance received from the pra and could change in the future. gsis future capital requirements may also be impacted by developments such as the introduction of risk-based capital buffers.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis in november 2016, the european commission proposed amendments to the crr to implement a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain e.u. financial institutions. this leverage ratio compares the crrs definition of tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less tier 1 capital deductions. any required minimum leverage ratio is expected to become effective for gsi no earlier than january 1, 2021. gsi had a leverage ratio of 4.4% as of december 2018 and 4.1% as of december 2017. tier 1 capital as of december 2018 included amounts which will be finalized upon the issuance of gsis 2018 annual audited financial statements and these amounts contributed approximately 31 basis points to the leverage ratio. this leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with gsis regulators.
gsjcl, our japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by japans financial services agency. gsjcl and certain other non-u.s. subsidiaries are also subject to capital adequacy requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. as of both december 2018 and december 2017, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital adequacy requirements.
regulatory matters and other developments regulatory matters our businesses are subject to significant and evolving regulation. the dodd-frank act, enacted in july 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. in addition, other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.
see business  regulation in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.
resolution and recovery plans. we are required by the frb and the fdic to submit a periodic plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). we are also required by the frb to submit a periodic recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress.
in december 2017, the frb and the fdic provided feedback on our 2017 resolution plan and determined that it satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in our prior submissions. the frb and the fdic did not identify deficiencies in our 2017 resolution plan, but the frb and the fdic did note one shortcoming that must be addressed in our next resolution plan submission. our next resolution plan is due on july 1, 2019. in december 2018, the frb and fdic finalized guidance for resolution plan submissions which consolidated or superseded all prior guidance. see business  available information in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
in addition, gs bank usa is required to submit periodic resolution plans to the fdic. gs bank usas 2018 resolution plan was submitted on june 28, 2018. in august 2018, the fdic extended the next resolution plan filing deadline to no sooner than july 1, 2020.
tlac. in december 2016, the frb adopted a final rule, establishing new tlac and related requirements for u.s. bhcs designated as g-sibs. the rule became effective in january 2019, with no phase-in period. failure to comply with the tlac requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the frb and could limit our ability to distribute capital, including share repurchases and dividend payments, and to make certain discretionary compensation payments.
the table below presents information about our tlac and external long-term debt ratios.

         tlac includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by group inc. eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements.

   external long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years.

     rwas represent basel iii advanced rwas. in accordance with the tlac rules, the higher of basel iii advanced or standardized rwas are used in the calculation of tlac and external long-term debt ratios.

   leverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance-sheet exposures.

other developments brexit. in march 2017, the u.k. government commenced the formal proceedings to end the u.k.s membership in the e.u. there is a two year window during which the terms of the u.k.s exit from the e.u. may be negotiated. this period expires on march 29, 2019.
the e.u. and the u.k. had negotiated a withdrawal agreement which both the u.k. and the e.u. parliaments must ratify (the withdrawal agreement). the u.k. parliament has not yet approved the withdrawal agreement. as a result, there is a possibility that the u.k. will leave the e.u. on march 29, 2019 without any transitional arrangements in place and firms based in the u.k. will lose their existing access arrangements to the e.u. markets; such a scenario is referred to as a hard brexit.
we have been preparing for anticipated outcomes, including a hard brexit, with the goal of ensuring that we maintain access to e.u. markets and are able to continue to provide products and services to our e.u. clients. in order for us to continue to serve our e.u. clients, clients may need to face an entity within one of the remaining e.u. member states, unless national laws in the applicable member state permit cross-border services from non-e.u. entities (for example, based on specific licenses or exemptions).
our plan to manage a hard brexit scenario involves transition of certain activities to new and/or different legal entities; working with clients and counterparties to redocument transactions so they face one of our e.u. legal entities; changes to our infrastructure; obtaining and developing new real estate; and, in some cases, moving our people to offices in the e.u.
in a hard brexit scenario or as otherwise necessary, our plan is to service our e.u. client base in the following manner:
                                 our german bank subsidiary, goldman sachs bank europe se (gsbe), will act as our main operating subsidiary in the e.u. and will assume certain functions that can no longer be efficiently and effectively performed by our u.k. operating subsidiaries, including gsi, gsib and gsami.

                                    consistent with our global approach of being closer to our clients, we are also setting up branches of gsbe in a number of jurisdictions in the e.u. to enable investment banking, institutional client services and pwm investment personnel to be situated in our offices in those countries.

                                        we have received approval from the german financial regulator, bafin, for a licensed investment firm, goldman sachs europe se, which will be able to conduct certain activities (such as activities related to physical commodities and related products) that gsbe may be prevented from undertaking.

                                                                      in order to service our investment management business, we have received approval from the irish financial regulator, the central bank of ireland, for a collective investment fund and alternative investment fund manager in ireland, to replace the similar existing london-based alternative investment fund manager, which will lose its e.u. passport post-brexit.

                                                                           a large portion of our institutional client services and investment banking clients are classified as professionals or eligible counterparties in specific jurisdictions and may choose to continue being serviced by, and to continue to transact with, the u.k. service providers and entities under domestic arrangements provided by individual member states (licenses or exemptions). we expect to continue providing products and services in this manner to the extent that clients prefer such coverage and it is available. this would mean those clients who choose to do so in certain jurisdictions could continue to face gsi.

   we are also in the process of opening accounts to enable clients to transact with gsbe and/or goldman sachs europe se, as applicable.

                                                                                   the internal infrastructure build-out and external connectivity to financial market infrastructure required for the new e.u. entities continues to progress, with substantial elements already in place. gsbe has connected to settlement and clearing systems and is testing exchange connectivity.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis
                                          gsbe has been assigned a credit rating of a/f1 by fitch, inc. (fitch), a1/p-1 by moodys investors service (moodys) and a+/a-1 by standard &amp; poors ratings services (s&amp;p), which are consistent with those issued to gsi.

   headcount in our e.u. offices has increased over the course of last year, with several hundred roles expected to transition into the e.u. under our current planning assumptions.

   we have secured and are developing additional real estate capacity in frankfurt, stockholm, milan and dublin.

replacement of interbank offered rates (ibors), including libor. central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, u.s., u.k., e.u., switzerland and japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for ibors. the u.k. fca, which regulates libor, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to libor after 2021. the e.u. benchmarks regulation imposed conditions under which only compliant benchmarks may be used in new contracts after 2021.
market-led working groups in major jurisdictions, noted above, have already selected their preferred alternative risk-free reference rates and have published and will continue to publish consultations on issues, including methodologies for fallback provisions in contracts and financial instruments linked to ibors and the development of term structures for alternative risk-free reference rates, which will be critical for financial markets to transition to the use of alternative risk-free reference rates in place of ibors.
we have exposure to ibors, including in financial instruments and contracts that mature after 2021. our exposures arise from securities and loans we hold for investment or in connection with market-making activities, as well as derivatives we enter into to make markets for our clients and hedge our risks. we also have exposure to ibors in the floating-rate securities and other funding products we issue.
the markets for alternative risk-free reference rates are developing and as they develop we expect to transition to these alternative risk-free reference rates.
we are seeking to facilitate an orderly transition from ibors to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients. accordingly, we have created a program that focuses on:
   evaluating and monitoring the impacts across our businesses, including transactions and products;

                                                           identifying and evaluating the scope of existing financial instruments and contracts that may be affected, and the extent to which those financial instruments and contracts already contain appropriate fallback language or would require amendment, either through bilateral negotiation or using industry-wide tools, such as protocols;

   enhancements to infrastructure (for example, models and systems) to prepare for a smooth transition to alternative risk-free reference rates;

   active participation in central bank and sector working groups, including responding to industry consultations; and

   client education and communication.

as part of this program, we have sought to systematically identify the risks inherent in this transition, including financial risks (for example, earnings volatility under stress due to widening swap spreads and the loss of funding sources as a result of counterparties reluctance to participate in transitioning their positions) and nonfinancial risks (for example, the inability to negotiate fallbacks with clients and/or counterparties and operational impediments to the transition). we are engaged with a range of industry and regulatory working groups (for example, isda, the bank of englands working group on sterling risk free reference rates and the federal reserves alternative reference rates committee) and will continue to engage with our clients and counterparties to facilitate an orderly transition to alternative risk-free reference rates.
off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements. our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:
   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;

   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;

   entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps;

   entering into operating leases; and

   providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.

74   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. the securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.
we also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.

risk management risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. for further information about our risk management processes, see overview and structure of risk management. our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. for further information about our areas of risk, see liquidity risk management, market risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management and model risk management and risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.overview and structure of risk management overview we believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. these risks include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risk exposures. our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.
governance. risk management governance starts with the board, which both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. the board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. the risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our strategic business objectives, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements.
the board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from the head of compliance, on legal and regulatory matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our firmwide client and business standards committee and our firmwide reputational risk committee. the chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the risk committee of the board. as part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the risk committee of the board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.
the enterprise risk management department, which reports to our chief risk officer, oversees the implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.
our revenue-producing units, as well as treasury, operations and technology, are our first line of defense and are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.
our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk-oriented committees. independent risk oversight and control functions include compliance, conflicts resolution, controllers, credit risk management, enterprise risk management, human capital management, legal, liquidity risk management, market risk management, model risk management, operational risk management and tax.
76   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis internal audit is considered our third line of defense and reports to our chief executive officer and the audit committee of the board. internal audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. internal audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the audit committee of the board, senior management and regulators.
the three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.
our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. we make extensive use of risk-related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.
we maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. while our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. we regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.
processes. we maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including identifying, assessing, monitoring and limiting our risks.
to effectively assess and monitor our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. we carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. we do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.
we also apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. the board, directly or indirectly through its risk committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. in addition, the firmwide enterprise risk committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the risk committee of the board, at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis.
the risk governance committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. this fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. see liquidity risk management, market risk management, credit risk management and operational risk management for further information.
active management of our positions is another important process. proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress.
effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. as such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems are comprehensive, reliable and timely. we devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information.   people. even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.
we reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. as part of our annual performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis structure ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our board. the board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee. we have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. we have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees or working groups, are described below. in addition to these committees, we have other risk-oriented committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. all of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation.
membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.
the chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure, our three lines of defense and our reporting relationships.
management committee. the management committee oversees our global activities. it provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. this committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. most members of the management committee are also members of other committees. the following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.

                                                                                              firmwide capital committee. the firmwide capital committee provides approval and oversight of debt-related transactions, including principal commitments of our capital. this committee aims to ensure that business, reputational and suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. this committee is co-chaired by the head of credit risk management and a co-head of the financing group, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the firmwide enterprise risk committee.

                                                                                                    firmwide commitments committee. the firmwide commitments committee reviews our underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity-related product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. in addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. this committee is co-chaired by the co-head of the industrials group in our investment banking division, an advisory director and a managing director in risk management, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the firmwide client and business standards committee.

conflicts management conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. the term conflict of interest does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. the responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.
we have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with conflicts resolution, legal and compliance, the firmwide client and business standards committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.
as a general matter, conflicts resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in investment banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. in addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the firmwide capital, commitments and suitability committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. these groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. conflicts resolution reports to our president and chief operating officer.
we regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
80   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis liquidity risk management overview liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. we have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.
treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite.
liquidity risk management, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.
liquidity risk management principles we manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of gcla to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate asset-liability management and (iii) maintain a viable contingency funding plan.
gcla. gcla is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. a primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. we believe that the securities held in our gcla would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.
our gcla reflects the following principles:
   the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a companys survival;

                                                                      focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;

                                                              during a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and

                                                                                            as a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.

we maintain our gcla across group inc., goldman sachs funding llc (funding ihc) and group inc.s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types, and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. in addition to the gcla, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.
we believe that our gcla provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment.
asset-liability management. our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
our approach to asset-liability management includes:
                                   conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. see balance sheet and funding sources  funding sources for further information;

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis
                                                                          actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis. we assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. this enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. see balance sheet and funding sources  balance sheet management for further information about our balance sheet management process and  funding sources  secured funding for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and

                                                                       raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets.
this reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.

our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. funding plans are reviewed and approved by the firmwide asset liability committee. in addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the firmwide asset liability committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. in a liquidity crisis, we would first use our gcla in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our gcla). however, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.
subsidiary funding policies the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc., which lends the necessary funds to funding ihc and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. in addition, group inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.
our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiarys funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, funding ihc or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. in particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc. or funding ihc. regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc. or funding ihc until the maturity of such financing.
group inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. for example, as of december 2018, group inc. had $29.05 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs&co., its principal u.s. registered broker-dealer; $39.69 billion invested in gsi, a regulated u.k. broker-dealer; $2.76 billion invested in gsjcl, a regulated japanese broker-dealer; $31.98 billion invested in gs bank usa, a regulated new york state-chartered bank; and $3.93 billion invested in gsib, a regulated u.k. bank. group inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $114.38 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $28.72 billion), and $18.09 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to gs&co., gsi, gsjcl and gs bank usa, as of december 2018. in addition, as of december 2018, group inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.
contingency funding plan. we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. the contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.
82   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination, control and distribution of information, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. the contingency funding plan also provides information about the responsibilities of these groups and individuals, which include making and disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication.
stress tests in order to determine the appropriate size of our gcla, we use an internal liquidity model, referred to as the modeled liquidity outflow, which captures and quantifies our liquidity risks. we also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity model, referred to as the intraday liquidity model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. the results of the modeled liquidity outflow, the intraday liquidity model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. we also perform stress tests that are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario.
modeled liquidity outflow. our modeled liquidity outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. these scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:
                     severely challenged market environments, including low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and

   a firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive departure, and/or a ratings downgrade.

the following are key modeling elements of the modeled liquidity outflow:
   liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;

   a two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;

                                        a combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows
(e.g., actions, though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). we assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis;

   no issuance of equity or unsecured debt;

   no support from additional government funding facilities. although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and

   no asset liquidation, other than the gcla.

the potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows covered in our modeled liquidity outflow include:
unsecured funding
   contractual: all upcoming maturities of unsecured long-term debt, commercial paper and other unsecured funding products. we assume that we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or roll over any maturing debt.

   contingent: repurchases of our outstanding long-term debt, commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as a market maker.

deposits
   contractual: all upcoming maturities of term deposits. we assume that we will be unable to raise new term deposits or roll over any maturing term deposits.

                  contingent: partial withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. the withdrawal assumptions reflect, among other factors, the type of deposit, whether the deposit is insured or uninsured, and our relationship with the depositor.

secured funding
                                                                        contractual: a portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts (i.e., on terms which require us to post additional collateral). our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying collateral, counterparty roll probabilities
(our assessment of the counterpartys likelihood of continuing to provide funding on a secured basis at the maturity of the trade) and counterparty concentration.

   contingent: adverse changes in the value of financial assets pledged as collateral for financing transactions, which would necessitate additional collateral postings under those transactions.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis otc derivatives
   contingent: collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our otc derivatives, excluding those that are cleared and settled through central counterparties (otc-cleared).

   contingent: other outflows of cash or collateral related to otc derivatives, excluding otc-cleared, including the impact of trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes, loss of rehypothecation rights, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings, and collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.

exchange-traded and otc-cleared derivatives
   contingent: variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange-traded and otc-cleared derivatives.

   contingent: an increase in initial margin and guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses.

customer cash and securities
       contingent: liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business, including withdrawals of customer credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.

securities
   contingent: liquidity outflows associated with a reduction or composition change in our short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.

unfunded commitments
   contingent: draws on our unfunded commitments. draw assumptions reflect, among other things, the type of commitment and counterparty.

other
   other upcoming large cash outflows, such as tax payments.

intraday liquidity model. our intraday liquidity model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our modeled liquidity outflow. the model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.
the following are key modeling elements of the intraday liquidity model:
   liquidity needs over a one-day settlement period;

   delays in receipt of counterparty cash payments;

   a reduction in the availability of intraday credit lines at our third-party clearing agents; and

   higher settlement volumes due to an increase in activity.

long-term stress testing. we utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. we are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
we also perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc or product-specific basis in response to market developments.
resolution liquidity models. in connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our resolution liquidity adequacy and positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. the liquidity needs are measured using our modeled liquidity outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. we have also established our resolution liquidity execution need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a group inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.
in addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc.
model review and validation we regularly refine our modeled liquidity outflow, intraday liquidity model and our other stress testing models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. any changes, including model assumptions, are approved by liquidity risk management. significant changes to these models are also approved by the risk governance committee.
these models are independently reviewed, validated and approved by model risk management. see model risk management for further information.
limits we use liquidity limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in monitoring and controlling our overall liquidity profile.
84   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the risk committee of the board and the risk governance committee approve liquidity risk limits at the firmwide level, consistent with our risk appetite statement. limits are reviewed frequently and amended, with required approvals, on a permanent and temporary basis, as appropriate, to reflect changing market or business conditions.
our liquidity risk limits are monitored by treasury and liquidity risk management. liquidity risk management is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.
gcla and unencumbered metrics gcla. based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both december 2018 and december 2017 was appropriate. we strictly limit our gcla to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. we do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our gcla, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.

in the table above:
                                                      the u.s. dollar-denominated gcla consists of (i) unencumbered u.s. government and agency obligations
(including highly liquid u.s. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in federal reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight u.s. dollar cash deposits.

   the non-u.s. dollar-denominated gcla consists of non-u.s. government obligations (only unencumbered german, french, japanese and u.k. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies.

we maintain our gcla to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, group inc., and its subsidiaries. our modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model incorporate a consolidated requirement for group inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. funding ihc is required to provide the necessary liquidity to group inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc. or funding ihc unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. in addition, the modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our gcla directly at group inc. or funding ihc to support such requirements.
other unencumbered assets. in addition to our gcla, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our gcla. the fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $177.08 billion for 2018 and $158.41 billion for 2017. we do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our gcla.
liquidity regulatory framework as a bhc, we are subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) under the lcr rule approved by the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies. the lcr rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (hqla) to expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. eligible hqla excludes hqla held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. we are required to maintain a minimum lcr of 100%. we expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our average lcr.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis in addition, the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule that calls for a net stable funding ratio (nsfr) for large u.s. banking organizations. the proposal would require banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. the proposed rule includes quarterly disclosure of the ratio and a description of the banking organizations stable funding sources. the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies have not released the final rule. we expect that we will be compliant with the nsfr requirement when it is effective.
the following is information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:
                                                                                 gs bank usa. gs bank usa is subject to a minimum lcr of 100%
under the lcr rule approved by the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies. as of december 2018, gs bank usas lcr exceeded the minimum requirement. the nsfr requirement described above would also apply to gs bank usa.

                                                                  gsi. gsi is subject to a minimum lcr of 100% under the lcr rule approved by the u.k. regulatory authorities and the european commission. gsis average monthly lcr for the trailing twelve-month period ended december 2018 exceeded the minimum requirement.

                                                                                               other subsidiaries. we monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. for many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the basel committees framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.

the implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities, could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.
credit ratings we rely on the short-term and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as otc derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. see risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.

86   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of:
   our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;

   the level and variability of our earnings;

   our capital base;

   our franchise, reputation and management;

   our corporate governance; and

   the external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.

certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we manage our gcla to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.
see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.
cash flows as a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.
year ended december 2018. our cash and cash equivalents increased by $20.50 billion to $130.55 billion at the end of 2018, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities and operating activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. the net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected increases in consumer deposits. the net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected net earnings and a decrease in collateralized transactions, partially offset by an increase in financial instruments owned. the net cash used for investing activities was primarily to fund corporate and commercial real estate loans.
year ended december 2017. our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.66 billion to $110.05 billion at the end of 2017. we used $18.23 billion in net cash for operating activities, reflecting a decrease in the net liability for receivables and payables due to client activity. we used $28.64 billion in net cash for investing activities, primarily to fund corporate and real estate loans, and investments in u.s. government and agency obligations accounted for as available-for-sale securities. we generated $35.21 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and increases in institutional and consumer deposits, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.
year ended december 2016. our cash and cash equivalents increased by $28.27 billion to $121.71 billion at the end of 2016. we generated $9.68 billion in net cash from investing activities, primarily from net cash acquired in business acquisitions. we generated $18.60 billion in net cash from financing activities and operating activities, primarily from increases in deposits and from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis market risk management overview market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, due to changes in market conditions. we employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. we hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities. our inventory, therefore, changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities. our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in market making and other principal transactions. categories of market risk include the following:
   interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;

   equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;

   currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and

    commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.

market risk management, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.
managers in revenue-producing units and market risk management discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. these managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.
market risk management process our process for managing market risk includes:
   collecting complete, accurate and timely information;

   a dynamic limit-setting framework;

   monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures;

   diversifying exposures;

   controlling position sizes;

   evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives; and

   proactive communication between our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.

our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of var and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.
risk measures market risk management produces risk measures and monitors them against established market risk limits. these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.
we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short-term and long-term time horizons. our primary risk measures are var, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.
88   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis value-at-risk. var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. for assets and liabilities included in var, see financial statement linkages to market risk measures. we typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. we use a single var model, which captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. as such, var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.
we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. inherent limitations to var include:
   var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;

   var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and

   previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.

to comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our var calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. these market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation. the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. as a result, even if our positions included in var were unchanged, our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.
given its reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.
our var measure does not include:
   positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and

   the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.

we perform daily backtesting of our var model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in var to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.
stress testing. stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and stress tests. the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes.
sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.
scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. for example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign inventory, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign inventory that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. when conducting scenario analysis, we typically consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. in addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis stress testing is designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, market, credit, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. stress tests are primarily used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process; however, stress testing is also integrated into our risk governance framework. this includes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for our capital planning and stress testing process. see equity capital management and regulatory capital  equity capital management for further information.
unlike var measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. instead, stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. when estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).
stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. stress testing is an important part of our risk management process because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions.
limits we use risk limits at various levels (including firmwide, business and product) to govern our risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk. limits are set based on var and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or tolerance for risk.
the risk committee of the board and the risk governance committee approve market risk limits and sub-limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite statement. in addition, market risk management (through delegated authority from the risk governance committee) sets market risk limits and sub-limits at certain product and desk levels.
the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling our overall risk profile. sub-limits are set below the approved level of risk limits. sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day-to-day basis without additional levels of senior management approval, effectively leaving day-to-day decisions to individual desk managers and traders. accordingly, sub-limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance. sub-limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand, taking into account the relative performance of each area.
our market risk limits are monitored by market risk management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. when a risk limit has been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations), it is escalated to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee. such instances are remediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the risk limit.
model review and validation our var and stress testing models are regularly reviewed by market risk management and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the composition of positions included in our market risk measures, as well as variations in market conditions. prior to implementing significant changes to our assumptions and/or models, model risk management performs model validations. significant changes to our var and stress testing models are reviewed with our chief risk officer and chief financial officer, and approved by the risk governance committee.
these models are independently reviewed, validated and approved by model risk management. see model risk management for further information.

the chart below presents daily var for 2018.
the chart below presents the frequency distribution of daily net revenues for positions included in var for 2018.
daily net revenues for positions included in var are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day. net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% one-day var (i.e., a var exception) on two occasions during 2018 and did not exceed our 95% one-day var during 2017.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer var exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more var exceptions. the daily net revenues for positions included in var used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.
sensitivity measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var because var is not the most appropriate risk measure. other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.

credit spread sensitivity on derivatives and financial liabilities. var excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a gain of $3 million (including hedges) as of both december 2018 and december 2017. in addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $41 million as of december 2018 and $35 million as of december 2017. however, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.
interest rate sensitivity. loans receivable were $80.59 billion as of december 2018 and $65.93 billion as of december 2017, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. the estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $607 million as of december 2018 and $527 million as of december 2017, of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.
other market risk considerations as of both december 2018 and december 2017, we had commitments and held loans for which we have obtained credit loss protection from sumitomo mitsui financial group, inc. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about such lending commitments.
in addition, we make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale and included in financial instruments owned in the consolidated statements of financial condition. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
we also make investments accounted for under the equity method and we also make direct investments in real estate, both of which are included in other assets. direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.

credit risk management, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. the risk governance committee reviews and approves credit policies and parameters. in addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans). these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by market risk management, consistent with other inventory positions. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by credit risk management.
credit risk management process our process for managing credit risk includes:
   collecting complete, accurate and timely information;

   approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits;

   monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our exposure;

   establishing or approving underwriting standards;

   assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;

   measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default;

   using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging;

   maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims; and

   proactive communication between our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis as part of the risk assessment process, credit risk management performs credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. for substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. a credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. the determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterpartys industry, and the economic environment. senior personnel within credit risk management, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.
our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, fair isaac corporation credit scores and other risk factors.
our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups). these systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.
risk measures and limits we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. for derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. for loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.
the risk committee of the board and the risk governance committee approve credit risk limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite statement. credit risk management (through delegated authority from the risk governance committee) sets credit limits for individual counterparties, economic groups, industries and countries. policies authorized by the firmwide enterprise risk committee and the risk governance committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for us to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas, taking into account any applicable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk mitigants.
we use credit limits at various levels (e.g., counterparty, economic group, industry and country), as well as underwriting standards to control the size and nature of our credit exposures. limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing risk appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations.
our credit risk limits are monitored by credit risk management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. when a risk limit has been exceeded, it is escalated to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee.
stress tests we use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). these shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. in the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring.
we perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. we also perform stress tests that are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario.
model review and validation our potential credit exposure and stress testing models, and any changes to such models or assumptions, are independently reviewed, validated and approved by model risk management. see model risk management for further information.
94   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level. we monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.
for loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.
when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterpartys obligations. we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.
credit exposures as of december 2018, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with december 2017, primarily reflecting an increase in cash deposits with central banks and loans and lending commitments, partially offset by a decrease in secured financing transactions. the percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased as compared with december 2017, reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2018 was lower as compared with our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during the prior year, and substantially all of such exposure was related to loans and lending commitments. our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2018 remained low, representing less than 0.5% of our total credit exposure, and estimated losses compared with the prior year were lower and not material. our credit exposures are described further below.
cash and cash equivalents. our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. to mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.
the table below presents credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and credit quality.

otc derivatives. our credit exposure on otc derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. as a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. we manage our credit exposure on otc derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.
we generally enter into otc derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. as credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (cva) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. cva is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.

   otc derivative assets, included in the consolidated statements of financial condition, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting)
and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting).

   collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily u.s. and non-u.s. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, which management considers when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under u.s. gaap.

the table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that management considers when determining credit risk.
other credit exposures. we are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. these receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.

the table above reflects collateral that management considers when determining credit risk.
selected exposures we have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus due to recent events and broad market concerns. credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short inventory due to changes in market prices.
the international sanctions on russia have led to concerns about its economic stability. as of december 2018, our total credit exposure to russia was $371 million, which was primarily with non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers, and was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. in addition, our total market exposure to russia as of december 2018 was $502 million, reflecting equity exposure with non-sovereign issuers or underliers.
98   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the potential restructuring of lebanons sovereign debt has led to concerns about its financial stability. as of december 2018, our credit exposure to lebanon was $570 million, substantially all of which related to loans and lending commitments with non-sovereign borrowers. after taking into consideration the benefit of cash and lebanese securities collateral held, our net credit exposure was not material. in addition, our total market exposure to lebanon as of december 2018 was not material.
the debt crisis in mozambique has resulted in credit rating downgrades and political instability in ukraine has led to economic concerns. in addition, venezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt and its political situation remains unclear. as of december 2018, our total credit and market exposure to each of mozambique, ukraine and venezuela was not material.
we have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. we determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underliers assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. we monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level.
we use regular stress tests, described above, to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors. to supplement these regular stress tests, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. these stress tests are designed to estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including, but not limited to, currency rates, interest rates, and equity prices. we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.
see stress tests above, liquidity risk management  stress tests and market risk management  risk measures  stress testing for further information about stress tests.
operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.
potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:
   clients, products and business practices;

   execution, delivery and process management;

   business disruption and system failures;

   employment practices and workplace safety;

   damage to physical assets;

   internal fraud; and

   external fraud.

we maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. the firmwide conduct and operational risk committee is globally responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks, policies, parameters, limits and thresholds which govern our operational risks.
operational risk management, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.
operational risk management process our process for managing operational risk includes:
   collecting complete, accurate and timely information;

   training, supervision and development of our people;

   active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating our key operational risks;

   independent risk oversight and control functions that monitor operational risk, and implementation of policies and procedures, and controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events; and

   proactive communication between our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. from a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. from a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.
our operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the capital framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.
our operational risk management framework consists of the following practices:
   risk identification and assessment;

   risk measurement; and

   risk monitoring and reporting.

risk identification and assessment the core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and assessment. we have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.
we have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. when operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.
we use operational risk management applications to capture and organize operational risk event data and key metrics. one of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. this process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. the results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.
risk measurement we measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including, but not limited to:
   evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;

   the degree of automation in our processes;

   new activity information;

   the legal and regulatory environment; and

   changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.

the results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. these analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold.
stress tests we perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes. we also perform stress tests that are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario.
risk monitoring and reporting we evaluate changes in our operational risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring the factors noted above at a firmwide level. we have both preventive and detective internal controls, which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events. we monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls.
we have established limits and thresholds consistent with our risk appetite statement that are approved by the risk committee of the board, as well as escalation protocols. our operational risk limits and thresholds are monitored by operational risk management. operational risk management is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits and thresholds have been exceeded.
model review and validation the statistical models utilized by operational risk management are independently reviewed, validated and approved by model risk management. see model risk management for further information.
100   goldman sachs 2018 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis model risk management overview model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. we rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and financial liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.
our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. the firmwide model risk control committee oversees our model risk management framework.
model risk management, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the risk committee of the board.
model review and validation process model risk management consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. this review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. model risk management reviews all existing models on an annual basis, and approves new models or significant changes to models prior to implementation.
the model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:
   the models conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;

   the testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;

   the suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;

   the models accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;

   the models consistency with models for similar products; and

   the models sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.

see critical accounting policies  fair value  review of valuation models, liquidity risk management, market risk management, credit risk management and operational risk management for further information about our use of models within these areas.

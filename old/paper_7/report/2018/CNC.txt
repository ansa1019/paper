item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. the discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under part i, item 1a."risk factors" of this form 10-k.
executive overview general we are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. we provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.
results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (sg&a) costs. we measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. the health benefits ratio (hbr) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided. the sg&a expense ratio represents sg&a costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.
on december 12, 2018, the board of directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on february 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of december 24, 2018. all share, per share and stock price information presented in this form 10-k has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.
fidelis care acquisition on july 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of new york state catholic health plan, inc., d/b/a fidelis care new york (fidelis care) for approximately $3.6 billion of cash consideration, which includes a working capital adjustment. the cash consideration was funded through approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of new long-term debt. both offerings were completed in may 2018. the fidelis care acquisition expanded our health plan footprint to new york state. as a result of the completion of the fidelis care acquisition, our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 include the results of operations of fidelis care from july 1, 2018 to december 31, 2018. due to the size of the acquisition, one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section is related to the fidelis care acquisition.
as part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the fidelis care acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the new york state department of health. these undertakings contain various commitments by us effective upon completion of the fidelis care acquisition. one of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the state of new york to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within new york state. the present value of the $340 million contribution to the state of new york, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.
acquisitions and investments we continued to execute on our growth strategy through acquisitions and investments during 2018. in the first quarter of 2018, we acquired community medical holdings corp., d/b/a community medical group (cmg), an at-risk primary care provider serving medicaid, medicare advantage, and health insurance marketplace patients in miami-dade county, florida. cmg has a multi-payor strategy and serves members of our florida health plan. the acquisition increases our scale and capabilities and creates a vertical integration opportunity with providers. in the first quarter of 2018, we also acquired an additional 61% ownership in interpreta holdings, inc. (interpreta), a clinical and genomics data analytics business, bringing our total ownership to 80%. in the first and second quarters of 2018, we completed a 28% equity method investment in rxadvance (rxa), a full-service pharmacy benefit manager (pbm) with an innovative technology platform. in the third quarter of 2018, we made an additional investment in rxa in the form of convertible preferred stock. both the interpreta and rxa transactions reflect our commitment to technological innovation and providing comprehensive and integrated specialty services.
36
in the second quarter of 2018, we acquired mhm services inc. (mhm), a provider of behavioral health, medical and dental services to correctional facilities, state hospitals, courts, juvenile facilities and community clinics. under the terms of the agreement, we also acquired the remaining 49% ownership of centurion, the correctional healthcare services joint venture between mhm and us, expanding our national footprint in the correctional healthcare sector.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, our spanish subsidiary, primero salud, acquired 89% of torrejón salud, the concessionaire of the university hospital of torrejón de ardoz in the community of madrid, expanding our presence in spain.
regulatory trends and uncertainties in december 2018, a federal district judge in texas ruled that the entire affordable care act (aca) is unconstitutional in the case of "texas v. united states of america." the case centers on the argument that the law's individual mandate requirement was essential to the aca, and without it, the remainder of the aca was invalid. the company remains focused on the promise of delivering access to quality, affordable healthcare to all of its members, following the district court decision regarding the constitutionality of the aca. the aca will remain in its current form for 2019. we believe the aca will remain in its current form or in modified form that ensures the continuation of coverage for existing members beyond 2019.
we have more than three decades of experience, spanning six presidents from both sides of the aisle, in delivering high-quality healthcare services on behalf of states and the federal government to uninsured families, commercial organizations and military families. we continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.
for additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see part i, item 1 "business - regulation" and item 1a, "risk factors."

from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018, our membership increased as a result of:
•   the fidelis care acquisition; and
•   membership growth in our health insurance marketplace service areas.
these increases were partially offset by a net decrease in our behavioral health membership as many states are combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members.
from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017, our membership increased as a result of:
•   membership growth in our health insurance marketplace service areas;
•   the commencement of health plan management services for medicaid operations in maryland;
•   an expanded statewide managed care contract in missouri; and
•   the commencement of new managed care contracts in nebraska and nevada.

(1) medicare includes medicare advantage, medicare supplement, special needs plans, and mmp.
total revenues increased 24% in the year ended december 31, 2018, over the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. this was partially offset by lower revenues as a result of the removal of the ihss program from california's medicaid contract in january 2018. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018, we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.
operating expenses medical costs results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. the hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premiums received and the medical services provided.
the hbr for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 85.9%, a decrease of 140 basis points over the comparable period in 2017. the hbr decrease compared to last year was driven by membership growth in the health insurance marketplace business, the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, and the recognition of the previously mentioned ihss program reconciliation. this was partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care, which operates at a higher hbr.
cost of services cost of services increased by $539 million in the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. this was primarily due to the acquisition of foundation care in october 2017 and growth in our correctional services business, including the acquisition of mhm.
the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 85.0%, compared to 81.5% in 2017. the cost of service ratio was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points for the costs associated with the veterans affairs contract expiration. the increase in the cost of service ratio was also due to lower margins associated with our other federal services business and growth in our specialty pharmacy business due to the acquisition of foundation care in october 2017, which operates at a higher cost of service ratio. these increases were partially offset by growth in our correctional services business resulting from the acquisition of mhm, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. this was primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care, including acquisition related expenses, costs associated with the previously mentioned veterans affairs contract expiration, and expansions, new programs and growth in many of our states in 2018, including growth in the health insurance marketplace business. these increases were partially offset by the $56 million recognized during 2017 for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of penn treaty.
44
the sg&a expense ratio was 10.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 9.7% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses. the adjusted sg&a expense ratio was 10.0% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 9.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the sg&a and adjusted sg&a expense ratios both increased due to growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the impact of the removal of the ihss program from california's medicaid contract in january 2018. these increases in both ratios were partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care.
health insurer fee expense health insurance fee expense was $709 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not record health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31, 2017.
other income (expense)
the following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, ($ in millions):
2018                                        2017
investment and other income      $253              $190
interest expense                 (343   )          (255   )
other income (expense), net      $(90   )          $(65   )
the increase in investment income in 2018 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2017, including the impact of higher investment balances as a result of organic portfolio growth and the fidelis care acquisition. these increases were partially offset by 2017 interest income from the state of illinois related to capitation payment delays. interest expense increased by $88 million in the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting a net increase in borrowings, primarily related to the financing of the fidelis care acquisition and the effect of our interest rate swaps.
income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $474 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.4 billion, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%. the effective tax rate reflects the lower corporate tax rate as enacted in the tcja, partially offset by an increased tax rate due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%, which reflects the higher corporate tax rate for 2017, the one-time effects of the tcja, and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.

managed care total revenues increased 25% in the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care and expansions, new programs, and growth in many of our states, particularly florida, georgia, illinois, missouri, pennsylvania, and texas, including growth in the health insurance marketplace business. total revenues also increased as a result of the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. these increases were partially offset by the impact of the removal of the ihss program from california's medicaid contract in january 2018 and a reduction in pass through payments from the state of california in 2018 compared to 2017. earnings from operations increased $393 million between years primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018, partially offset by increased acquisition related expenses. in addition, 2017 was negatively impacted by the penn treaty assessment expense.
specialty services total revenues increased 4% in the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, resulting primarily from increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue for our behavioral health services business as a result of many states combining these services within our physical health contracts in order to integrate physical and behavioral health care to achieve a more holistic care model for our members. earnings from operations decreased $134 million between years primarily due to costs associated with the previously mentioned veterans affairs contract expiration and lower margins in our other federal services and behavioral health services businesses, partially offset by growth in our pharmacy benefits management business.
beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we expect lower earnings in our specialty services segment and corresponding higher earnings in our managed care segment as we move to transparent pharmacy pricing. this reflects our commitment to transparency and more closely aligns the costs of care within each segment. it also aligns with our continued transition to the next generation rxadvance pharmacy platform during 2019 and 2020.

(1) medicare includes medicare advantage, medicare supplement, special needs plans, and mmp.
total revenues increased 19% in the year ended december 31, 2017, over the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of health net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the health insurance marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. this was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in california as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017, compared to $531 million recognized in 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we received medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite rate change across all of our markets.

operating expenses medical costs the hbr for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 87.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the comparable period in 2016. the increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california, which reduced the 2016 hbr by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for california medicaid expansion effective july 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher hbr. these increases were partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business, which operates at a lower hbr.
cost of services cost of services decreased by $17 million in the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. this was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business, partially offset by growth in our correctional business. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 81.5%, compared to 85.5% in 2016. the decrease in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our home-based primary care business.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a increased by $773 million in the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. this was primarily a result of:
•   a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results;
•   the impact of new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017;
•   higher business expansion costs;
•   additional expense recognized for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of penn treaty; and
•   higher variable compensation expenses based on the performance of the business in 2017.
the increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $214 million.
the sg&a expense ratio was 9.7% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 9.8% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease in the sg&a expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the penn treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the health net business, which operates at a higher sg&a expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business.
the adjusted sg&a expense ratio was 9.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 9.0% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in the adjusted sg&a expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher sg&a expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and medicare business.
health insurer fee expense as a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $461 million recognized for the year ended december 31, 2016.

the increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016, as well as interest income from the state of illinois related to capitation payment delays. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2017 by $38 million due to an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to the issuance of an additional $2.4 billion in senior notes in february 2016 in connection with the financing of the health net transaction.
income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%. the effective tax rate reflects the effect of income tax reform and the health insurer fee moratorium. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded lower income tax expense of $125 million related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction, primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.6%, which reflects the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of health net.

in january 2017, we reclassified cenpatico behavioral health of arizona, llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment due to a reorganization of the arizona management structure following the health net integration. as a result, the financial results of cenpatico behavioral health of arizona, llc and the related cenpatico integrated care health plan have been reclassified from the specialty services segment to the managed care segment for all periods presented.
managed care total revenues increased 19% in the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results and growth, expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly arkansas, florida, georgia, indiana, louisiana, missouri, nebraska, ohio, and texas, partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium. earnings from operations decreased $163 million between years primarily as a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum mlr change in california, the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017, and new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher hbr and incur start-up costs. these drivers were partially offset by $214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the health insurance marketplace business.
specialty services total revenues increased 44% in the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting primarily from the a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results, the continued integration of health net into our specialty services, increased services associated with membership growth in the managed care segment, and growth in our correctional services and home-based primary care businesses. earnings from operations increased $99 million between years primarily due to a full year of the health net business in our 2017 results.

cash flows provided by operating activities normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were $1.2 billion, or 1.4 times net earnings, compared to $1.5 billion in 2017. the cash provided by operations in 2018 was primarily due to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities, primarily resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business. cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables of $1.2 billion, due to growth in the business. additionally, cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the repayment of approximately $1.0 billion of medicaid expansion rate overpayments and medicaid expansion mlr rebates in california, which was previously accrued.
cash flows from operating activities for 2017 was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. cash provided by operations in 2017 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the commencement of the nebraska and nevada health plans. cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $1.9 billion. cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables. additionally, cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately $445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date.
cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. states may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. we typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.

cash flows used in investing activities investing activities used cash of $4.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, $1.3 billion in 2017, and $2.5 billion in 2016.  cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 primarily consisted of the fidelis care and other acquisitions, the net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries (including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments), the investments in rxadvance, and capital expenditures.
we spent $675 million and $422 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions.
as of december 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.3 years. we had unregulated cash and investments of $478 million at december 31, 2018, compared to $310 million at december 31, 2017. unregulated cash and investments include private equity investments and company owned life insurance contracts.
49
cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of health net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures. in march 2016, we acquired health net for approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. the total consideration for the acquisition was $5.3 billion, consisting of centene common shares valued at $3.0 billion, $2.2 billion in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.
cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities our financing activities provided cash of $4.6 billion in 2018, compared to using cash of $82 million in 2017 and providing cash of $2.7 billion in 2016, respectively. financing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed below.
2018
during 2018, our net financing activities primarily related to our offering of $2.8 billion in shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026, and additional borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. proceeds from both offerings were used to fund the fidelis care acquisition which closed on july 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest.
2017
during 2017, our net financing activities primarily related to common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest, partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. in december 2017, we amended and increased our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (revolving credit facility) to $1.5 billion.
2016
during 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in february 2016 associated with the health net acquisition, the issuance of additional senior notes in june 2016 and november 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% senior notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% senior notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
in february 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (escrow issuer) issued $1.4 billion of 5.625% senior notes ($1.4 billion notes) at par due 2021 and $1.0 billion of 6.125% senior notes ($1.0 billion notes) at par due 2024. we used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the health net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. in connection with the february 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1.0 billion, at floating rates of interest based on the three month libor plus 4.22% and the three month libor plus 4.44%, respectively. gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1.4 billion notes and $1.0 billion notes.
in connection with the closing of the health net acquisition on march 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with the revolving credit facility. borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates, the federal funds rate or the prime rate.
in june 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 million add-on notes). the $500 million add-on notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% senior notes issued april 2014. we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.
50
in november 2016, we issued $1.2 billion of 4.75% senior notes due 2025 ($1.2 billion notes). we used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2017 and health net's $400 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.
liquidity metrics the credit agreement underlying our revolving credit facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-ebitda ratios. we are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-ebitda ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2018, we had $284 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. as of december 31, 2018, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-ebitda ratio.
we have a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. the loan bears interest based on the one month libor plus 2.70% and matures in april 2021 with an optional one-year extension. the agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. we have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. as of december 31, 2018, we had $63 million of borrowings outstanding under the loan.
we had outstanding letters of credit of $56 million as of december 31, 2018, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. we also had letters of credit for $27 million (valued at the december 31, 2018 conversion rate), or €24 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support ribera salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 0.99% as of december 31, 2018. in addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $496 million as of december 31, 2018.
the indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of centene corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants.
as discussed above, in may 2018, we issued approximately $2.8 billion of new equity, and approximately $1.8 billion of 5.375% senior notes at par due 2026. proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the fidelis care acquisition which closed on july 1, 2018, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.
at december 31, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $27 million, compared to negative $629 million at december 31, 2017. we manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.
at december 31, 2018, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 37.8%, compared to 40.6% at december 31, 2017. excluding the $120 million non-recourse mortgage note and construction loan, our debt to capital ratio was 37.4% as of december 31, 2018, compared to 40.3% at december 31, 2017. we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 16 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. we have 7 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of december 31, 2018. no duration has been placed on the repurchase program. we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received dividends of $475 million, $312 million, and $121 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.
51
2019 expectations during 2019, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $327 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $650 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. these amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our revolving credit facility and construction loan. however, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. in addition, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.
based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future contractual obligations. these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, revolving credit facility, mortgages and capital leases. the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):

(1) our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018, includes $1,259 million of other long-term liabilities. this consists primarily of long-term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, liabilities related to certain undertakings, reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations. these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
commitments as part of the regulatory approval process in connection with the fidelis care acquisition, we entered into certain undertakings with the new york state department of health. these undertakings contain various commitments by us that were effective upon completion of the fidelis care acquisition. one of the undertakings includes a $340 million contribution by us to the state of new york to be paid over a five-year period for initiatives consistent with our mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within new york state. the present value of the contribution to the state of new york, approximately $328 million, was expensed during 2018.
in addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the health net acquisition from the california department of insurance and the california department of managed health care, in 2016 we committed to certain undertakings (the california undertakings). the california undertakings included, among other items, operational commitments around premiums, dividend restrictions, minimum risk based capital (rbc) levels, local offices, growth, accreditation, hedis scores and other quality measures, network adequacy, certifications, investments and capital expenditures. specifically, we agreed to, among other things:
•   invest an additional $30 million through the california organized investment network over the five years following completion of the acquisition;
•   build a service center in an economically distressed community in california, investing $200 million over 10 years and employing at least 300 people, of which we have incurred $8 million through 2018;

•   contribute $65 million to improve enrollee health outcomes ($10 million over five years), support locally-based consumer assistance programs ($5 million over five years) and strengthen the healthcare delivery system ($50 million over five years), of which we have contributed $13 million through 2018, and;
•   invest $75 million of its investment portfolio in vehicles supporting california's healthcare infrastructure, of which we have invested $12 million through 2018.
the california undertakings require significant investments by us, may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies, and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as managed care organizations, most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.
our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. as of december 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $7,259 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $3,279 million. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we contributed $154 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries. for our subsidiaries that file with the national association of insurance commissioners (naic), we estimate our rbc percentage to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
under the california knox-keene health care service plan act of 1975, as amended ("knox-keene"), certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (tne) requirements. under these knox-keene tne requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures, excluding capitated amounts. in addition, certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities' tne below the required amount as specified in the undertaking.
under the new york state department of health codes, rules and regulations title 10, part 98, our new york subsidiary must comply with contingent reserve requirements.  under these requirements, net worth based upon admitted assets must equal or exceed a minimum amount based on annual net premium income.
the naic has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. as of december 31, 2018, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. as of december 31, 2018, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $3,279 million in the aggregate.

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2. summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. our accounting policies regarding intangible assets, medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include, but are not limited to, member attrition rates, contract renewal probabilities, revenue growth rates, expectations of profitability, discount and royalty rates. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. at december 31, 2018, we had $7,015 million of goodwill and $2,239 million of other intangible assets.
intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:
intangible asset            amortization period purchased contract rights          5 - 15 years provider contracts                 4 - 15 years customer relationships             3 - 15 years trade names                        7 - 20 years developed technologies              2 - 7 years our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.
goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. in addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. these factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. however, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. the goodwill of $267 million associated with our home health business is expected to be recovered. however, the penetration of this business model into our medicaid population has been slower than anticipated. the associated decreased profitability has been offset by the performance of our shared savings demonstration programs. to the extent the demonstration programs change substantially in advance of the medicaid penetration, the reporting unit could be at risk for impairment.

medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or ibnr, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice. these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. in many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. for more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. for older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates. the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs. when we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. see "risk factors - failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows." these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.
the paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate. the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31, 2018 data:

while we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. for example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $45 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum mlr programs. the estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.

(1) days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider. as a result, the liability generally is described as having a "short-tail," which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year. we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31, 2018 will be known by the end of 2019.

changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. additionally, as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs, approximately $25 million, $1 million and $39 million of the "incurred related to: prior years" was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates. while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. in these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr.
the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:
•   appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with interqual or other criteria.
•   management of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.
•   emergency department program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency department setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.).
•   increased emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.
•   incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.
•   prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our start smart for your baby outreach service.
revenue recognition our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans, premiums received from our members and cms for our medicare product, and premiums from members of our commercial health plans. in addition to member premium payments, our marketplace contracts also generate revenues from subsidies received from cms. we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable. in some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of its membership. generally, the risk score is determined by the state or cms analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's membership. we estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis. some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.
our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum hbr or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. in certain circumstances, including commercial plans, our plans may be required to return premium to the state or policyholders in the event profits exceed established levels. we estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period. other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. for performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states or cms, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states or cms for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known. we continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available. it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.

our medicare advantage contracts are with cms. cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs. under this risk adjustment methodology, cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. we and the healthcare providers collect, compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines. we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis.
our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services. we recognize revenue related to administrative services under the tricare government-sponsored managed care support contract on a straight-line basis over the option period, when the fees become fixed and determinable. the tricare contract includes various performance-based measures. for each of the measures, an estimate of the amount that has been earned is made at each interim date, and revenue is recognized accordingly.
some states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider pass-through payments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses. additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual hif. the aca imposed the hif in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018. the hif was suspended in 2017 and 2019. if we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the hif, we recognize revenue associated with the hif on a straight-line basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements, including the "gross-up" to reflect the hifs non-tax deductible nature. collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. for certain products, premium taxes, state assessments and the hif are not pass-through payments and are recorded as premium revenue and premium tax expense or health insurer fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

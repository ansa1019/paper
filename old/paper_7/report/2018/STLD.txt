the average cost of steel consumed increased by 15% in 2017, consistent with increased selling prices discussed in the steel operations results, as compared to 2016, while average selling prices increased only 5%, resulting in metal spread contracting 5%. operating income decreased 4% to $87.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as increased shipments were more than offset by metal spread contraction.

other operations other operations consist of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of smaller joint ventures and minnesota ironmaking operations that have been idle since may 2015. also included in "other" are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company's senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses.
during the fourth quarter of 2016 impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
consolidated results 2018 vs. 2017
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $416.6 million during 2018 increased 6% from $394.6 million during 2017, representing 3.5% and 4.1% of net sales, respectively. profit sharing expense during 2018 of $156.0 million increased 71% from the $91.3 million during 2017, consistent with our increased profitability.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2018, interest expense decreased 6% to $126.6 million from $134.4 million during 2017, due to the repayment of our $350.0 million 6.375% senior notes due 2022, with 4.125% senior notes due 2025 in the latter half of 2017.
other expense (income), net. net other income of $24.0 million in 2018 consists primarily of interest income associated with our invested cash and short-term investments. net other income of $2.8 million in 2017 included $14.6 million of offsetting costs associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2022, which were more than offset by other income, primarily interest.
income tax expense.  during 2018, our income tax expense was $364.0 million at an effective income tax rate of 22.5%, as compared to $129.4 million at an effective income tax rate of 13.8%, during 2017. the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due to a one-time $180.6 million net federal tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, which reduced our 2017 effective tax rate 19.3%.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $10.1 million at december 31, 2018, are potential benefits of $6.0 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recognized a benefit from the decrease of interest expense of $1.3 million, net of tax.  in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $2.4 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2018.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. we have concluded u.s. federal income tax audits through 2015. we are subject to examination and proposed adjustments by the irs for years 2016 and 2017, and tax years 2014-2017 remain open to various state and local jurisdictions. at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $5.3 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.
consolidated results 2017 vs. 2016
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $394.6 million during 2017 increased 6% from $374.0 million during 2016, representing approximately 4.1% and 4.8% of net sales, respectively. the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, associated with our increased profitability. profit sharing of $91.3 million in 2017, increased $21.0 million, or 28% over 2016, with our increased profitability.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2017, interest expense decreased $11.6 million to $134.4 million, when compared to 2016. the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our senior notes outstanding. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we called and repaid $400.0 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2019 with 5.000% senior notes due 2026. also, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we early paid off the remaining $228.1 million of outstanding senior term loan debt. in addition, in the second half of 2017, we called and repaid our $350.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2022 with 4.125% senior notes due 2025.
36
other expense (income), net. net other income of $2.8 million in 2017 included $14.6 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2022, which were more than offset by other income, primarily interest. net other expense of $17.8 million in 2016 included $16.5 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2019.
income tax expense.  during 2017, our income tax expense was $129.4 million at an effective income tax rate of 13.8%, as compared to income tax expense of $204.1 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 36.2% during 2016. the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due primarily to a one-time $180.6 million net federal tax benefit resulting from our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, and discrete tax benefits related to valuation allowance reductions, state tax refunds and equity-based compensation.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long‐term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, stock repurchases, and acquisitions. we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2018, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents              $828,220
short-term investments             228,783
revolver availability            1,188,009
total liquidity                 $2,245,012
our total outstanding debt decreased $5.2 million during 2018 due to decreased revolving credit facility borrowings at one of our controlled subsidiaries. our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) decreased to 37.9% at december 31, 2018, compared to 41.9% at december 31, 2017, due to increases in total equity from earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases.
our senior secured credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion revolver, was renewed and extended in june 2018 to extend maturity to june 2023. subject to certain conditions, we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least $750.0 million. the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries; and is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries' receivables and inventories, and by pledges of all shares of our wholly-owned subsidiaries' capital stock or other equity interests, and intercompany debt held by us as collateral. the revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions, or enter into other specified transactions and activities. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $12.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a net debt (as defined in the facility) to ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00 must be maintained. if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. at december 31, 2018, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 16.88:1.00 and 0.85:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2018, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital. we generated cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion in 2018. operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) increased $284.4 million, excluding acquired heartland working capital, to $1.9 billion at december 31, 2018, consistent with increases in volumes, selling prices, inventory costs, and profitability during 2018.
capital investments. during 2018, we invested $239.4 million in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our steel operations segment, compared with $164.9 million invested during 2017. the increase in 2018 relates primarily to organic steel growth opportunities.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 21% to $0.1875 per share in the first quarter 2018 (from $0.155 per share in 2017), resulting in declared cash dividends of $174.4 million during 2018, compared to $148.2 million during 2017. we paid cash dividends of $168.9 million and $145.6 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various
37
factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. in addition, the terms of our facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay.
other. in 2016, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $450 million of our common stock, and in august 2018 an additional share repurchase program of up to $750 million of our common stock. under the share repurchase programs, purchases will take place, as and when, we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions.  the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time. we acquired 13.1 million shares of our common stock for $523.6 million in 2018 pursuant to these programs, completing the 2016 $450 million program and initiating the 2018 $750 million program. see part ii, item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including if necessary borrowings under our revolver through its term, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.
during 2018, we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately $13.0 million. based on our current abatements and incentive credits, and utilizing our existing long-lived asset structure, we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately $12.1 million, $6.3 million, $5.9 million, $5.8 million, $5.3 million, $5.0 million, and $4.8 million during the years 2019 through 2025, respectively.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles. based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. it does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary course of business. the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2018 (in thousands):

(1)the long-term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes remain outstanding until maturity. refer to note 3. long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions, and our long-term debt.
(2)the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 5.125% on our $700.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021; 51/4% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due april 2023; 5.500% on our $500.0 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024; 4.125% on our $350.0 million senior unsecured notes due september 2025; 5.00% on our $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due december 2026; 0.225% commitment fee on our available revolver; and an average of 5.2% on our other debt of $51.4 million.
(3)purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity, natural gas and its transportation, fuel, air products, electrodes, alloys, and zinc. these arrangements have "take or pay" or other similar commitment provisions. we have utilized such "take or pay" requirements during the past three years under these contracts, except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which have been idle since may 2015.
(4)construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2018.
(5)other commitments principally relate to deferred compensation plan obligations.
38
(6)we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $12.5 million as of december 31, 2018, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2018, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $42.3 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $574,000. of the costs incurred during 2018 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 76% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $267,000 at all of our facilities during 2018. we have an accrual of $3.3 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change. critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts. except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied, and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery, at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive, including any variable consideration. the variable consideration included in the company's steel operations segment contracts, which is not constrained, include estimated product returns and customer claims, and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis. our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive. revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract. the company does not exercise significant judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience. if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends, additional provision may be necessary. the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our best estimate of known credit risks, historical experience, and current economic conditions affecting our customers, which estimates may or may not prove accurate.
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers, which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors, including the construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous scrap, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills. our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the non-residential construction market. we mitigate our exposure to credit risk, which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowance may be required.
39
inventories. we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. we record amounts required, if any, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold.  if product selling prices were to decline in future periods, further write-down of inventory could result, specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing.
impairments of long-lived tangible and definite‐lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic climate in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell. an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. as of december 31, 2018, and 2017, the company reported $8.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet.  an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell.  for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell. the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820, consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management's own assumptions.
significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations. the company therefore undertook a fourth quarter 2016 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily our mining resources and mesabi mining operation's fixed assets. with the company's outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows, the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable, and they were in fact impaired. this 2016 assessment resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $127.3 million, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $13.1 million, which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. by $72.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at that time as determined primarily on the cost approach, as well as expected future discounted cash flows (an income approach), using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.    our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 (in thousands):

2018                               2017

at least once annually (as of october 1) or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. we utilize a two-stepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment. the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment. in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (which includes goodwill). the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the company performs the second step of the test, which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded. in the second step, the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated. if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value.

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.
our fourth quarter 2018, 2017, and 2016 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges.  management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing. otherwise, all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2019. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.
in 2016, a $5.5 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a third-party pertaining to certain omnisource long-lived assets, inventory, and spare parts, as provided under asc 350.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits, improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. in addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. finally, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.
in may 2018 and february 2019, we initiated restructuring plans primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the "2018 footprint realignment plan" and the "2019 footprint realignment plan," respectively). the 2018 footprint realignment plan, which also involves the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations, and the 2019 footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed during 2024 and 2022, respectively. for additional information on both of these plans and a discussion of our other ongoing restructuring programs, see "restructuring and impairment charges" under "results of operations" below.
we have continued to expand our presence within the medical device industry through strategic acquisitions. during 2018, we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement our interventional and surgical product portfolios. the total fair value of the consideration transferred in connection with these acquisitions was $172.3 million, which included initial payments of $117.6 million and contingent consideration having an estimated fair value of $54.7 million. the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of the company's obligations to make additional payments if certain sales and regulatory goals are met.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we also completed several distributor to direct sales conversions. the aggregate consideration we transferred in connection with these transactions was $4.9 million.
in october 2017, we completed the acquisition of neotract, inc. ("neotract"), a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bph. we made initial payments of $725.6 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of $1.4 million and agreed to pay up to an additional $300 million in the aggregate contingent if we achieve specified net sales goals through the end of 2020. we made an additional payment of $75 million during 2018 as a result of the achievement of a sales goal for the period from january 1, 2018 to april 30, 2018. in february 2017, we completed the acquisition of vascular solutions, inc. ("vascular solutions"), a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, for an aggregate purchase price of $975.5 million. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed acquisitions related to our anesthesia and respiratory product portfolios and distributor to direct sales conversions. the total fair value of the consideration related to these acquisitions was $80.1 million.
u.s. tax legislation u.s. tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") was enacted on december 22, 2017. the legislation significantly changes united states (or "u.s.") tax law by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; implementing a territorial tax system, generally
34
providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met; and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax.
on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja. sab 118 states that in these circumstances, if the company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects, the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined (and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined). we included a provisional $107.9 million net tax expense related to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017.
during 2018, we made adjustments to the provisional amounts for taxes on deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and in our assumptions, and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance. as prescribed under sab 118, these adjustments were identified and recorded as discrete adjustments in the period in which such changes were made. during 2018, we recognized a net $2.3 million discrete tax benefit as a result of adjustments to the provisional tax impacts of the tcja included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017. these adjustments included a $0.2 million reduction in the provisional tax on deemed repatriated earnings and a $2.1 million tax benefit from changes in our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. we completed our accounting for these impacts during the fourth quarter 2018.
health care reform in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. the legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. [several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed, but not adopted, in 2017. however, the tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act, which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage.] as a result, the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to increased uncertainty. moreover, on december 14, 2018, the united states district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid, although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal. the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act, any court decision regarding the act's validity and, generally, the longer-term viability of the act, is uncertain.
the affordable care act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. although the excise tax has been suspended through 2019, its status remains unclear for subsequent years.
global economic conditions global economic conditions in the past decade have had an adverse impact on market activities due to, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. while there generally has been some improvement in economic conditions recently, the degree of improvement has been uneven among our regional markets, and the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth, constricted credit,
35
public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
in recent years, hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. despite recent improvements in the economic environment, challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 95% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. conversely, our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered, although, as noted above, the affordable care act may be subject to repeal, a final court determination of invalidity, further modification or replacement; therefore, the longer-term viability of the act is uncertain.
a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt, annual deficits and high levels of unemployment. despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe, the prospects for continued growth are uncertain, and the healthcare sector remains weak. in particular, budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures, such as delays in approvals for elective surgeries.the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe, most notably greece, spain, portugal and italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries. moreover, the impact of ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of the departure of the united kingdom from the european union and political developments in european nations could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere.
in asia, we believe the economic outlook for the healthcare sector generally is positive. however, a deceleration of growth in the chinese economy and recent us-china trade tensions have increased uncertainties within asia. in addition, we continue to confront government-implemented price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in china and india. there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. moreover, many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries.
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina, brazil, and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices. although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and "existing products" are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors, either through acquisition or termination of the distributor, from the sales channel.
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
revenues
2018                             2017                  2016

net revenues      $2,448.4              $2,146.3              $1,868.0
36
comparison of 2018 and 2017
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased 14.1%, or $302.1 million, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to net revenues of $165.1 million generated by acquired businesses, primarily neotract, a $60.4 million increase in sales volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new product sales and favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased 14.9%, or $278.3 million, compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to net revenues of $205.8 million generated by acquired businesses, primarily vascular solutions and neotract and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new product sales.
gross profit
2018                                                      2017                2016
(dollars in millions)
gross profit                $1,384.4              $1,171.8              $996.2
percentage of revenues          56.5   %              54.6   %            53.3   %
comparison of 2018 and 2017
for the year ended december 31, 2018, gross margin increased 190 basis points, or 3.5%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin reflects the favorable impact of gross profit generated by acquired businesses, primarily neotract, and the impact of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflected the adverse impact of the step-up in carrying value of inventory recognized in connection with the vascular solutions acquisition.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
for the year ended december 31, 2017, gross margin increased 130 basis points, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to gross margin generated by acquired businesses, a more favorable mix of products sold, cost improvement initiatives, including the 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans described below and the impact of price increases. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable $10.4 million impact of the step-up in carrying value of inventory recognized in connection with the vascular solutions acquisition that adversely affected cost of goods sold upon sale of such inventory during 2017, as well as higher logistics and distributions costs.
selling, general and administrative
2018                                                               2017                2016

comparison of 2018 and 2017
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $178.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to expenses incurred by our acquired businesses (primarily neotract, which we acquired in october 2017), which consisted of a $49.4 million increase in contingent consideration expense resulting from a change in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, a $48.2 million increase in amortization expense and a $56.7 million increase in other operating expenses. the increases were partially offset by a decrease in transaction and other non recurring expenses.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $136.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily attributable to $108.3 million in expenses related to acquired businesses and distributor to direct sales conversions, the unfavorable impact of increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

percentage of revenues           4.3   %           3.9   %           3.1   %
comparison of 2018 and 2017
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with our interventional urology, anesthesia and interventional product portfolios.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to expenses incurred by acquired businesses, primarily vascular solutions, and to a lesser extent, neotract. additionally, 2017 research and development expenses reflect increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments.
restructuring and impairment charges
2019 footprint realignment plan in february 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the "2019 footprint realignment plan"). these actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2022.
we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2019 footprint realignment plan of $56 million to $70 million, of which, we expect $21 million to $26 million to be incurred in 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be incurred prior to the end of 2021. we estimate that $53 million to $66 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which, $8 million to $9 million is expected to be made in 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be made by the end of 2021. additionally, we expect to incur $29 million to $35 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, of which, $18 million to $22 million is expected to be incurred during 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be incurred by the end of 2021.
we expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2021 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $12 million to $14 million once the plan is fully implemented.
anticipated charges and pre-tax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives in addition to the 2019 footprint realignment plan, we have ongoing restructuring programs related to (i) the integration of vascular solutions into teleflex; (ii) the centralization of certain administrative functions in our emea segment; (iii) the consolidation of our manufacturing operations (referred to as our 2018, 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans); and (iv) other restructuring programs designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. in addition, we have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment ("the oem initiative") that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance, but the activities should result in cost savings (we expect only minimal costs to be incurred). with respect to our restructuring programs and oem initiative, the table below summarizes (1) the estimated total charges that will be incurred and the estimated annual pre-tax savings once the programs are completed; (2) the charges incurred and estimated annual pre-tax savings realized through december 31, 2018; and (3) the estimated charges to be incurred and the estimated incremental annual pre-tax savings to be realized for these programs and oem initiative through december 31, 2018 and from january 1, 2019 through their respective anticipated completion dates. as used in the table, "pre-tax savings" include (1) anticipated cost savings with respect to our historical expense items and (2) anticipated efficiencies to be realized with respect to costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions.
estimated charges and pre-tax savings are subject to change based on, among other things, the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities, changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative, unanticipated expenditures and other developments, the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions, failure to realize anticipated savings from a supply contract related to a component included in certain kits sold by our vascular
38
north america and anesthesia north america segments, and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pre-tax savings. moreover, estimated pre-tax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve, among other things, assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management, which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty. it is likely that estimates of charges and pre-tax savings will change from time to time, and the table below reflects changes from amounts previously estimated. in addition, the table below does not include estimated charges and pre-tax savings related to completed programs.
pre-tax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations; such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pre-tax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations. for example, an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses, although likely increasing manufacturing costs, may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated.
restructuring programs and other similar cost saving initiatives estimated total                            through                  estimated remaining from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2018                                                 december 31, 2026

pre-tax savings (2)                       118 - 130   68                                                                                         50 - 62
total pre-tax savings                   $124 - $137                                $69                                                         $55 - $68
(1)   restructuring related charges represent costs that are directly related to the programs and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to the new locations, project management costs and accelerated depreciation, as well as a charge associated with our exit from facilities that is expected to be imposed by the taxing authority in the affected jurisdiction. most of these changes (other than the tax charge) are expected to be recognized in cost of goods sold.
(2)   approximately 70% of the pre-tax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold. as previously disclosed, during 2016, in connection with our execution of the 2014 footprint realignment plan, we implemented changes to medication delivery devices included in certain of our kits, which are expected to result in increased product costs (and therefore reduce the annual savings we anticipated at the inception of the program). however, we also expect to achieve improved pricing on these kits that will offset the increased costs, resulting in estimated annual increased revenues of $3 million to $4 million, which is not reflected in the table above. since 2017, we have realized an aggregate benefit of $2.4 million resulting from this incremental pricing. more recently, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits sold by our vascular north america and anesthesia north america operating segments. the agreement will result in increased development costs but is expected to reduce the cost of the component supply, once the supply becomes commercially available, as compared to the costs incurred with respect to our current suppliers. therefore, we anticipate a net savings from the agreement, which is reflected in the table above. see "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan" below for additional information.
the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our restructuring programs for which we incurred restructuring charges in 2018:
2018 footprint realignment plan on may 1, 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain european manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and related workforce reductions. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2018 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.
we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2018 footprint realignment plan of $102 million to $133 million, of which, we estimate that $99 million to $127 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur $19 million to $23 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, most of which we expect to be incurred by the end of 2021.
we began realizing plan-related savings in 2018 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $25 million to $30 million once the plan is fully implemented.
39
2016 footprint realignment plan in 2016, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations, the relocation and outsourcing of certain distribution operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities (the "2016 footprint realignment plan"). these actions commenced in the first quarter 2016 and were substantially completed by the end of 2018.
2014 footprint realignment plan in april 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan (the "2014 footprint realignment plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 footprint realignment plan of approximately $47 million to $52 million. additionally, we estimate that we will achieve annual pre-tax savings of $26 million to $29 million and we expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021.
2017 vascular solutions integration and emea restructuring programs during the first quarter 2017, the company committed to restructuring programs related to the integration of vascular solutions into teleflex and to the centralization of certain administrative functions in europe. both programs were substantially completed during 2018 and as a result, the company expects future restructuring expenses associated with the program, if any, to be nominal.
the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits.

comparison of 2018 and 2017
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding resulting from additional borrowings under our principal credit facility, as well as the november 2017 issuance of our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 ("2027 notes"). the increase in interest expense was also the result of a higher average interest rate on our debt.

comparison of 2017 and 2016
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding, mainly attributable to borrowings under our senior credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that were utilized to fund the vascular solutions and neotract acquisitions, offset by a slight decline in the average interest rate on debt.

we generate substantial earnings from our international operations. most of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had statutory tax rates that are lower than the united states statutory tax rate; as a result, our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2017 (excluding the impact of the tcja) and earlier years has been substantially below the united states statutory tax rate. the principal international jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2017 and earlier years is lower than the united states statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings include ireland, bermuda, luxembourg, germany and italy.
despite the tcja's reduction of the united states corporate income tax rate, we continue to have a consolidated effective income tax rate that is below the newly enacted statutory tax rate due to the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign operations in many of the relevant international jurisdictions. the principal international jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2018 is lower than the united states statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings include ireland and bermuda. however, changes to either the currently enacted united states tax rates or international statutory tax rates could affect our effective income tax rate in the future.
comparison of 2018 and 2017
the effective income tax rate for 2018 was 10.6% compared to 45.5% for 2017. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2018 were $23.2 million compared to $129.6 million in 2017. the effective income tax rate for 2018 was impacted by the reduction of the united states corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% as a result of the tcja. additionally, the effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a tax cost associated with a non-deductible contingent consideration expense recognized in connection with an increase in the fair value of the neotract contingent consideration liability. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
the effective income tax rate in 2017 was 45.5% compared to 3.3% in 2016. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2017 were $129.6 million compared to $8.1 million in 2016. the effective income tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net tax expense of $107.9 million resulting from the enactment of the tcja. the $107.9 million net tax
41
expense reflects a tax expense of $154.0 million for the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, partially offset by a $46.1 million tax benefit resulting from the reassessment and revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities. additionally, the effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the credit agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

of our $357.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018, $299.2 million was held at non-united states subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.
the tcja significantly changes u.s. tax law by, among other things, imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. previously, we were not taxed on foreign earnings deemed to be permanently invested overseas. under the tcja, we will have to pay $153.8 million over eight years for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, regardless of whether such earnings are actually repatriated, of which, we paid $12.6 million during 2018. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. as a result of the repatriation tax provisions of the tcja, we anticipate that, generally, we will be able to access cash located at our foreign subsidiaries without incurring any additional u.s. federal income tax liabilities. we are not aware of any other restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary.
we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs. however, as discussed above in "global economic conditions", although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly with respect to customers in greece, italy, portugal and spain, as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies. in december 2018, we sold $12.7 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy and portugal for $12.6 million.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our net trade accounts receivable from publicly funded hospitals in greece, italy, portugal and spain were $13.6 million and $24.7 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 6%, 6% and 7%, respectively, of our total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term trade accounts receivable with respect to these customers were outstanding were 121, 154 and 182 days, respectively. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, net current and long-term trade accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 11% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term trade accounts receivable. if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers' purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2019 and future years. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.
on october 4, 2018, we executed cross-currency swap agreements with six financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate. under the terms of the swap agreements, we notionally exchanged $500 million at an interest rate of 4.625% for €433.9 million at an interest rate of 1.942%. the swap agreements, which expire on october 4, 2023, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements. we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. as a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination date, between the u.s. dollar equivalent of the €433.9 million notional amount and the $500 million notional amount. if, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the u.s. dollar to euro currency exchange rate has declined by 10% from the rate in effect on october 4, 2018 (at that date, the exchange rate was 1.15 u.s. dollar per euro), we would be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately $50 million in respect of the notional settlement. the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. however, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with six different counterparties, all of whom are large, well-established financial institutions. based on the u.s. dollar to euro currency exchange rate in effect on october 4, 2018, and assuming exchange rates remain constant throughout the five year term of the swap agreements, we would realize a reduction in annual cash interest paid of $13.4 million.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.

comparison of 2018 and 2017
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $435.1 million during 2018 and $426.3 million during 2017. the $8.8 million increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2018 as compared to 2017 and a net unfavorable impact of changes in working capital. the net unfavorable impact from changes in working capital was due a net increase in inventories and a net increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.
the increase in inventories for 2018 was $37.2 million compared to an increase of $22.4 million for 2017. the net increase in inventories is attributable to higher inventory purchases associated with ongoing business growth, primarily within our interventional urology business. the increase in accounts receivable for 2018 was $23.4 million compared to an increase of $11.0 million for 2017. the net increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher net revenues during 2018 and a decrease in receivables outstanding sold during 2018 as compared to 2017. in december 2018, we sold $12.7 million of receivables outstanding with publicly funded hospitals in italy and portugal compared to 2017 when we sold $16.1 million of outstanding receivables related to public hospitals in italy. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities for 2018 was $63.4 million compared to an increase of $39.0 million for 2017. the increase is attributable to increased restructuring activity primarily related to the 2018 footprint realignment plan partially offset by lower payroll related accruals.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $196.4 million during 2018, which includes a cash outflow for payments related to the acquisition of businesses and intangible assets of $121.0 million and capital expenditures of $80.8 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was $206.4 million during 2018, which includes borrowing repayments of $128.5 million, contingent consideration payments of $73.2 million and dividend payments of $62.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from new borrowings of $35.0 million and share based compensation and related tax benefits of $22.7 million.
comparison of 2017 and 2016
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $426.3 million during 2017 and $410.6 million during 2016. the $15.7 million increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by a net cash outflow for income taxes resulting primarily from a tax refund received in 2016. excluding income taxes, the net impact of the working capital changes was consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016; an increase in inventories was
47
offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and to a lesser extent, a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. the increase in inventories for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $22.4 million compared to a decrease of $6.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase is attributable to inventory purchases to achieve desired safety stock levels as well as inventory from a former chinese distributor that was returned to us during 2017 in connection with the settlement of an arbitration proceeding between the distributor and us. the net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was $39.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to an increase of $15.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016; the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and benefit related accruals.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $1.8 billion during 2017, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion in payments for businesses acquired, principally vascular solutions and neotract; and capital expenditures of $70.9 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $6.3 million from the sale of two properties, one of which was a building that had been previously classified as held for sale.
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $1.1 billion during 2017, primarily resulting from a net increase in borrowings of $1.2 billion. our borrowings under the credit agreement included $1.0 billion to finance the vascular solutions acquisition, together with related fees and expenses, and $725 million to finance the neotract acquisition. in addition, we sold $500 million in principal amount of our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes"). these increases were partially offset by our repayments of 1.1 billion of borrowings under the credit agreement. additionally, we had a $136.1 million reduction in borrowings under the convertible notes resulting from exchange transactions, and payment upon maturity of all remaining convertible notes outstanding.
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was also impacted by dividend payments of $61.2 million and debt issuance and amendment fees of $26.7 million, which included fees paid in connection with our entry into the credit agreement, the issuance of the 2027 notes and a bridge facility and backstop commitment that was put in place to assist with the financing of the vascular solutions acquisition, but was never utilized because the required financing was provided under the credit agreement.

fixed rate debt comprised 52.8% and 50.7% of total debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings as of december 31, 2018 compared to the fixed rate borrowings as of december 31, 2017 is due a decrease in outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility resulting from debt repayments.
senior credit facility
48
on january 20, 2017, we amended and restated our then-existing senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement"). the credit agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $750.0 million. the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisitions of vascular solutions and, subsequently, neotract, as described above. the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantor's owned assets. the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20, 2022 and february 17, 2022, respectively. at december 31, 2018, we had $293.0 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately $2.1 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens, enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation, dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into swap agreements or enter into transactions with affiliates. additionally, the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio (generally, consolidated total funded indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, on the determination date to consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination) of not more than 4.50 to 1, a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (generally, consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, on the date of determination to consolidated ebitda for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination) of not more than 3.50 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement, paid in cash for such period) of not less than 3.50 to 1. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants of our senior credit facility.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the credit agreement.
2024, 2026 and 2027 senior notes as of december 31, 2018, the outstanding principal amount of our 5.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes") and the 2027 notes (collectively, the "senior notes") was $250.0, $400.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. the indentures governing the 2024 notes and 2026 notes contain covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock or other disqualified stock, create liens, merge, consolidate, or dispose of certain assets pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments, or enter into transactions with our affiliates. the indenture governing the 2027 notes contains covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes.
accounts receivable securitization we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2018, and 2017 we borrowed the maximum amount available of $50.0 million under this facility. this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred.

(1)   interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december 31, 2018.
(2)   purchase and other obligations are defined as unconditional commitments to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: quantities to be purchased; price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures (which, at the time we entered into the commitments, did not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business) and penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements; the amounts exclude operating lease obligations, which are addressed elsewhere in the table.
(3)   as permitted by the tcja, we have elected to pay the tax in annual installments over eight years.
we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of $10.7 million and $12.3 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made; as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $304.2 million and $272.1 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $136.9 million and $74.2 million, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration. we expect most of the current portion to be paid during the first quarter 2019 as result of the achievement of certain sales and regulatory goals. due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
see note 11, note 14, and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform
50
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable, after considering the company's historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.3 million and $10.3 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which constituted 2.4% and 2.8% of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years, we have procedures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  these procedures include monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  in addition, with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  to reduce risk exposures with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we have instituted procedures that include reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders. some of our customers, particularly in greece, italy, spain and portugal, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided, resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers. if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other, unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. when necessary, we adjust the reserves, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue, to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $18.1 million and $12.2 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31, 2018 within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability. the reduction in carrying value is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value.  factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
the adequacy of the reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.
51
our inventory reserve was $34.9 million and $35.6 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which represents 7.5% and 8.3% of gross inventories at those respective dates.
long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. for example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("ipr&d")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights and non-competition agreements) and are, generally, obtained through acquisition. intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill.
the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses, including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic conditions and estimating future cash flows. assumptions we use in our acquisition date fair value estimates and in our impairment evaluations include the discount rate and forecasted growth rates, which are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans, when applicable. we believe these assumptions and estimates are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. we have ten reporting units. in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the two-step quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board, the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be simplified, effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, subject to optional early adoption. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one
52
which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2018 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. moreover, changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.
no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2018.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and the quantitative impairment tests, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names and ipr&d is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the value of the hypothetical royalty, which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset.
53
management must estimate the volume of sales, hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset.  discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recognized a $16.9 million pre-tax ($8.6 million after tax) impairment charge related to the abandonment of certain intellectual property intangible assets. there were no impairment charges recorded for the year ended december 31, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a pre-tax ipr&d impairment charge of $41.0 million. see "restructuring and impairment charges" within "result of operations" above as well as note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on these charges.
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate         expected return on plan assets                          assumed healthcare trend rate
50 basis point increase         50 basis point decrease             50 basis point change                       1.0% increase          1.0% decrease
(dollars in millions)
net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense                $0.2                   $(0.3               )               $1.9                                          $0.1                 $(0.1         )
projected benefit obligation                                             $19.7                   $(17.0              )               n/a                                           $2.4                 $(2.2         )

share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. share based compensation expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $22.4 million, $19.4 million and $16.9 million, respectively.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the neotract acquisition and to our acquisition, in october 2018, of essential medical, inc., which
54
represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31, 2018, using a monte carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these acquisitions.) we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration. increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases may have the opposite effect. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities' fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we accrued $304.2 million and $272.1 million of contingent consideration, respectively.
income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the difficulties inherent in such assessments, judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions. as a result, we are at times subject to tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final united states and foreign tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $144.0 million and $104.8 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination in germany. the ultimate outcome of this examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.
as noted above, the tcja significantly changes u.s. tax law. as a result of the enactment of the tcja, our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended december 31, 2017, included provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2018, as permitted by sab 118, we recorded
55
adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the tcja included in our december 31, 2017 financial statements. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements.

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2018 were as follows:
•   we recorded revenues of $1.8 billion, or a 27.1% increase from $1.5 billion in the previous year, positively impacted by $2.0 million or 0.2% due to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.
•   income from operations grew 42.1% to $245.8 million from $172.9 million in 2017. expressed as a percentage of revenues, income from operations was 13.3% compared to 11.9% last year. the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily driven by an improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues as compared to the same period last year.
•   our effective tax rate was 3.8% compared to 58.3% last year. the provision for income taxes for 2018 was favorably impacted by the recognition of $26.0 million of net deferred tax assets resulting from the implementation of changes to our tax structure in response to u.s. tax reform. in 2017, our effective tax rate had increased principally due to the provisional $74.6 million charge related to u.s. tax reform.
•   net income increased 230.2% to $240.3 million compared to $72.8 million in 2017. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income increased 8.0% compared to last year, which was largely driven by the improved effective tax rate as well as the improvement in income from operations as a percentage of revenues.
•   diluted earnings per share increased 221.2% to $4.24 for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $1.32 in 2017.
•   cash provided by operations increased $99.4 million, or 51.5%, to $292.2 million during 2018 as compared to last year.

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report.
revenues - as discussed in note 1 "business and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k, we adopted the new accounting standard asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" (topic 606) as amended using the modified retrospective method. this resulted in different revenue recognition accounting policies applied to the years presented in our consolidated financial statements.
for the year ended december 31, 2018
we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract. consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation's relative standalone selling price. variable consideration usually takes the form of volume-based discounts, service level credits, price concessions or incentives. determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported.
we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements, which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. we generate the majority of our revenues under time-and-material contracts, which are billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer. we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed.
fixed-price contracts include maintenance and support arrangements, which may exceed one year in duration. maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period. fixed-price contracts also include application development arrangements, where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
revenues from licenses which have significant stand-alone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer. revenues from licenses which do not have stand-alone functionality are recognized over time.
28
if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less.
we report gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016
we recognized revenue when the following criteria were met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed; (2) delivery had occurred; (3) the sales price was fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability was reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria had been satisfied often involved assumptions and judgments that could have had a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenues reported.
we derived our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our it professionals. contracts for these services had different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which required management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition. fees for these contracts may have been in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. if there was uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services, revenue was deferred until the uncertainty was sufficiently resolved. at the time revenue was recognized, we provided for any contractual deductions and reduced revenue accordingly. the company reported gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
we deferred amounts billed to our customers for revenues not yet earned. such amounts were anticipated to be recorded as revenues when services were performed in subsequent periods. unbilled revenues was recorded when services had been provided but billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
the majority of our revenues (90.3% of revenues in 2017 and 88.2% in 2016) were generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues were recognized as services were performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues. the majority of such revenues were billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates as actual time was incurred on the project. revenues from fixed-price contracts (8.3% of revenues in 2017 and 10.4% in 2016) included fixed-price maintenance and support arrangements, which may have exceeded one year in duration and revenues from maintenance and support arrangements were generally recognized ratably over the expected service period. fixed-price contracts also included application development arrangements and revenues from these arrangements were primarily determined using the proportional performance method. in cases where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution was specified by the customer, and the acceptance criteria were not objectively determinable to have been met as the services were provided, revenues were deferred until all acceptance criteria had been met. in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue was recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the customer. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could have affected the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
business combinations - we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805, "business combinations." we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. the acquired assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, non-competition agreements, and assembled workforce and as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
29
goodwill and other intangible assets - we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 31, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a two-step process. the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. in performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of a reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
historically, a significant portion of the purchase consideration related to our acquisitions was allocated to customer relationships. in valuing customer relationships, we typically utilize the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only. we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives on a straight-line basis or, if reliably determinable, the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows. amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that predominantly range from five to ten years. we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. in assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
accounting for income taxes - we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. we estimate separately our deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the u.s. internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions.
the provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes.
the realizability of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. a reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. if the allowance is reversed in a future period, the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.
on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the u.s. tax act, which subjects a u.s. shareholder to taxes on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. the fasb staff q&a, topic 740, no. 5, "accounting for global intangible low-taxed income", states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we elected to provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred. this election did not have a material impact on the financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2018.
30
stock-based compensation - we recognize the cost of equity-settled stock-based incentive awards based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. the cost is expensed evenly over the service period. the service period is the period over which the employee performs the related services, which is normally the same as the vesting period. quarterly, the forfeiture assumption is adjusted and such adjustment may affect the timing of expense of the total amount recognized over the vesting period.
adjusting stock-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures requires judgment. if we change our assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. stock-based compensation expense in a period could be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures. if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unvested stock-based compensation expense.
equity-based awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period. future stock-based compensation expense related to our liability-classified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock, adding to the volatility in our operating results.
our adoption of asu 2016-09, "compensation - stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting," effective january 1, 2017, increased income tax expense volatility. our future operating results will be impacted by fluctuations in the stock price on the dates the awards vest or options are exercised and the magnitude of transactions occurring in each reporting period, among other factors.
effective january 1, 2018, we changed the methodology for estimating the volatility input used in the black-scholes option valuation model. prior to january 1, 2018, we estimated the volatility of our common stock by using the historical volatility of peer public companies including the company's historical volatility. in the first quarter of 2018, we began exclusively using our own historical volatility, as we believe this is a more accurate estimate of future volatility of the price of epam's common stock. we did not change the methodology for estimating any other black-scholes option valuation model assumptions as disclosed in note 12 "stock-based compensation" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 "business and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.

revenues we continue to expand our presence in multiple geographies and verticals, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2018, our total revenues grew 27.1% over the previous year to $1.8 billion. this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships. customer concentration continued to decrease with revenues from our top five, top ten and top twenty clients declining as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the previous year. revenue has been positively impacted from the acquisition of continuum innovation llc and think limited, which contributed 1.8% and 0.1%, respectively to our revenue growth, and by the fluctuations in foreign currency that increased our revenue growth by 0.2% during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the previous year.
we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical, customer location, service arrangement type, and customer concentration.
32
revenues by vertical our customers operate in five main industry verticals as well as in a number of verticals in which we are increasing our presence and label them as emerging verticals. emerging verticals include customers in other industries such as energy, utilities, manufacturing, auto, telecommunications and several others.

revenues by customer location our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets: north america, europe, cis and apac. we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers, but instead they are based on the location of the company's management responsible for a particular customer or market.

2018 compared to 2017
during the year ended december 31, 2018, revenues in our largest geography, north america, were $1,099.2 million growing $258.5 million, or 30.7%, from $840.7 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2017. revenues from this geography accounted for 59.6% of total revenues in 2018, an increase from 58.0% in the prior year. the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of $1,029.3 million in 2018 compared to $783.6 million in 2017.
33
revenues in our europe geography were $612.5 million, an increase of $101.2 million, or 19.8%, over $511.3 million in the previous year. revenues in this geography accounted for 33.2% of consolidated revenues in 2018 as compared to 35.2% in the previous year. the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom, switzerland and germany generating revenues of $200.9 million, $144.4 million and $80.8 million in 2018, respectively, compared to $189.0 million, $123.3 million and $60.2 million in 2017, respectively. revenues in the european geography were positively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the u.s. dollar, particularly the euro and the british pound, during 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
during 2018, revenues in the cis geography increased $13.3 million, or 19.5%, from the previous year. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers in russia, contributing $10.0 million of revenue growth in 2018 compared to the previous year. the revenues in the cis geography were negatively affected by currency fluctuations, primarily russian rubles, decreasing year-over-year growth of reported revenues in this geography by 9.7% in 2018.
revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 2.8% of total revenues in 2018, a level consistent with the prior year.
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, revenues in our largest geography, north america, were $840.7 million growing $170.1 million, or 25.4%, from $670.6 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2016. revenues from this geography accounted for 58.0% of total revenues in 2017, a level consistent with the prior year.
within north america, we experienced strong growth across all verticals with the business information & media vertical contributing 31.7% of total growth in the north america geography. in addition, our traditionally strong software & hi-tech portfolio grew 19.6% year over year. we saw continued growth in emerging verticals with 44.2% growth in revenues with 29.7% of the growth coming from customers who have been with us less than one year.
revenues in our europe geography were $511.3 million, an increase of $93.5 million, or 22.4% over $417.8 million in the prior year. revenues in this geography accounted for 35.2% of consolidated revenues in 2017 as compared to 36.0% in the prior year. europe experienced strong growth in the business information & media, life sciences & healthcare, and emerging verticals, each of which grew over 55% during 2017. over 70% of the growth in our europe geography in 2017 came from customers who have been with us less than two years. financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography accounting for 41.1% of the europe geography's revenues in 2017 as compared to 47.7% in 2016.
revenues in the cis geography increased $22.3 million, or 48.3%, from last year. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and emerging verticals. revenues in this geography benefited by $5.9 million from the appreciation of the russian ruble relative to the u.s. dollar.
revenues by customer concentration we have long-standing relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements. revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multi-year projects. while we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers, we continue to focus on diversification of our customer concentration and building up a portfolio of new accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential. we anticipate the contribution of these new accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid- to long-term and offset the potential slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature.

we expect customer concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the long-term. the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

revenues by service offering effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) as amended. the adoption of this standard required various disaggregated levels of revenue to be disclosed as presented in note 9 "revenues" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. the standard also required us to consider how management views the business and provide the appropriate disclosures that would be relevant and informative under those views.
our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. we are continually expanding our service capabilities, moving beyond traditional services into business consulting, design and physical product development. as more of our projects involve multiple competencies and different types of specialized professionals working collaboratively, it has been increasingly difficult to classify our projects into the specific service offerings that we historically presented. given the market demand for integrated customer solutions and our management's view of the business, we changed our presentation of service offerings to better reflect our business model.
our professional services engagement models vary based on the type of services provided to a customer, the mix and locations of professionals involved and pricing type, which is either time-and-material or fixed-price. historically, the majority of our professional services revenues have been generated under time-and-material contracts and we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future.

cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation expense, project-related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our revenue generating professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period. our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs.
we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects. some of our it professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services.
2018 compared to 2017
during the year ended december 31, 2018, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $1,186.9 million, representing an increase of 28.8% from $921.4 million reported last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an 18.1% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year and a higher level of accrued variable compensation.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 64.4% and 63.5% during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the year-over-year increase reflects a higher level of accrued variable compensation based on the stronger relative performance in 2018, the impact from lower utilization rates and increased stock compensation expense.
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $921.4 million, representing an increase of 25.0% from $737.2 million reported last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 15.0% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year as well as a 2.3% impact from appreciation of foreign currencies.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 63.5% and 63.6% during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our utilization in 2017 improved by 3.8% as compared to 2016 which was offset by higher compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of appreciation of the russian ruble, hungarian forint and polish zloty as compared to the u.s. dollar.
36
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business. these expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance, travel, legal and audit services, insurance, operating leases, including lease exit costs, advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus high-technologies park. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady as a percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
2018 compared to 2017
our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations, strategic business acquisitions, and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were $373.6 million, representing an increase of 14.0% as compared to $327.6 million reported last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018 was primarily driven by a $27.4 million increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses, and a $16.0 million increase in facilities and infrastructure related expenses to support our growth.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.3% to 20.3% for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily driven by the slower growth of 13.7% in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation expense as compared to revenue growth of 27.1%.
2017 compared to 2016
as a result of our expanding operations, acquisitions, and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth, our selling, general and administrative expenses have been increasing. during the year ended december 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses were $327.6 million, representing an increase of 23.2% as compared to $265.9 million reported in the prior year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 was driven by a $34.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses, and a $16.6 million increase in facility and infrastructure expenses to support the increased headcount.
expressed as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.3% to 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2017.
depreciation and amortization expense
2018 compared to 2017
during the year ended december 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization expense was $36.6 million, representing an increase of $8.1 million from $28.6 million reported last year. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth. depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
during the year ended december 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense was $28.6 million, representing an increase of $5.2 million from $23.4 million reported last year. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth. depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and employee housing loans, gains and losses from certain financial instruments, interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. there were no material changes in interest and other income, net in 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2016.

provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment. we consider factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future. these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items.
as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had $205.2 million, $180.9 million and $135.8 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest and penalty expense. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
in belarus, member technology companies of high-technologies park, including our subsidiary, have a full exemption from belarus income tax through january 2049. however, beginning february 1, 2018, the earnings of the company's belarus local subsidiary are subject to u. s. income taxation due to the company's decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary. consequently, there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to previous years. the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated $1.4 million, $15.5 million and $13.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated $0.02, $0.28 and $0.26 for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
2018 compared to 2017
the provision for income taxes was $9.5 million in 2018 and $101.5 million in 2017. the decrease in the effective tax rate from 58.3% in 2017 to 3.8% in 2018 was primarily due to a provisional one-time $74.6 million charge in 2017 as a result of the u.s. tax act and $30.0 million in one-time benefits in 2018 primarily resulting from our decision to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for u.s. income tax purposes as well as adjustments to the 2017 provisional charge.
the u.s. tax act significantly changed u.s. corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective january 1, 2018. this rate reduction yielded lower taxes on u.s. earnings in 2018, but was offset by u.s. tax imposed on foreign subsidiary earnings due to our decision to file entity classification elections with the internal revenue service for the majority of our foreign subsidiaries to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for u.s. income tax purposes. this change subjects the income of the disregarded foreign subsidiaries to u.s. income taxation and reduces the impact of new taxes under the u.s. tax act on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related party payments, which are referred to as gilti and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("beat"), respectively. a one-time tax benefit of $26.0 million was recorded to reflect the establishment of net deferred tax assets as a result of the entity classification elections.
the one-time $74.6 million charge in 2017 was comprised of a $64.3 million provisional charge due to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax as well as a $10.3 million provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the u.s. tax act. the provisional charge due to the one-time transition tax was reduced in 2018 to a final charge of $59.4 million. this tax reduction resulted in a $4.9 million tax benefit in 2018. the provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the u.s. statutory tax rate on the valuation of the net deferred tax assets was increased to a final charge of $11.2 million, which resulted in a $0.9 million tax charge in 2018.

in 2017, we reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the u.s. tax act and determined $97.0 million of our accumulated earnings in belarus were no longer indefinitely reinvested. as a result, we recorded a charge of $4.9 million in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the withholding tax payable to belarus when the earnings are distributed. based on proposed tax regulations issued by the u.s. treasury department during 2018, it was determined that a u.s. foreign tax credit could be claimed for the withholding tax paid to belarus resulting in a net $4.9 million tax benefit recognized in 2018. this $4.9 million tax charge in 2017 and offsetting benefit in 2018 also contributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018.
excess tax benefits associated with equity award exercises and vesting were $17.4 million in 2018 and $9.3 million in 2017. due to the entity classification elections for u.s. tax purposes, the benefit from the equity awards to employees outside the u.s. contributed to the increase in excess tax benefits for 2018 and also contributed to the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018.
2017 compared to 2016
the provision for income taxes was $101.5 million in 2017 and $27.2 million in 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate from 21.5% in 2016 to 58.3% in 2017 was primarily due to the provisional $74.6 million charge as a result of the u.s. tax act. the u.s. tax act significantly changed u.s. corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective january 1, 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax. in addition, the u.s. tax act created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. the charge was comprised of a $64.3 million provisional charge due to the one-time transition tax as well as a $10.3 million provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the u.s. tax act.
in 2017, we also reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the u.s. tax act and determined $97.0 million of our accumulated earnings in belarus are no longer indefinitely reinvested. as a result, we recorded a charge of $4.9 million in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31, 2017 for the withholding tax payable to belarus when the earnings are distributed.
these charges were partially offset by the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 whereby excess tax benefits of $9.3 million were recognized for the year ended december 31, 2017 in the income tax provision rather than additional paid-in-capital.
other factors impacting our effective tax rate include changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates as well as small decreases in statutory tax rates in hungary, ukraine and the united kingdom.

results by business segment our operations consist of three reportable segments: north america, europe, and russia. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and operating profit. segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. such expenses include certain types of professional fees, non-corporate taxes, compensation to non-employee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses, including compensation of specific groups of non-production employees. in addition, the company does not allocate amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill and other asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time charges. these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations.
39
we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for its client base and market. as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some cases, managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam's senior management team. in such cases, the customer's activity would be reported through the management team's reportable segment.
segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company began to allocate certain staff recruitment and development expenses into segment operating profit as these expenses became part of the evaluation of segment management's performance. these costs were previously not allocated to segments and were included in unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated income before provision for income taxes. the effect of this reclassification was not material to segment operating profit and had no impact on total income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018.

operating profits of our russia segment decreased $2.5 million when compared to 2017. expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues, the segment's operating profits were 15.6% and 22.1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. the depreciation of the russian ruble against the u.s. dollar during 2018 as compared to 2017 significantly impacted the revenues in this segment, which were not similarly offset with the costs due to realized losses on our foreign currency hedges. currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment. ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues in this geography. we continue to monitor geopolitical forces, economic and trade sanctions, and other issues involving this region.
2017 compared to 2016
revenues from our russia segment increased $19.4 million relative to 2016. operating profits of our russia segment increased $6.4 million when compared to 2016. expressed as a percentage of revenues, the russia segment's operating profits were 22.1% and 17.3% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. this growth is partially attributable to the strengthening of the russian ruble against the u.s. dollar during 2017 as compared to 2016. ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in this region as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble impact this segment.
effects of inflation economies in some countries where we operate, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan, ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages. while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant.

liquidity and capital resources capital resources our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business. as of december 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $770.6 million and $274.6 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and as of december 31, 2018, all cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating needs and we have no intention of repatriating those funds. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor our mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances and we may decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states in the future. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repatriated $167.5 million of cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to the united states. if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends in the future, $242.8 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes. we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic operations and obligations for the foreseeable future.
we have cash in banks in belarus, russia, ukraine, kazakhstan and armenia, where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability, banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets, and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured. as of december 31, 2018, the total amount of cash held in these countries was $179.5 million and of this amount, $119.7 million was located in belarus.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $274.6 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and our outstanding debt of $25.0 million represents the minimal required borrowing to keep the credit facility active. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future. see note 8 "long-term debt" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding our long-term debt.
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility.

operating activities

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2018 increased $99.4 million, or 51.5%, to $292.2 million, as compared to 2017 primarily driven by the $167.5 million increase in net income and 8 day improvement in days sales outstanding partially offset by the payout of a higher level of variable compensation related to 2017 performance and a non-cash increase in net deferred tax assets of $26.0 million as a result of our decision to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for u.s. income tax purposes.
2017 compared to 2016
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $25.6 million, or 15.3%, to $192.8 million, as compared to 2016 primarily driven by the $39.3 million increase in income from operations. the $74.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes had minimal impact on cash flow as it was offset by a $70.5 million increase in taxes payable primarily attributable to the u.s. tax act, which are expected to be paid over the next 8 years.

(1)   the u.s. tax act transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings is payable over eight years. see note 7 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   we estimate our future obligations for long-term incentive plan payouts by assuming the closing price per share of our common stock at december 31, 2018 remains constant into the future. this is an estimate as actual prices will vary over time.
(3)   our future obligations related to the 2017 credit facility consist of principal, interest and fees for the unused balance. we assume the floating interest rate in effect at december 31, 2018 will remain constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual rates will vary over time. in addition, for the 2017 credit facility, we assume that the balance outstanding and the unused balance as of december 31, 2018 remain the same through the remaining term of the agreement. the actual respective balances under our 2017 credit facility may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on the business decisions of management.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. in addition, we had recorded $7.5 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2018 related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments.
letters of credit at december 31, 2018, we had one irrevocable standby letter of credit totaling $0.4 million under the 2017 credit facility, which is required to secure commitments for office rent. the letter of credit expires on august 2, 2019 with a possibility of extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. however, our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 14 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
the following is managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of certain significant factors that have affected fifth third bancorps (the bancorp or fifth third) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements, which are a part of this filing. reference to the bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. the bancorps banking subsidiary is referred to as the bank.
overview this overview of md&a highlights selected information in the financial results of the bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. for a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. each of these items could have an impact on the bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, refer to the glossary of abbreviations and acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on form 10-k. the abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this md&a, as well as the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.
net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in md&a on an fte basis. the fte basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. the bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. the fte basis for presenting net interest income is a non-gaap measure. for further information, refer to the non-gaap financial measures section of md&a.
the bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. for the year ended december 31, 2018, net interest income on an fte basis and noninterest income provided 60% and 40% of total revenue, respectively. the bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the u.s. from customers domiciled in the u.s. revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the bancorp. as discussed later in the risk management section of md&a, risk identification, assessment, management, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the bancorp.
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. generally, the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral.
noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, wealth and asset management revenue, corporate banking revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, net securities gains or losses and other noninterest income. noninterest expense includes personnel costs, net occupancy expense, technology and communication costs, card and processing expense, equipment expense and other noninterest expense.
worldpay, inc. and worldpay holding, llc transactions on january 16, 2018, vantiv, inc. completed its previously announced acquisition of worldpay group plc. with the resulting combined company named worldpay, inc. as a result of this transaction, the bancorp recognized a gain of $414 million in other noninterest income during the first quarter of 2018 associated with the dilution in its ownership interest in worldpay holding, llc from approximately 8.6% to approximately 4.9%.
on june 27, 2018, the bancorp completed the sale of 5 million shares of class a common stock of worldpay, inc. the bancorp had previously received these class a shares in exchange for class b units of worldpay holding, llc. the bancorp recognized a gain of $205 million related to the sale. as a result of the sale, the bancorp beneficially owns approximately 3.3% of worldpays equity through its ownership of approximately 10.3 million class b units. at december 31, 2018, the bancorps remaining interest in worldpay holding, llc of $420 million continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment given the nature of worldpay holding, llcs structure as a limited liability company and contractual arrangements between worldpay holding, llc and the bancorp.
gs holdings transaction in may 2018, greensky, inc. launched an ipo and issued 38 million shares of class a common stock for a valuation of $23 per share. in connection with this ipo, the bancorps investment in greensky, llc, which was comprised of 252,550 membership units, was converted to 2,525,498 units of the newly formed greensky holdings, llc (gs holdings), representing a 1.4% interest in gs holdings. the bancorps units in gs holdings are exchangeable on a one-to-one basis for class a common stock or cash.
at the time of the ipo, the bancorp recognized a $16 million gain on its investment in greensky, llc, which was included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2018, the investment in gs holdings was $24 million, which was included in equity securities in the consolidated balance sheets.

2018 branch optimization plan customer interactions and service and sales activity in branch banking continue to evolve with changing demographics and technology applications. customers are increasingly utilizing digital tools to interact with their financial institutions in conducting their transactions while still utilizing physical branches for consultations and new product and service initiation. during the past three years, these developments and other business strategies led to a net decrease of 133 in the number of retail branches, or 11% of the bancorps total branch count, through consolidations and sales.
the bancorp continues to evaluate its retail network distribution in light of changes in customer behavior while developing new analytical tools that provide enhanced capabilities to optimize the profitability and growth potential of branches. in slower growth mature markets these developments enable the bancorp to achieve efficiencies through well-executed branch consolidations without materially impacting deposit flows and/or revenue growth while maintaining the service quality standards. while continuing to evaluate such actions, the bancorp is also focused on achieving higher retail household and deposit growth in other parts of its footprint  mainly in markets that exhibit faster economic growth and where the bancorp has significant opportunities to capture higher market share. to that extent, based on the strategic business evaluation that was performed during the second quarter of 2018, over the next 2-3 years, as part of the 2018 branch optimization plan, the bancorp plans to close between 100-125 branches in more mature markets and open between 100-125 new branches in higher growth markets where the bancorp already has an existing retail branch presence. with the existing local presence and familiarity with the customer demographics, and with newly developed analytical tools, the bancorp expects to achieve higher growth rates as a result of these actions.
as of december 31, 2018, the bancorp had closed 31 branches under the 2018 branch optimization plan. the bancorp expects to identify the remaining branches to be closed under the 2018 branch optimization plan prior to december 31, 2019. as part of the adoption of the 2018 branch optimization plan, the bancorp has also elected to sell 21 parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion. for further information about the 2018 branch optimization plan, refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
change in accounting policy effective in the fourth quarter of 2018, the bancorp changed its accounting policy for qualifying lihtc investments from the equity method to the proportional amortization method as it was managements determination to be the preferable method.
45  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the proportional amortization method provides an improved presentation for the reporting of these investments by presenting the investment performance net of taxes as a component of income tax expense, which more fairly represents the economics and provides users with a better understanding of the returns from such investments than the prior equity method. additionally, the proportional amortization method has been elected as a preferred accounting method for lihtc investments by many of the bancorps peers. changing the accounting policy for lihtc investments from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method will make the bancorps presentation of the lihtc investments comparable to that of its peers. the adoption of the proportional amortization method was applied retrospectively and resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $134 million as of january 1, 2016. unless otherwise noted, all prior period information has been restated to conform to the accounting policy change. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information including the impact of adoption on prior period financial statements.

earnings summary the bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $2.1 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. the bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $2.1 billion, or $2.81 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends.
net interest income on an fte basis (non-gaap) was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net interest income was positively impacted by increases in yields on average loans and leases and average taxable securities and an increase in average taxable securities for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the fomc to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in december 2017, march 2018, june 2018, september 2018 and december 2018. these positive impacts were partially offset by increases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. net interest margin on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 3.22% and 3.03% for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
noninterest income decreased $434 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by increases in corporate banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue and card and processing revenue. other noninterest income decreased $470 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the gain on sale of worldpay, inc. shares recognized in the prior year, a reduction in equity method income from the bancorps interest in worldpay holding, llc, the impact of the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and income from the tra associated with worldpay, inc. recognized in the prior year. these reductions were partially offset by the gain related to vantiv, inc.s acquisition of worldpay group plc., an increase in private equity investment income, as well as a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares. corporate banking revenue increased $85 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in lease remarketing fees, institutional sales revenue, syndication fees and contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. wealth and asset management revenue increased $25 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in private client service fees and brokerage fees. card and processing revenue increased $16 million from the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to increases in the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume.
noninterest expense increased $146 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in personnel costs and technology and communications expenses, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. personnel costs increased $126 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by increases in base compensation, performance-based compensation and severance costs. the increase in base compensation was primarily due to an increase in the bancorps minimum wage as a result of benefits received from the tcja and personnel additions associated with strategic investments and acquisitions.
46  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations technology and communications expense increased $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven primarily by increased investment in regulatory, compliance and growth initiatives. other noninterest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments, gains on partnership investments and decreases in professional service fees and fdic insurance and other taxes, partially offset by increases in marketing expense and loan and lease expense.

credit summary the provision for loan and lease losses was $237 million and $261 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.35% during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 0.32% during the year ended december 31, 2017. at december 31, 2018, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and oreo decreased to 0.41% compared to 0.53% at december 31, 2017. for further discussion on credit quality, refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a.
capital summary the bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the pca requirements of the u.s. banking agencies. as of december 31, 2018, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, the cet1 capital ratio was 10.24%, the tier i risk-based capital ratio was 11.32%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 14.48% and the tier i leverage ratio was 9.72%.
non-gaap financial measures the following are non-gaap measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the consolidated financial statements but should be supplemental to primary u.s. gaap measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary u.s. gaap measures.
the fte basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. the bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

the bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under u.s. gaap, and therefore is considered a non-gaap financial measure. this measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

the bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the u.s. banking agencies. these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the u.s. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. because u.s. gaap does not include capital ratio measures, the bancorp believes there are no comparable u.s. gaap financial measures to these ratios. these ratios are not formally defined by u.s. gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-gaap financial measures. the bancorp encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

48  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting standards note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the bancorp during 2018 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.
critical accounting policies the bancorps consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the bancorps financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the alll, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. there have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended december 31, 2018.
alll the bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the alll. the bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. the bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. for an analysis of the bancorps alll by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. the alll is maintained at a level the bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll. provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. the bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.
the bancorps methodology for determining the alll requires significant management judgment and is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a tdr and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. allowances on individual commercial loans, tdrs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.
larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a tdr, are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. when individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the bancorp. allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. the bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.
historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. the loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. the risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.
homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends, refreshed fico score trends and product mix.
the bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the alll. these include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
when evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the bancorps customers. refer to the allowance for credit losses subsection of the risk management section of md&a for a discussion on the bancorps alll sensitivity analysis.
reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the bancorps alll, as previously discussed. net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
49  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. the bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. the bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.
changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and regulations and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. these changes may significantly impact the bancorps tax accruals, deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the bancorp.
deferred taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. where management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. for additional information on income taxes, refer to note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
valuation of servicing rights when the bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. the bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. upon this election, all servicing rights in these classes are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. servicing rights are valued using internal oas models. significant management judgment is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the oas spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. the primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. in order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal oas model. prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. servicing rights were assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. for additional information on servicing rights, refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.
u.s. gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. for additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the bancorp on a quarterly basis. additionally, the bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. the level of management judgment necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (level 1) require minimal judgment. the valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgment to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets and the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. table 6 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using level 3 inputs.

goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. u.s. gaap requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the bancorp is september 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.
impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. in testing goodwill for impairment, u.s. gaap permits the bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the bancorp, the performance of the bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the bancorp would be required to perform the first step (step 1) of the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. as none of the bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the bancorps stock price. the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. the bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. additionally, the bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.
when required to perform step 2, the bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. a recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.
during step 2, the bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. significant management judgment is necessary in the identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting units recorded assets and liabilities. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. this assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. the bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as a result of this assignment process. refer to note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the bancorps goodwill.
legal contingencies the bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. the bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. an accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. refer to note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the bancorps legal proceedings.
51  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements of income analysis net interest income net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.
tables 7 and 8 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities included in average other assets.
net interest income on an fte basis (non-gaap) was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net interest income was positively impacted by increases in yields on average loans and leases of 58 bps and yields on average taxable securities of 13 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. net interest income also benefited from an increase in average taxable securities of $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the fomc to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in december 2017, march 2018, june 2018, september 2018 and december 2018. these positive impacts were partially offset by increases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt increased 33 bps and 32 bps, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
net interest rate spread on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 2.87% during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2.76% during the year ended december 31, 2017. yields on average interest-earning assets increased 46 bps, partially offset by a 35 bps increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
net interest margin on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 3.22% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 3.03% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread partially offset by a decrease in average free funding balances. the decrease in average free funding balances was driven by a decrease in average demand deposits of $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
interest income on an fte basis from loans and leases (non-gaap) increased $590 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by the previously mentioned increase in yields on average loans and leases, as well as an increase in the volume of average other consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans. for more information on the bancorps loan and lease portfolio, refer to the loans and leases subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a. interest income from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $94 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases in average taxable securities and yields on average taxable securities.
interest expense on core deposits increased $250 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 70 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 37 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to increases in the rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. refer to the deposits subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a for additional information on the bancorps deposits.
interest expense on wholesale funding increased $102 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt coupled with an increase in average long-term debt. refer to the borrowings subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a for additional information on the bancorps borrowings. average wholesale funding represented 23% and 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. for more information on the bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the market risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a.

provision for loan and lease losses the bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the critical accounting policies section of md&a. the provision is recorded to bring the alll to a level deemed appropriate by the bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the alll. the amount of loans and leases actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets is referred to as a charge-off. net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.
the provision for loan and lease losses was $237 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $261 million for the same period in the prior year. the decrease in provision expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets combined with overall improved credit quality, partially offset by an increase in outstanding commercial loan balances and an increase in consumer reserve rates for certain products. the alll declined $93 million from december 31, 2017 to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2018, the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.16%, compared to 1.30% at december 31, 2017.
refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a as well as note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the alll.

service charges on deposits service charges on deposits decreased $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $13 million in commercial deposit fees, partially offset by an increase of $8 million in consumer deposit fees.
wealth and asset management revenue wealth and asset management revenue increased $25 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase from the prior year was primarily due to increases of $16 million and $10 million, respectively, in private client service fees and brokerage fees. these increases were driven by an increase in average assets under management as a result of market performance and increased asset inflows during the year ended december 31, 2018. the bancorps trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $356 billion and $362 billion in total assets under care as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and managed $37 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017.
corporate banking revenue corporate banking revenue increased $85 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31,

net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment increased $43 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. this increase was driven by the impact of impairment charges of $45 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $7 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. for more information, refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
private equity investment income increased $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to valuation adjustments on certain private equity investments. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $59 million related to the visa total return swap compared to negative valuation adjustments of $80 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease from the prior period was primarily attributable to the impact of litigation developments during 2017. for additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares, refer to note 16, note 17 and note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments increased $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to overall improved credit quality. gains on partnership investments were $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to losses of $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. professional service fees decreased $16 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to decreases in legal and consulting fees. fdic insurance and other taxes decreased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. marketing expense increased $33 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to promotional offers during the year ended december 31, 2018. loan and lease expense increased $10 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by an increase in loan servicing expenses on point-of-sale loans as a result of growth in point-of-sale originations.
applicable income taxes applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying lihtc investments and certain nondeductible expenses. the tax credits are associated with the low-income housing tax credit program established under section 42 of the irc, the new markets tax credit program established under section 45d of the irc, the rehabilitation investment tax credit program established under section 47 of the irc and the qualified zone academy bond program established under section 1397e of the irc.
the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily impacted by $189 million and $206 million, respectively, of low-income housing tax credits and other tax benefits and $23 million and $34 million of tax benefits from tax exempt income in 2018 and 2017, respectively and were partially offset by $154 million and $223 million of proportional amortization related to qualifying lihtc investments. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 was also impacted by a $253 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for years beginning after december 31, 2017. the decrease in the effective tax rate from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes mentioned above, partially offset by the impact of an increase in income before taxes.
the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the tcja, on december 22, 2017. the tcja made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. u.s. gaap requires the bancorp to recognize the tax effects of changes in tax laws and rates on its deferred taxes in the period in which the law is enacted. as a result, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $253 million. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp was subject to a federal statutory corporate tax rate of 35 percent. for years beginning after december 31, 2017, the bancorp is subject to a federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent.
for stock-based awards, u.s. gaap requires that the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the bancorps actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. the bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. based on its stock price at december 31, 2018, the bancorp estimates that it may be necessary to recognize $6 million of additional income tax benefit over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards, primarily in the first half of 2019. however, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the bancorps stock price and the number of sars exercised by employees.

59  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment review the bancorp reports on four business segments: commercial banking, branch banking, consumer lending and wealth and asset management. additional information on each business segment is included in note 29 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change.
the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. by employing an ftp methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of the cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other. the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve, which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. the ftp curve is constructed using the u.s. swap curve, brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing.
the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. the credit rates for several deposit products were reset january 1, 2018 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. these rates were generally higher than those in place during 2017, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2018. ftp charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. as overall market rates increased, the ftp charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2018.
the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for loan and lease losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. provision for loan and lease losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other. the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.
the results of operations and financial position for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to reflect changes in internal expense allocation methodologies as well as a change in accounting policy for qualifying lihtc investments.

comparison of the year ended 2018 with 2017
net income was $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to net income of $827 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in net income was driven by increases in noninterest income and net interest income on an fte basis and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
net interest income on an fte basis increased $51 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily driven by increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases and increases in ftp credits on interest checking deposits. these increases were partially offset by increases in ftp charge rates on loans and leases, increases in the rates paid on core deposits and decreases in ftp credits on demand deposits driven by lower average balances.
provision for loan and lease losses decreased $64 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily driven by a decrease in commercial criticized asset levels partially offset by an increase in net charge-offs. net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 18 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 19 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017.
noninterest income increased $79 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase in corporate banking revenue and other noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposits. corporate banking revenue increased $84 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by increases in lease remarketing fees, institutional sales revenue, syndication fees, contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives and foreign exchange fees partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and business lending fees. the increase in lease remarketing fees for the year ended december 31, 2018 included the impact of $52 million of impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets that were recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. other noninterest income increased $9 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in private equity investment income. service charges on deposits decreased $14 million from the year ended december 31, 2017.
noninterest expense increased $29 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 due to an increase in personnel costs partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. personnel costs increased $50 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increased incentive compensation and base compensation. other noninterest expense decreased $21 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the impact of gains and losses on partnership investments and decreases in operating lease expense and consulting expense partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead allocations.
average commercial loans increased $1.0 billion from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans partially offset by decreases in average commercial leases and average commercial mortgage loans. average commercial and industrial loans increased $973 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 as a result of an increase in loan originations, a decrease in payoffs and an increase in drawn balances on existing revolving lines of credit. average commercial construction loans increased $404 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in draw levels on existing commitments.
61  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average commercial leases decreased $218 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship based lease originations. average commercial mortgage loans decreased $154 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 due to an increase in paydowns in the fourth quarter of 2017 and lower loan origination activity through the first two quarters of 2018.
average core deposits decreased $1.1 billion from the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease was driven by decreases in average demand deposits of $3.0 billion and average savings and money market deposits of $1.2 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to lower average balances per account. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in average interest checking deposits of $3.1 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to balance migration from demand deposit accounts and an increase in average balances per commercial customer account as well as the acquisition of new commercial customers.
comparison of the year ended 2017 with 2016
net income was $827 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to net income of $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease in net income was driven by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses.
net interest income on an fte basis decreased $161 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily driven by increases in ftp charge rates on loans and leases and increases in the rates paid of core deposits. the decrease in net interest income was partially offset by increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases of 37 bps from the year ended december 31, 2016.
provision for loan and lease losses decreased $38 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans partially offset by a reduction in the benefit from commercial criticized assets. net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 19 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 33 bps for the year ended december 31, 2016.

noninterest expense increased $6 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations partially offset by decreases in losses on partnership investments.
average commercial loans decreased $854 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by an increase in average commercial construction loans. average commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.7 billion from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily as a result of deliberate exits from certain loans that did not meet the bancorps risk-adjusted profitability targets and softer loan demand. average commercial construction loans increased $725 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in demand and draw levels on existing commitments.
average core deposits decreased $2.2 billion from the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily driven by decreases in average savings and money market deposits and average demand deposits which decreased $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to lower average balances per account. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in average interest checking deposits of $498 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of new customers.

comparison of the year ended 2017 with 2016

the provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $261 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $343 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets, which reflected improvement in the national economy and stabilization of commodity prices, and a decrease in outstanding loan balances. net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.32% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 0.39% for the year ended december 31, 2016.
net interest income on an fte basis (non-gaap) was $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. net interest income was positively impacted by an increase in yields on average loans and leases, an increase in average taxable securities and a decrease in average long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the fomc to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in december 2016, march 2017, june 2017 and december 2017. these positive impacts were partially offset by a decrease in average loans and leases and increases in the rates paid on average other short-term borrowings, average long-term debt and average interest-bearing core deposits for the year ended december 31, 2017. net interest margin on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 3.03% and 2.88% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
noninterest income increased $528 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. other noninterest income increased $669 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of worldpay, inc. shares, an increase in private equity investment income and the impact of the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment for the year ended december 31, 2016. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of certain transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 which included the impact of income from the tra transactions associated with worldpay, inc., positive valuation adjustments and the gain on sale of the warrant associated with worldpay holding, llc and gains on the sales of certain retail branch operations.

noninterest expense increased $22 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in personnel costs and technology and communications expense, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. personnel costs increased $38 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 driven by increases in base compensation, medical and fica expenses and long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in severance costs related to the bancorps voluntary early retirement program in 2016. the increase in personnel costs also included the impact of one-time employee bonuses that the bancorp paid as a result of benefits received from the tcja. technology and communication expense increased $11 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to increased investment in regulatory, compliance and growth initiatives. other noninterest expense decreased $19 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and losses on partnership investments, partially offset by increases in professional service fees and marketing expense.

total average loans and leases increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, from december 31, 2017 as a result of a $1.1 billion, or 2%, increase in average commercial loans and leases and a $34 million increase in average consumer loans.
average commercial loans and leases increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in average commercial leases and average commercial mortgage loans.
72  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average commercial and industrial loans increased $1.1 billion, or 3%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in loan originations, a decrease in payoffs and an increase in drawn balances on existing revolving lines of credit. average commercial construction loans increased $419 million, or 10%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in draw levels on existing commitments. average commercial leases decreased $216 million, or 5%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship based lease originations. average commercial mortgage loans decreased $183 million, or 3%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in paydowns in the fourth quarter of 2017 and lower loan origination activity through the first two quarters of 2018.
average consumer loans increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in other consumer loans, credit card and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and automobile loans. average other consumer loans increased $889 million, or 88%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in point-of-sale loan originations. average credit card increased $139 million, or 6%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in balance active customers and an increase in card usage resulting in an increase in the average balance per active customer. average residential mortgage loans increased $97 million, or 1%, from december 31, 2017 primarily driven by the continued retention of certain agency conforming arms and certain other fixed-rate loans. average home equity decreased $677 million, or 9%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. average automobile loans decreased $414 million, or 4%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns.
investment securities the bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity to satisfy regulatory requirements. total investment securities were $33.6 billion and $32.7 billion at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. the taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.0 years at december 31, 2018 compared to 4.7 years at december 31, 2017.
debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. at december 31, 2018, the bancorps investment portfolio consisted primarily of aaa-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. the bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both december 31, 2018 and 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2018 the bancorp did not recognize any otti on its available-for-sale debt and other securities. for the year ended december 31, 2017 the bancorp recognized $54 million of otti on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the consolidated statements of income. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and evaluating securities in an unrealized loss position for otti.

73  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by decreases in asset-backed securities and other debt securities.
on an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 25% of total interest-earning assets at both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017. the estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 6.5 years at both december 31, 2018 and 2017. in addition, at december 31, 2018 and 2017 the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.25% and 3.18%, respectively.
trading debt securities decreased $205 million from december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities.
information presented in table 25 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. yield information is presented on an fte basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $298 million at december 31, 2018 compared to net unrealized gains of $174 million at december 31, 2017. the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads expand.

total borrowings decreased $2.2 billion, or 11%, from december 31, 2017 due to decreases in other short-term borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in federal funds purchased. other short-term borrowings decreased $3.4 billion from december 31, 2017 driven by a decrease in fhlb advances. the level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. for further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. long-term debt decreased $478 million from december 31, 2017 primarily driven by the maturity of $1.9 billion of unsecured senior bank notes and $500 million of unsecured subordinated debt, $480 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations and $44 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt during the year ended december 31, 2018. these decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of unsecured fixed-rate senior bank notes, $650 million of unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, $300 million of unsecured floating-rate senior bank notes and $250 million of unsecured floating-rate senior notes since december 31, 2017. for additional information regarding long-term debt issuances, refer to note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. federal funds purchased increased $1.8 billion from december 31, 2017 due to a reallocation of other short-term borrowings. for further information on subsequent events related to long-term debt, refer to note 31 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

total average borrowings increased $152 million, or 1%, compared to december 31, 2017, due to increases in average federal funds purchased and average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in average other short-term borrowings. average federal funds purchased increased $952 million due to a reallocation of other short-term borrowings.
76  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average long-term debt increased $747 million compared to december 31, 2017. the increase was driven primarily by the issuances of long-term debt during the second half of 2017 which consisted of $750 million of unsecured fixed-rate senior bank notes and $300 million of unsecured floating-rate senior bank notes and the issuances during the year ended december 31, 2018, as discussed above. the increase was partially offset by the maturities of unsecured senior bank notes and subordinated debt and paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations, as discussed above, during the year ended december 31, 2018. average other short-term borrowings decreased $1.5 billion compared to december 31, 2017, driven primarily by the aforementioned decrease in fhlb advances. information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the net interest income subsection of the statements of income analysis section of md&a. in addition, refer to the liquidity risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the bancorps liquidity management.
77  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management - overview risk management is critical for effectively serving customers financial needs while protecting the bancorp and achieving strategic goals. it is also essential to reducing the volatility of earnings and safeguarding the bancorps brand and reputation. further, risk management is integral to the bancorps strategic and capital planning processes. it is essential that the bancorps business strategies consistently align to its overall risk appetite and capital considerations. maintaining risks within the bancorps risk appetite requires that risks are understood by all employees across the enterprise, and appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place to limit risk to within the risk appetite. to achieve this, the bancorp implements a framework for managing risk that encompasses business as usual activities and the utilization of a risk process for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.
fifth third uses a structure consisting of three lines of defense in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities for effective risk management.
the risk taking functions within the lines of business comprise the first line of defense. the first line of defense originates risk through normal business as usual activities; therefore, it is essential that they monitor, assess and manage the risks being taken, implement controls necessary to mitigate those risks and take responsibility for managing their business within the bancorps risk appetite.
control functions, such as the risk management organization, are the second line of defense and are responsible for providing challenge, oversight and governance of activities performed by the first line.
the audit division is the third line of defense and provides an independent assessment of the bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes. the credit risk review division provides an independent assessment of credit risk, which includes evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs.
fifth thirds core values and culture provide a foundation for supporting sound risk management practices by setting expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization.
all employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with fifth thirds core values and code of business conduct & ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. fifth thirds corporate responsibility and reputation committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees across the first, second and third lines of defense and is a foundational element of fifth thirds culture.
below are the bancorps core principles of risk management that are used to ensure the bancorp is operating in a safe and sound manner:
●   understand the risks taken as a necessary part of business; however, the bancorp ensures risks taken are in alignment with its strategy and risk appetite.

●   provide transparency and escalate risks and issues as necessary.

●            ensure fifth thirds products and services are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to its customers and to fifth third, and that potential opportunities remain aligned to the core customer base.

●   avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed and monitored.

●   act with integrity in all activities.

●   focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet customers needs.

●   maintain a strong financial position to ensure that the bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions.

●   protect the bancorps reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes.

●   conduct business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures.

fifth thirds success is dependent on effective risk management and understanding and controlling the risks taken in order to deliver sustainable returns for employees and shareholders. the bancorps goal is to ensure that aggregate risks do not exceed its risk capacity, and that risks taken are supportive of the bancorps portfolio diversification and profitability objectives.
fifth thirds risk management framework states its risk appetite and the linkage to strategic and capital planning, defines and sets the tolerance for each of the eight risk types, explains the process used to manage risk across the enterprise and sets forth its risk governance structure.
●                                                                             the board of directors (the board) and executive management define the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies, and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. the bancorps risk appetite is set annually in alignment with the strategic, capital and financial plans, and is reviewed by the board on an annual basis.

●                                                                          the risk management process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks and ensuring appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place, and risks and issues are appropriately escalated. five components are utilized for effective risk management; identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk.

●                                                                           the board and executive management have identified eight risk types for monitoring the overall risk of the bancorp; credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, legal risk, reputation risk and strategic risk, and have also qualitatively established a risk tolerance, which is defined as the maximum amount of risk the bancorp is willing to take for each of the eight risk types. these risk types are assessed on an ongoing basis and reported to the board each quarter, or more frequently, if necessary. in addition, each business and operational function (first line of defense) is accountable for proactively identifying and managing risk using its risk management process. risk tolerances and risk limits are also established, where appropriate, in order to ensure that business and operational functions across the enterprise are able to monitor and manage risks at a more granular level, while ensuring that aggregate risks across the enterprise do not exceed the overall risk appetite.

●   the bancorps risk governance structure includes management committees operating under delegation from, and providing information directly or indirectly to, the board.

78  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp board delegates certain responsibilities to board sub-committees, including the rcc as outlined in each respective committee charter, which may be found on www.53.com. the ermc, which reports to the rcc, comprises senior management from across the bancorp and reviews and approves risk management frameworks and

policies, oversees the management of all risk types to ensure that aggregated risks remain within the bancorps risk appetite and fosters a risk culture to ensure appropriate escalation and transparency of risks.

credit risk management the objective of the bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the bancorp. the bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. the bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. these practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. the bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. the bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. underwriting activities are centrally managed, and erm manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. the credit risk review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. the bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and take any necessary charge-offs. the bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the bancorps credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. in addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios using the ccar model and for certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, the stress testing is performed by credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.
the following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:

in addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. the risk grading system currently utilized for allowance for credit loss analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. the bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness. a through-the-cycle rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. the dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. the probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system. the bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool. the bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a u.s. gaap compliant alll model and will evaluate the use of modified dual risk ratings for purposes of determining the bancorps alll as part of the bancorps adoption of asu 2016-13 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which will be effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2020. scoring systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.
79  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview inflationary expectations have changed little and are expected to remain near 2% in the coming year. the labor market has continued to tighten and unemployment remains low. household spending has continued to show strong growth. the fomc stated that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but the committee will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. market professionals continue to have an increased focus on wages, interest rates, input costs, tariffs, trade negotiations and foreign exchange. during december 2018, the fomc enacted an additional 25 bp increase in the target rate for federal funds. the federal reserve median forecast for change in 2019 real gdp is 2.41%, a slight decrease from the 3.1% rate in 2018. the federal reserve, in their minutes, continues to be concerned that tariffs could hurt the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of any damage. also concerning is the recent slowdown in homebuilding. there is a chance of higher interest rates in 2019 that would generally be detrimental to the bancorps clients financial condition.
market data and vacancies remain positive. competition for term loans on stabilized or near-stabilized assets remains highly aggressive in terms of pricing, recourse and repayment structures, as banks seek to diversify away from construction. construction costs continue to escalate and will likely be exacerbated by the impact of tariffs. the bancorp is also monitoring potential increased risks in the retail sector as a result of changes in distribution models with increasing levels of online purchasing and recent weakness in certain specialty retailers. however, needs-based retail and online retailers moving to brick and mortar are supporting continued development and lease-up for mixed-use retail centers. the bancorp has been focused on tenants that have multi-channel distribution and/or provide entertainment such as restaurants, cosmetic stores, fitness, grocery and drug.
during the third quarter of 2018, the southeastern united states experienced a major hurricane impacting the eastern portions of the states of north carolina and south carolina. the bancorp has limited credit exposure in the coastal regions of both states; however, temporary assistance was provided to customers that were negatively impacted. there is no expectation of any material net charge-offs as a result of the hurricane.
commercial portfolio the bancorps credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. the bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. the risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.
the bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. the origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. the bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.
the origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum ltvs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. the bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. although the bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.
the bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the ltv ratio. the following tables provide detail on the most recent ltv ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. the bancorp does not typically aggregate the ltv ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

consumer portfolio consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. these processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees.
the bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, automobile loans, credit card and other consumer loans. the bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. the bancorp does not update ltv ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. among consumer portfolios, legacy underwritten residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress during the past credit crisis. as of december 31, 2018, consumer real estate loans, consisting of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 12% of the consumer real estate portfolio. these loans accounted for 47% of total consumer real estate secured losses for the year ended december 31, 2018. current loss rates in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are below pre-crisis levels. in addition to the consumer real estate portfolio, credit risk management continues to closely monitor the automobile portfolio performance. the automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower ficos, longer terms and higher ltvs. the bancorp has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. the bancorp actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower fico scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations.
residential mortgage portfolio the bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher ltv ratios and lower fico scores. additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. the bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.
the bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. the bancorp originates both fixed-rate and arm loans. within the arm portfolio approximately $665 million of arm loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. of these resets, 95% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately one percent. underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination dti of 33% and weighted average origination ltv of 74%.
certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. these types of mortgage products offered by the bancorp include loans with high ltv ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in an ltv greater than 80% and interest-only loans.
82  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% ltv ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.
portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 92% of the portfolio as of december 31, 2018
and had a weighted-average ltv of 73% and a weighted-average origination fico of 760.

home equity portfolio the bancorps home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the bancorps newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. the home equity line of credit previously offered by the bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 26% of the balances mature before 2025.
the alll provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. the allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a tdr is determined on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. the loss factor for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends and refreshed fico score trends.
83  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
the home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined ltv greater than 80% and those loans with an ltv of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. for additional information on these loans, refer to table 43 and table 44. of the total $6.4 billion of outstanding home equity loans:
●   89% reside within the bancorps midwest footprint of ohio, michigan, kentucky, indiana and illinois as of december 31, 2018;

●   37% are in senior lien positions and 63% are in junior lien positions at december 31, 2018;

●     81% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year ended december 31, 2018; and

●   the portfolio had an average refreshed fico score of 745 at december 31, 2018.

the bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on fico score deterioration and property devaluation. the bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination. however, the bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. for junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the bancorp does not service. if the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. refer to the analysis of nonperforming assets subsection of the risk management section of md&a for more information.

the automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. as of december 31, 2018, 43% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by new automobiles. it is a common industry practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. the bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

analysis of nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including oreo and other repossessed property. a summary of nonperforming assets is included in table 51. for further information on the bancorps policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the nonaccrual loans and leases section of note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
nonperforming assets were $411 million at december 31, 2018 compared to $495 million at december 31, 2017. at december 31, 2018, $16 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $6 million at december 31, 2017.
nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and oreo were 0.41% as of december 31, 2018 compared to 0.53% as of december 31, 2017. nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 34% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of december
31, 2018 compared to 33% as of december
31, 2017.
commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $228 million at december 31, 2018, a decrease of $78 million from december 31, 2017. consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $120 million at december 31, 2018, a decrease of $11 million from december 31, 2017. refer to table 52 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases.
oreo and other repossessed property was $47 million at december 31, 2018, compared to $52 million at december 31, 2017. the bancorp recognized $7 million and $10 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of oreo properties during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately $30 million and $36 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

troubled debt restructurings if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. these modifications are classified as tdrs.
at the time of modification, the bancorp maintains certain consumer loan tdrs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. commercial loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. tdrs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained.
consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $961 million and $927 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or more were 25%, 11% and 39%, respectively.

analysis of net loan charge-offs net charge-offs were 35 bps and 32 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. table 55 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.
the ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases was 23 bps during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 22 bps during the year ended december 31, 2017.
consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans was 56 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 49 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on credit card of $17 million and increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans of $12 million as a result of growth in unsecured loans.

charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases
(a) for the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp recorded $29 in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is comprised of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments. the alll provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorp evaluates the alll each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall alll, including an unallocated component. these factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. the bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. refer to the critical accounting policies section of md&a for more information.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the alll and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. in addition to the alll, the bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the bancorps methodology for determining the alll. the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
91  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the alll attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios that has not been restructured in a tdr is calculated on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. the prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. for real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends, refreshed fico score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
the bancorps determination of the alll for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. in the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $163 million at december 31, 2018. in addition, the bancorps determination of the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. in the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $35 million at december 31, 2018. as several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the alll, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll. they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. given current processes employed by the bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

(b)   refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the deconsolidation of a vie.

certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments. due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of alll tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results.
an unallocated component of the alll is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. the unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was 0.12% and 0.13%, respectively. the unallocated allowance was 10% of the total allowance at both december 31, 2018 and 2017.
as shown in table 57, the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.16% at december 31, 2018, compared to 1.30% at december 31, 2017. the alll was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

percent of portfolio loans and leases market risk management market risk is the day-to-day potential for the value of a financial instrument to increase or decrease due to movements in market factors. the bancorps market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. interest rate risk, a component of market risk, primarily impacts the bancorps nii and interest sensitive fee income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income. management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:
●   assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;

●   short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or

●   the expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.

in addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on nii, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the bancorps earnings. stability of the bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. management continually reviews the bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to manage this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios. a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the bancorps risk tolerance.
interest rate risk management oversight the bancorps alco, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc, monitors and manages interest rate risk within board-approved policy limits. in addition to the risk management activities of alco, the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.
net interest income sensitivity the bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an nii simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of nii to changes in interest rates. the model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the bancorps assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. the model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions, as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies.
93  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2018, the bancorps interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in nii over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming a 200 bps parallel ramped increase and a 150 bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates. additionally, the bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including ramps, shocks and twists to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve.
in order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment, the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $500 million of additional demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. similarly, the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $500 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months above senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. the incremental balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate changes.
another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. this deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average rising rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 70% at december 31, 2018, which is approximately 10 to 20 percentage points higher than the average beta that the bancorp experienced in the last frb tightening cycle from june 2004 to june 2006 and higher than the most recent beta experienced in the current tightening cycle to date. the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average falling rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 40% at december 31, 2018. in addition, the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred for each rate move thus far in the current tightening cycle.
the bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. the bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities.

month horizon. additionally, $3.2 billion in out of the money cash flow hedges, originally maturing in 2019, were terminated to enhance asset sensitivity over the next year and to increase the capacity for additional cash flow hedges, as warranted. the changes in the estimated nii sensitivity profile as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in the outstanding taxable securities balances, a net increase in outstanding receive-fixed swaps against floating-rate commercial loans, the addition of forward starting floors against one-month libor, reduced noninterest-bearing deposit balances and a decrease in outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt. these items were partially offset by an overall increase in core deposit balances and a reduction in fixed-rate commercial leases and residential mortgage.

economic value of equity sensitivity the bancorp also uses eve as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. whereas the nii sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted nii on an fte basis (non-gaap) over one and two year time horizons, eve is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis. as with the nii simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis. particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits.
the following table shows the bancorps estimated eve sensitivity profile as of december 31:

while an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). further, eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. the nii simulations and eve analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates.
the bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, libor, prime rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks.

use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. examples of derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and tba securities.
as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge irlcs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. additionally, the bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.
the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers.
generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the bancorp from market volatility. credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
portfolio loans and leases and interest rate risk although the bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. the interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established.

residential mortgage servicing rights and interest rate risk the fair value of the residential msr portfolio was $938 million and $858 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. the value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans.
96  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its msr portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.
mortgage rates increased during the year ended december 31, 2018 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to slow. the fair value of the msr portfolio increased $42 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas spread assumptions and decreased $125 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december 31, 2018.
mortgage rates decreased during the year ended december 31, 2017 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to increase, leading to fair value adjustments on servicing rights. the fair value of the msr portfolio decreased $1 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas spread assumptions and decreased $121 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december 31, 2017.
the bancorp recognized net losses of $36 million and net gains of $4 million, respectively, on its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. these amounts include net losses of $15 million and net gains of $2 million, respectively, on securities related to the bancorps non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. the bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its msr portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on msrs.
foreign currency risk the bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. the derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the balance of the bancorps foreign denominated loans at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $948 million and $939 million, respectively. the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management.
commodity risk the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. the bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.
liquidity risk management the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. a summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorps treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the treasury department, and a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance. the bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. the contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. the contingency plan also outlines the bancorps response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios.
liquidity risk management oversight the bancorps alco, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within board-approved policy limits. in addition to the risk management activities of alco, the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.
sources of funds the bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.
table 62 of the market risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. of the $32.8 billion of securities in the bancorps available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at december 31, 2018, $3.3 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.2 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. for further information on the bancorps securities portfolio, refer to the investment securities subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a.
97  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset-driven liquidity is provided by the bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. a majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to fhlmc or fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. the bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $5.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $7.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017. for further information, refer to note 10 and note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
core deposits have historically provided the bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. the bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 83% of its average total assets for both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. in addition to core deposit funding, the bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the fhlb system. certificates $100,000 and over and deposits in the bancorps foreign branch located in the cayman islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.
as of december 31, 2018, $7.3 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current bancorps board of directors authorizations and the bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the sec to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. during the year ended 2018, the bancorp issued and sold $900 million of senior notes.
the banks global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $17.0 billion was available for issuance as of december 31, 2018. during the year ended 2018, the bank issued and sold $1.6 billion of senior bank notes. additionally, at december 31, 2018, the bank had approximately $45.2 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the fhlb and frb.
for further information on subsequent events related to long-term debt, refer to note 31 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio the bancorp is subject to the modified lcr requirement, which stipulates that bhcs with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the bancorp, maintain hqla equal to their calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. the bancorps modified lcr was 128% at december 31, 2018.
further, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018, bhcs subject to the modified lcr are required to calculate and disclose the quarterly average components used to calculate their modified lcr.
the following table presents the components of the bancorps quarterly average modified lcr for the three months ended:

on june 1, 2016, the u.s. banking agencies published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a modified nsfr for certain bank holding companies with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, including the bancorp. generally consistent with the bcbs framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of asf over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds the institutions amount of rsf, with the asf representing the numerator and the rsf representing the denominator of the nsfr. banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr would multiply the rsf amount by 70%, such that the rsf amount required for these institutions would be equivalent to 70% of the rsf amount that would be required pursuant to the full nsfr generally applicable to institutions with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures under the proposed rule. the comment period for this proposal ended on august 5, 2016.
on october 31, 2018, the board of governors of the frb released a series of regulatory proposals to implement the economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protection act (reform act). among the proposals, the board of governors, joined by the department of treasury, office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation proposed to remove the application of the lcr regulations and the nsfr from certain bhcs that qualify under the proposal as category iv
institutions, primarily those bhcs with consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, including fifth third bancorp.
the nprs public comment period ended january 22, 2019 and could be further amended by the frb and other financial regulators prior to adoption. as such, the ultimate impacts of the npr to fifth third bancorp, fifth third bank and their respective subsidiaries and activities will be subject to the final form of these nprs and additional rulemakings issued. fifth third cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
credit ratings the cost and availability of financing to the bancorp and bank are impacted by its credit ratings. a downgrade to the bancorps or banks credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the bancorps or banks financial condition and liquidity. key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.
the bancorps and banks credit ratings are summarized in table 65. the ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the bancorps and banks capacity to meet financial commitments.*

to control, monitor and govern operational risk, the bancorp maintains an overall risk management framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. erm is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). business controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day operational risk (first line of defense).
the bancorps risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. the corporate operational risk management function within enterprise risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the bancorps approach to managing operational risk. this includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, vendor risk management, cyber security risk management and review of operational losses. the function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. the lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. the framework is intended to enable the bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. these processes support the bancorps goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the bancorps performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.
the bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. fifth third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as board-approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls and dedicated security personnel. fifth third has adopted the national institute of standards and technology cyber security framework for the management and deployment of cyber security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the financial services information sharing and analysis center. to ensure resiliency of key bancorp functions, fifth third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to fifth third customers and its systems.
fifth third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the board of directors. the operational risk committee is the key committee that oversees and supports fifth third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. the operational risk committee reports to the ermc, which reports to the risk and compliance joint committee of the board of directors of fifth third bancorp and fifth third bank.
compliance risk management regulatory compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to fifth thirds activities and functions. fifth third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. the bancorps risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the bancorps risk appetite.
99  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to mitigate compliance risk, compliance risk management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. the lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas. additionally, the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing the compliance risk management program which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering, privacy and, in partnership with the community and economic development team, oversees the bancorps compliance with the community reinvestment act.
fifth third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the board of directors. the management compliance committee, which is chaired by the chief compliance officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports fifth third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. the management compliance committee oversees fifth third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of compliance risk. the management compliance committee reports to the ermc, which reports to the risk and compliance joint committee of the board of directors of fifth third bancorp and fifth third bank.
capital management management regularly reviews the bancorps capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. the bancorp has established a capital committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. these recommendations are reviewed by the ermc and the annual capital plan is approved by the board of directors.
the capital committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.
regulatory capital ratios the basel iii final rule was effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2015 and set minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defined the measure of well-capitalized.

on january 1, 2016, the bancorp became subject to a capital conservation buffer which will be phased in over a three-year period ending january 1, 2019. once fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital ratios, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. the capital conservation buffer was 0.625% in 2016, 1.25% in 2017, and is 1.875% in 2018. the bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized and capital conservation buffer ratios for all periods presented.
in april 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed transitional arrangements to permit banking organizations to phase in the day-one impact of the adoption of asu 2016-13, referred to as the current expected credit loss model, on regulatory capital over a period of three years. for additional information on asu 2016-13, refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the bancorp is evaluating the impact of this proposal.
the bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include aoci in regulatory capital in the march 31, 2015 ffiec 031 and fr y-9c filings.

stress tests and ccar in 2011 the frb adopted the capital plan rule, which requires bhcs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review. under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the bhcs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. further, each bhc must also report to the frb the results of stress tests conducted by the bhc under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. the frb launched the 2018 stress testing program and ccar on february 1, 2018, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the frb due on april 5, 2018, which the bancorp submitted as required.
as a ccar institution, the bancorp is required to disclose the results of its company-run stress test under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios and to provide information related to the types of risk included in its stress testing, a general description of the methodologies used, estimates of certain financial results and pro forma capital ratios, and an explanation of the most significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. on june 21, 2018 the bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its company-run stress test as required by the dfa stress testing rules, which is available on fifth thirds website at www.53.com. with fifth thirds designation as a large and non-complex bank, it is no longer subject to the qualitative aspects of the ccar program. it is, however, subject to the frbs horizontal capital review, which was conducted in the third quarter of 2018. refer to note 3 and note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the frbs review of the capital plan, the frbs non-objection to the bancorps proposed capital actions and the bancorps capital actions taken in 2018.
on may 21, 2018, the bancorp announced the planned acquisition of mb financial, inc. as a result of this transaction, the frb required the bancorp to resubmit its ccar plan recognizing the pro forma impact of the combined fifth third/mb financial, inc. post-merger entity. on october 5, 2018, fifth third resubmitted its capital plan to the frb. on december 27, 2018, the frb indicated to the bancorp that it did not object to the resubmitted capital plan. the resubmitted capital plan called for no change to the originally submitted total capital actions over the 2018 ccar approval horizon (the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019). however, the share repurchase authority increased from $1.651 billion to $1.81 billion as a result of after-tax gains related to the sale of worldpay, inc. common stock.
in april 2018, the frb proposed to introduce stress buffer requirements. under the proposal, a scb would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. the scb would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the frbs ccar stress tests plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. the proposal would also introduce a slb requirement, analogous to the scb, that would apply to the tier i leverage ratio. in addition, the proposal would require bhcs to reduce their planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bhcs own baseline scenario projections. the proposal is applicable for bhcs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including the bancorp. under the proposal, a bhcs first scb and slb requirements would become effective on october 1, 2019. the bancorp is evaluating the impact of this proposal.
dividend policy and stock repurchase program the bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. the bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.74 and $0.60 during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase and open market share repurchase transactions during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. refer to note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases and open market share repurchase transactions.

102  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, the bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the bancorps consolidated balance sheets. the bancorps off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments, guarantees, contingent liabilities and transactions with non-consolidated vies. a brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:
commitments the bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, noncancelable operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, capital expenditures, capital commitments for private equity investments and capital lease obligations. refer to note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on commitments.
guarantees and contingent liabilities the bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. refer to note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.
transactions with non-consolidated vies the bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve vies, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. the investments in those entities in which the bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on non-consolidated vies.
103  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and other commitments the bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2018 are shown in table 69. as of december 31, 2018, the bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the following table. for further detail on the impact of income taxes, refer to note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

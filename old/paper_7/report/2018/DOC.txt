results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) senior housing triple-net, (ii) senior housing operating portfolio (shop), (iii) life science and (iv) medical office. under the medical office and life science segments, we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs and life science facilities, which generally require a greater level of property management. our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triple-net leases and ridea structures. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of our debt investments, hospital properties, unconsolidated joint ventures and u.k. investments. we evaluate performance based upon: (i) property net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") and (ii) adjusted noi (cash noi) in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, and income from direct financing leases), less property level operating expenses (which exclude transition costs); noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unlevered basis. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." noi and adjusted noi exclude our share of income (loss) generated by unconsolidated joint ventures, which is recognized in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same property portfolio ("spp"), as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi. noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items. further, our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
39
same property portfolio spp noi and adjusted (cash) noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties. spp noi excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure, such as a transition from a triple-net lease to a ridea reporting structure, are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations or changes its reporting structure (such as triple-net to shop).
for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted, each of which is described in detail below. we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
nareit ffo. ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro-rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro-rata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro-rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro-rata financial information as a supplement.
nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
ffo as adjusted. in addition, we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets, losses (gains) from the sale of non-depreciable assets, severance and related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains) and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with
40
early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties, and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of deferred compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, (v) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (vi) non-cash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (vii) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (viii) deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, fad: (i) is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and (ii) includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc non-refundable entrance fees. certain prior period amounts in the "non-gaap financial measures reconciliation" below for fad have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. more specifically, recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("fad capital expenditures") excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in "other fad adjustments"). adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of fad for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our fad to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods (reported in "other fad adjustments"). see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad, and accordingly, our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits, management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. we believe fad is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, (iv) severance-related expenses and (v) actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable (in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude non-cash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases). furthermore, fad is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. fad is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to fad and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

(1)   for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" section below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares ("net income (loss)") increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a larger net gain on sales of real estate during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily related to the sale of our shoreline technology center life science campus in november 2018;
•   increased noi from: (i) annual rent escalations, (ii) 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, and (iii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2017 and 2018;
•   a gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in three life science joint ventures in november 2018;
•   impairments of our mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care (the "tandem mezzanine loan") in 2017;
•   a net charge to noi from the november 2017 transactions with brookdale (the "2017 brookdale transactions" - see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements);
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments, primarily in the second and third quarters of 2017 and throughout 2018, partially offset by an increased average balance under our revolving credit facility during 2018;
•   higher income tax expense in 2017 related to the impact of new tax rate legislation, partially offset by tax benefits from higher sales volume during 2017;
•   a reduction in litigation-related costs from securities class action litigation, and a one-time legal settlement in 2017;
•   a reduction in loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchases of our senior notes in july 2018 compared to july 2017; and
•   casualty-related charges incurred due to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.
the increase in net income (loss) was partially offset by:
•   a reduction in noi in our senior housing triple-net segment, primarily as a result of the sale of senior housing triple-net assets and the transition of senior housing triple-net assets to shop during 2017 and 2018;
•   a reduction in noi in our shop segment, primarily as a result of occupancy declines and higher labor costs;
•   a loss on consolidation of seven care homes in the u.k. during the first quarter of 2018;
•   a reduction in income related to the gain on sale of our £138.5 million par value four seasons health care's senior notes (the "four seasons notes") during 2017;
•   increased impairment charges on real estate asset recognized during 2018 compared to 2017;
42
•   a reduction in income as a result of: (i) asset sales during 2017 and 2018 and (ii) selling interests into the u.k. jv and msrei jv (see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements);
•   a reduction in interest income due to the: (i) payoff of our hc-one mezzanine loan (the "hc-one facility") in june 2017 and (ii) sale of our tandem mezzanine loan in march 2018;
•   increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2017 and 2018 and (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2017 and 2018, primarily in our life science and medical office segments, partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization from asset sales during 2017 and 2018;
•   a reduction in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures as a result of the sale of our equity method investment in ridea ii in june 2018, partially offset by additional equity income from the u.k. jv; and
•   an increase in severance and related charges during 2018 primarily related to the departure of our former executive chairman compared to severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former chief accounting officer ("cao") in 2017.
nareit ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss), except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•   gains on sales of real estate, including related tax impacts;
•   depreciation and amortization expense;
•   impairments of facilities within our senior housing triple-net and shop segments; and
•   net gain on consolidation.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting nareit ffo, except for the following, which are excluded from ffo as adjusted:
•   the net charge to noi from the 2017 brookdale transactions;
•   the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017;
•   severance and related charges;
•   losses on debt extinguishments;
•   litigation-related costs;
•   casualty-related charges;
•   the gain on sale of our four seasons notes during the first quarter of 2017; and
•   the impairments of our tandem mezzanine loan in 2017 and an undeveloped life science land parcel in 2018.
fad decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which is excluded from fad. the decrease in fad was partially offset by lower fad capital expenditures.

2017 and 2016
on october 31, 2016, we completed the spin-off of qcp. the spin-off included 338 properties, primarily comprised of the hcr manorcare, inc. ("hcrmc") dfl investments and an equity investment in hcrmc.

net income (loss) decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in net income from discontinued operations due to the spin-off of qcp on october 31, 2016;
•   a loss on debt extinguishment in july 2017, representing a premium for early payment on the repurchase of our senior notes;

the decrease in net income (loss) was partially offset by:
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017;
•   a reduction in severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former president and chief executive officer ("ceo") in 2016 compared to severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former cao in 2017;
•   a larger net gain on sales of real estate during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily related to the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets and the partial sale of ridea ii during 2017;
•   an increase in income tax benefit primarily from real estate dispositions during 2017, partially offset by an income tax expense related to the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017; and
•   an increase in other income primarily related to the gain on sale of our four seasons notes during 2017.
nareit ffo decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss), except for gain on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate, which are excluded from nareit ffo.
44
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in net income from discontinued operations due to the spin-off of qcp on october 31, 2016;
•   a reduction in rental and related revenues primarily as a result of assets sold during 2017, including the sale of 64 senior housing triple-net assets;
•   a reduction in earnings due to the partial sale and deconsolidation of ridea ii during the first quarter of 2017; and
•   a reduction in interest income due to: (i) the payoffs of our hc-one facility in june 2017 and a participating development loan during the third quarter of 2016 and (ii) decreased interest received from our tandem mezzanine loan during the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by additional interest income in 2017 from our u.k. bridge loan.
the decrease in ffo as adjusted was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017.
fad decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, (i) increased leasing costs and tenant capital improvements and (ii) decreased installment payments received from brookdale for 2014 lease terminations that were paid over a period of three years and concluded in 2017.

spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations. the increase in adjusted noi was partially offset by rent reductions under the 2017 brookdale transactions.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following non-spp impacts:
•   decreased noi from senior housing triple-net facilities sold during 2017 and 2018; and
•   decreased noi from the transfer of 25 and 22 senior housing triple-net facilities to our shop segment during 2017 and 2018, respectively.
the decrease in total portfolio noi and adjusted noi is partially offset by the aforementioned increases to spp. the decrease in total portfolio noi was further offset by the net charge of triple-net lease terminations from the 2017 brookdale transactions.

(1)   total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties and properties that transitioned segments through the disposition or transition date.
(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed a shop property that was placed into redevelopment, two shop properties that were classified as held for sale and 49 shop properties that were deconsolidated.
(3)   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the 12-month period and a quarter in arrears from the periods presented.
spp noi decreased primarily as a result of increased operating expenses related to the management fee terminations from the 2017 brookdale transactions.
spp adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   increased rates for resident fees and services; partially offset by
•   higher expense growth and a decline in occupancy.
additionally, total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following non-spp impacts:
•   decreased non-spp income from our partial sale of ridea ii; partially offset by
•   non-spp income for 42 senior housing triple-net assets transferred to shop during 2016 and 2017.

(1)   total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties and properties that transitioned segments through the disposition or transition date.
(2)   from our 2017 presentation of spp, we removed 12 life science facilities that were sold and three life science facilities that were placed into redevelopment.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   new leasing activity; and
•   specific to adjusted noi, annual rent escalations; partially offset by
•   a mark-to-market rent decrease on a 147,000 square foot lease in south san francisco.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to spp and the following non-spp impacts:
•   increased noi from: (i) increased occupancy in portions of a development placed into operations in 2017 and 2018 and (ii) acquisitions in 2017; partially offset by
•   decreased noi from: (i) sales of life science facilities in 2017 and 2018 and (ii) the placement of life science facilities into redevelopment in 2017 and 2018.

(1)   total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties and properties that transitioned segments through the disposition or transition date.
(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed one life science facility that was sold and four life science facilities that were classified as held for sale.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   mark-to-market lease renewals;
•   new leasing activity; and
•   specific to adjusted noi, annual rent escalations.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following impacts to non-spp:
•   decreased income from sales of life science facilities in 2016 and 2017; partially offset by
•   increased income from (i) increased occupancy in portions of developments placed in operations in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) life science acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.
the decrease in total portfolio noi and adjusted noi was also partially offset by the aforementioned increases to spp.

(1)   total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties and properties that transitioned segments through the disposition or transition date.
(2)   from our 2016 presentation of spp, we removed four mobs that were sold and two mobs that were placed into redevelopment.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of mark-to-market lease renewals and new leasing activity. additionally, spp adjusted noi increased as a result of annual rent escalations.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to spp and the following impacts to non-spp:
•   increased income from our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions; and
•   increased occupancy in former redevelopment and development properties placed into operations; partially offset by
•   decreased income from sales of seven mobs during 2016 and 2017 and the placement of one mob into redevelopment.

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt repayments, which occurred primarily in the second half of 2016 and throughout 2017.
depreciation and amortization. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2017 and 2018 (primarily in our life science and medical office segments) and (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2017 and 2018 (primarily in our life science and medical office segments), partially offset by dispositions of real estate throughout 2017 and 2018.

the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of income from our share of gains on sales of real estate in 2016, partially offset by income from our investment in ridea ii, which was deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2017.
54
total discontinued operations. discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted in income of $266 million. income from discontinued operations primarily relates to the operations of qcp. there were no discontinued operations for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2018.
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements, including principal payments and maturities; and (iii) satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members.
our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•   fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; and
•   fund future acquisition, transactional and development activities.
we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following:
•   sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties;
•   draws on our credit facilities;
•   issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt; and/or
•   issuance of common or preferred stock.
access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. for example, our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of february 11, 2019, we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch, baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p global on our senior unsecured debt securities.

approximately 98%, 84% and 83% of our total debt, inclusive of $43 million, $44 million and $46 million of variable rate debt swapped to fixed through interest rate swaps, was fixed rate debt as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. at december 31, 2018, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.04% and 2.15%, respectively. at december 31, 2017, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.19% and 2.56%, respectively. at december 31, 2016, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 4.26% and 2.23%, respectively. for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 3 below.
equity at december 31, 2018, we had 477 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled $6.5 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $13.5 billion.
at december 31, 2018, non-managing members held an aggregate of four million units in five limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications).
we renewed our at-the-market equity program in may 2018, pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we issued 5.4 million shares of common stock at a weighted average net price of $28.27 for net proceeds of $154 million (gross proceeds of $156 million, net of $2 million of fees paid to sales agents). at december 31, 2018, $594 million of our common stock remained available for sale under the at-the-market program. actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell any shares under our at-the-market program.
in december 2018, we entered into a forward equity sales agreement to sell up to an aggregate of 15.25 million shares of our common stock (including shares issued through the exercise of underwriters' options) at an initial net price of $28.60 per share, after underwriting discounts and commissions. the agreement has a one year term and expires on december 13, 2019. the forward sale price that we expect to receive upon settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustments for: (i) the forward purchasers' stock borrowing costs and (ii) certain fixed price reductions during the term of the agreement. at december 31, 2018, no shares have been issued under the forward equity sales agreement.
in december 2018, contemporaneous with the forward equity offering discussed above, we completed a public offering of two million shares of common stock at a net price of $28.60 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $57 million.
shelf registration we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s-3, using an automatic shelf registration process. our current shelf registration statement expires in may 2021, at which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. the securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. in addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under "contractual obligations".
inflation our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the consumer price index or other measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. substantially all of our senior housing triple-net, life science, and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. we consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("vies") when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie. a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie.
we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether: (i) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) substantially all of an entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights, or (iii) the equity investors as a group lack any of the following: (a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity. criterion (iii) above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause. if neither of those criteria are met, the entity is a vie.
we also make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to:
•   which activities most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and our ability to direct those activities;
•   our form of ownership interest;
•   our representation on the entity's governing body;
•   the size and seniority of our investment;
•   our ability to manage our ownership interest relative to other interest holders; and
•   our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable.
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. when we perform a reassessment of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie. we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides. if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, it may adversely impact the quality and/or timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting.
61
revenue recognition lease classification at the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. for leases entered into prior to january 1, 2019, a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) is equal to 90% or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset. if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl.
concurrent with our adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases ("asu 2016-02") on january 1, 2019, we will begin classifying a lease entered into subsequent to adoption as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee by the end of the lease term, (ii) lessee has a purchase option during or at the end of the lease term that it is reasonably certain to exercise, (iii) the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments is equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (v) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to us at the end of the lease term.
if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
rental and related revenues we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. if the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. when we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment. if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and, to a certain extent, is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
income from direct financing leases we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls. for leases accounted for as dfls, the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties, less the unamortized unearned income. unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment. if these assessments were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
interest income loans receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. we recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the interest method (applied on a loan-by-loan basis) when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans. if management determines that certain loans should no longer be classified as held-for-investment, the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted.
62
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for operating lease straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. for straight-line rent receivable amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. these estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
loans receivable and dfls (collectively, "finance receivables"), are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing, watch list or workout. finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations, and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured. watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout. workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined, based on current information and events, that: (i) it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement, (ii) the tenant, operator, or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement, and (iii) we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment.
finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured (the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout). further, we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant's, operator's, borrower's and/or guarantor's repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values. we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting: (i) if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable, net of associated allowances or charge-offs (if any), or (ii) we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable. for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received, excluding principal paydowns, to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms. for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment. generally, we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured.
allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses, if they are determined to be impaired. finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's or borrower's overall financial condition, economic resources, payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the net realizable value of any collateral. these estimates consider all available evidence, including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible, the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land and in-place leases. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired in-place leases.
a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development.
63
we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, but at least annually. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probability-weighted to reflect multiple possible cash-flow scenarios, including selling the assets at various points in the future. additionally, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we make assumptions regarding external market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment. this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets, future operating results and resulting cash flows, and the period over which we will hold each real estate asset. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based upon the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture. if an equity-method investment shows indicators of impairment, we compare the fair value of the investment to the carrying value. if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is other-than-temporary involves significant judgment. our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, severity and duration of a fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. capitalization rates, discount rates, and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements. our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a reit, (iii) the potential for built-in gain recognition, and (iv) changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision.

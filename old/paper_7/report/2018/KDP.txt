dr pepper snapple group, inc. merger on january 29, 2018, dps entered into a merger agreement by and among dps, maple and merger sub, whereby merger sub would be merged with and into maple, with maple surviving the dps merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of dps. the dps merger was consummated on july 9, 2018, at which time dps changed its name to "keurig dr pepper inc.".
maple owns keurig, a leader in specialty coffee and innovative single-serve brewing systems. the combined businesses created kdp, a new beverage company of scale with a portfolio of iconic consumer brands and expanded distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in north america.
see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information related to the dps merger.
overview kdp is a leading beverage company in north america, with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) csds, ncbs, including ready-to-drink teas and coffee, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers, and specialty coffee, and is a leading producer of innovative single-serve brewing systems. with a wide range of hot and cold beverages that meet virtually any consumer need, kdp key brands include keurig, dr pepper, canada dry, snapple, bai, mott's, core, green mountain and the original donut shop. kdp has some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers. kdp offers more than 125 owned, licensed and partner brands, including the top ten best-selling coffee brands and dr pepper as a leading flavored csd in the u.s. according to iri, available nearly everywhere people shop and consume beverages.
kdp operates as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor. we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system. kdp markets and sells its products to retailers, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, pure-play e-commerce retailers, and office superstores; to restaurants, hotel chains, office product and coffee distributors, and partner brand owners; and directly to consumers through its websites. our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.

uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. some of these items, such as increased health consciousness and changes in consumer preferences and economic factors, have previously created category headwinds for a number of our products. refer to item 1a, "risk factors", of this annual report on form 10-k for information about risks and uncertainties facing us.
we expect adjusted diluted eps growth for the year ending december 31, 2019 in the range of 15% to 17%, or $1.20 to $1.22, in line with our long-term merger target. supporting this guidance are the following expectations:
•   net sales growth of approximately 2%, consistent with our long-term merger target of 2-3%, despite the impact of the changes in partner brands in the packaged beverage segment.
•   merger synergies of $200 million for the year ending december 31, 2019, consistent with our long-term merger target for $200 million per year over the 2019-2021 period.
•   other (income) expense, net is expected to be approximately $30 million of expense for the year ending december 31, 2019 and assumes no gains related to changes in our packaged beverages partner brands, such as the impacts during the year ended december 31, 2018 from bodyarmor and core nutrition, llc ("core"), which recorded gains of $24 million and $12 million, respectively.
•   the adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25.0% - 25.5%.
•   adjusted interest expense is expected to be in the range of $570 million - $590 million, reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the continued benefit of unwinding swaps.
•   shares outstanding of approximately 1,420 million.
seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months, while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months. overall beverage sales can be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations.
segments as of december 31, 2018, we report our business in four operating segments:
•   the beverage concentrates segment reflects sales of the company's branded concentrates and syrup to third-party bottlers, primarily in the u.s. and canada. most of the brands in this segment are csds.
•   the packaged beverages segment reflects sales in the u.s. and canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products, including sales of the company's own brands and third-party brands, through our dsd and wd systems.
•   the latin america beverages segment reflects sales in mexico, the caribbean, and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages.
•   the coffee systems segment reflects sales in the u.s. and canada of the manufacture and distribution of finished goods relating to the company's single-serve brewing system, k-cup pods and other coffee products.
26
volume in evaluating our performance, we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates, finished beverages, pods or brewers.
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume as concentrate case sales. the unit of measurement for concentrate case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings.
concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases.
packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments, we measure volume as case sales to customers. a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us.
appliance and k-cup pod sales volume in our coffee systems segments, we measure our sales volume as the number of appliances and the number of individual k-cup pods sold to our customers.
comparable results of operations as a result of the recent dps merger, in order for management to discuss our results on a comparable basis, we prepared unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger, which was consummated on july 9, 2018, based on the historical results of operations of dps and maple. see supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information section at the end of management's discussion and analysis for further information on the assumptions used in the preparation of the financial information.
furthermore, management believes that there are certain non-gaap financial measures that allow management to evaluate our results, trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis. in order to derive the adjusted financial information, we adjust certain financial statement captions and metrics prepared on a pro forma basis for certain items affecting comparability. see non-gaap financial measures for further information on the certain items affecting comparability used in the preparation of the financial information. these items are referred to within the adjusted pro forma results of operations section, which is located at the end of management's discussion and analysis discussion, as adjusted pro forma net sales, adjusted pro forma income from operations, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma diluted eps.

executive summary
2018 financial overview
•   the following table details our net income and diluted earnings per share for 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017:
for the year ended december 31,   dollar         percent

net income attributable to kdp decreased $261 million to $586 million, or $0.53 per diluted eps, compared to $847 million, or $1.07 per diluted eps, driven primarily by the unfavorable comparison of the income tax benefits related to the tcja in 2017 and the higher interest expense, transaction costs and restructuring and integration charges associated with the dps merger, partially offset by the incremental income from operations impact of the dps merger.
•   during the last six months of 2018, we paid down approximately $938 million of our term loan, commercial paper and revolver since the dps merger.

(1)   the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 was prepared in order to populate the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for calendar year ended december 31, 2017 which will then provide a comparable period to 2018. see reconciliation of calendar year statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 for the full reconciliation of the calendar year ended december 31, 2017.
net sales. net sales for 2018 were $7,442 million. the primary change in our net sales during 2018 as compared to the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 of $3,328 million was the result of the dps merger.
gross profit. gross profit for 2018 was $3,882 million, or 52.2% of net sales as compared to $2,025 million, or 47.9% of net sales for the calendar year ended december 31, 2017. this increase in gross profit is driven primarily by the higher margins associated with net sales as a result of the dps merger.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses for 2018 were $2,635 million, or 35.4% of net sales as compared to $1,163 million, or 27.5% of net sales for the calendar year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in sg&a expenses was driven by the dps merger and reflects the incremental expenses associated with the dps operations as well as the transaction costs and restructuring and integration charges associated with the dps merger.
income from operations. total operating costs during 2018 were $6,205 million, resulting in an operating income of $1,237 million, or 16.6% of net sales.
interest expense. interest expense during 2018 was $401 million, or 5.4% of net sales, due primarily to the increased borrowings and assumption of the existing senior unsecured notes as a result of the dps merger, partially offset by the realized gains associated with the termination of receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps during the fourth quarter of 2018.
interest expense - related party. interest expense - related party during 2018 was $51 million, or 0.7% of net sales. these related party loans were capitalized into additional paid in capital at the time of the dps merger and no longer incur any future interest expense.
29
loss on early extinguishment of debt. we recognized a $13 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2018 as we voluntarily paid off the term loan a upon the consummation of the dps merger, compared to a $59 million loss on extinguishment of debt generated from voluntary prepayments of long term debt during calendar year ended december 31, 2017.
other (income) expense, net. other (income) expense, net in 2018 was a benefit of $19 million, primarily due to the distribution from bodyarmor, which resulted in a gain of approximately $24 million, compared to expense of $95 million during the calendar year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to the termination of our cross currency swap on euro denominated debt during the period.
effective tax rate. the effective tax rate for 2018 and the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 was 25.5% and (64.2)%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $484 million driven by the impact of the tcja. see note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.

net sales. net sales were $4,114 million for 2018, compared to $4,226 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. our net sales declined as a result of lower net price realization, reflecting the continued moderation in strategic k-cup pod pricing and the absence of the 53rd week of operations in 2018 that were reflected for the year ended december 31, 2017, partially offset by volume/mix growth and favorable foreign currency translation.
income from operations.  income from operations was $1,163 million for 2018, compared to $1,039 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily reflecting strong productivity that more than offset inflation in input costs and logistics as well as the absence of the 53rd week of operations in 2018.

net sales. net sales for transition 2017 decreased by $43 million, or 3.5%, to $1,170 million as compared to $1,213 million reported in the same fiscal period in 2016. the primary drivers of the change in net sales included:
•   unfavorable rate, primarily driven by strategic price alignment and increased trade spend with our pod business partners, which decreased net sales by 5%;
•   unfavorable product mix, which lowered net sales by 3%; and
•   increase in sales volume, which increased net sales by 4%.
gross profit. gross profit for transition 2017 was $527 million, or 45.0% of net sales (gross margin), a decrease of 3.5% as compared to $546 million, or 45.0% of net sales (gross margin), in the same fiscal period in 2016. the following significant drivers impacted the gross margin for transition 2017 compared to the same fiscal period in 2016:
•   unfavorable pod net price realization which reduced gross margin by approximately 360 basis points;
•   unfavorable pod mix due to a higher mix of partner and private label brands, which reduced gross margin by approximately 60 basis points; and
•   approximately 340 basis points improvement driven primarily by ongoing pod and brewer productivity improvements.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses increased 5.7% to $298 million in transition 2017 from $282 million in the same fiscal period in 2016. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses increased to 25.5% in transition 2017 compared to 23.2% in the same fiscal period in 2016. the 5.7% increase was primarily attributable to a 38%, or $14 million, increase in planned advertising and promotional spending primarily associated with television media campaigns aimed at driving household penetration of the keurig single-serve system.
income from operations. income from operations in transition 2017 was $229 million, a decrease of $35 million as compared to $264 million in the same fiscal period in 2016.
interest expense. interest expense was $10 million in transition 2017 as compared to $25 million in the same fiscal period in 2016. the $15 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to mark-to-market gains from interest rate swaps that economically hedge our variable interest rate exposure.
loss on extinguishment of debt. we realized $5 million in losses related to the extinguishment of debt from voluntary prepayments of our long term debt in transition 2017 as compared to $31 million in losses related to the extinguishment of debt in the same fiscal period in 2016.
effective tax rate. our effective income tax rate was (240.1)% for transition 2017 as compared to a 36.1% effective tax rate for the same fiscal period in 2016. the effective tax rate for transition 2017 was primarily impacted by a 24.5% blended (as defined in the internal revenue code) u.s. federal statutory rate as well as the net tax benefits related to a u.s. deferred tax rate change of $493 million as a result of the enactment of the tcja, and section 199 deduction, which is partially offset by a repatriation tax as a result of the enactment of the tcja and state taxes. the effective tax rate for the three months ended december 24, 2016 was primarily impacted by a 35% u.s. federal statutory rate, and net tax benefits related to section 199 deductions and foreign tax rate differential, which was partially offset by state taxes.
net income. net income in transition 2017 was $619 million, an increase of $474 million, or 326.9%, as compared to $145 million in the same fiscal period in 2016.

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by all risk factors discussed in item 1a, "risk factors" that could have a material effect on production, delivery and consumption of our products in the u.s., mexico and the caribbean or canada, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
36
we believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
•   our intention to drive significant cash flow generation to enable rapid deleveraging within two to three years from the dps merger;
•   our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("commercial paper") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million;
•   our integration of dps;
•   our continued payment of dividends;
•   our continued capital expenditures;
•   seasonality of our operating cash flows, which includes our payable extension program and structured payables, which could impact short-term liquidity;
•   fluctuations in our tax obligations;
•   future equity investments; and
•   future mergers or acquisitions of brand ownership companies, regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage.
financing arrangements refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for management's discussion of financing arrangements.
liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.

capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 were $66 million and primarily related to information technology infrastructure and systems and machinery and equipment.
capital expenditures for successor 2016 and predecessor 2016 were $33 million and $79 million, respectively, primarily related to machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure.
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents increased $44 million from december 31, 2017 to $139 million as of december 31, 2018, primarily driven by by operating cash flows.
our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements, scheduled debt and interest payments, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividend payments and business combinations. cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the u.s. periodically as working capital funding requirements in those jurisdictions allow. foreign cash balances were $59 million and $58 million as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. we accrue tax costs for repatriation, as applicable, as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions.

contractual commitments and obligations we enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of december 31, 2018:

(1)   amounts represent payments for the senior unsecured notes issued by us and the term loan credit agreement. please refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(2)   amounts represent our contractual payment obligations for our lease arrangements classified as capital leases. these amounts exclude renewal options, which were not yet executed but were included in the lease term to determine capital lease obligation as the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that the renewal appeared reasonably assured at lease inception. refer to note 13 for additional information.
(3)   amounts represent minimum rental commitments under our non-cancelable operating leases. refer to note 13 for additional information
(4)   amounts represent payments under agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including capital obligations and long-term contractual obligations.
(5)   amounts represent our contractual payment obligations for our build-to-suit financing lease obligations. refer to note 13 for additional information.
amounts excluded from our table as of december 31, 2018, we had $62 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. refer to note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2018 was approximately $30 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of u.s. defined benefit pension plans. we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control.
in general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. as of december 31, 2018, our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately $94 million.

critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is not "more likely than not" less than its carrying value ("step 0").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. for 2018, such discount rates ranged from 8.5% to 9.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      for purposes of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in the dps merger, we performed a step 0 test, concluding no further analysis was required.
if a quantitative analysis is required, the following would be required:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                long term growth rates are based on the long-term inflation forecast, industry growth and the long-term economic growth potential. for 2018, the long term growth rates ranged from 0.9% to 2.4%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 for the goodwill within the coffee systems segment, holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1, 2018 would not change our conclusion.
- the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           royalty rates are based on observable market participant information. for 2018, such royalty rate used in the impairment analysis of trade names ranged from 6.0% to 7.0%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        for the trade names within the coffee systems segment, holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of october 1, 2018 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our trade names as follows (in millions):

accruals for customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense, which is a component of our sg&amp;a expenses.
income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained , but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.             our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. as these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions.
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
if results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.                                                                                                                                                                the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable.   if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section.

off-balance sheet arrangements we currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and u.s. gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. refer to note 7 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our multi-employer pension plans.
there are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding. refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.
effect of recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and recently adopted provisions of u.s. gaap.

supplemental unaudited pro forma combined financial information and non-gaap financial measures supplemental unaudited pro forma combined financial information the following unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger, which was consummated on july 9, 2018, based on the historical results of operations of kdp (maple) and dps and reflects the change in year-end for maple. see notes 1 and 3 of our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the dps merger.
the following unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 are based on the historical financial statements of kdp (maple) and dps after giving effect to the dps merger, related equity investments, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma combined statements of income. the kdp (maple) statement of income information for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. see reconciliation of calendar year statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 for further information.
the dps statement of income information for the year ended december 31, 2017 was derived from its audited consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form 10-k dated february 14, 2018. the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income are presented as if the dps merger had been consummated on december 31, 2016, and combine the historical results of kdp (maple) and dps.
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments:
•   application of the acquisition method of accounting;
•   the issuance of maple common stock to jab in connection with the equity investments;
•   the conversion of maple parent corporation into kdp shares in accordance with the merger agreement;
•   the pre-closing maple share conversion;
•   the exchange of one share of kdp common stock for each share of dps common stock;
•   the change in year-end for maple; and
•   the alignment of accounting policies.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. we utilized estimated fair values at the merger date for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. during the measurement period, we will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, which may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared and presented in a form consistent with sec regulation s-x article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results. in addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income do not reflect any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the dps merger.
the historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the dps merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of kdp. as a result, under sec regulation s-x article 11, certain expenses such as transaction costs and costs associated with the impact of the step-up of inventory related to the dps merger are eliminated from pro forma results in all periods presented. in contrast, under the u.s. gaap presentation in note 3, acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results. see note 3 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, including the related notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of dps, and with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

non-gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with u.s. gaap, we have presented in this report selected unaudited pro forma combined financial information. we also present (i) adjusted pro forma net sales, (ii) adjusted pro forma income from operations, (iii) adjusted pro forma net income and (iv) adjusted pro forma diluted eps, which are considered non-gaap financial measures. this pro forma financial information and non-gaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the non-gaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-gaap financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-gaap financial measures in the same way. the adjusted measures are not substitutes for their comparable u.s. gaap financial measures, such as net sales, income from operations, net income, diluted eps, or other measures prescribed by u.s. gaap, and there are limitations to using non-gaap financial measures.
we define our adjusted non-gaap financial measures as certain pro forma financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability, which are defined below.
items affecting comparability: defined as certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods, adjusted for the tax impact as applicable. tax impact is determined based upon an approximate rate for each item. for each period, management adjusts for (i) the unrealized mark-to-market impact of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in accordance with u.s. gaap and do not have an offsetting risk reflected within the financial results; (ii) the amortization associated with definite-lived intangible assets; (iii) the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the dps merger and keurig acquisition; (iv) stock compensation expense attributable to the matching awards made to employees who made an initial investment in the keurig green mountain, inc. executive ownership plan or the keurig dr pepper omnibus incentive plan of 2009; and (v) other certain items that are excluded for comparison purposes to prior year periods.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to the dps merger and the keurig acquisition; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) transaction costs not associated with the dps merger; (iv) the impact of the step-up of acquired inventory not associated with the dps merger; (v) provision for legal settlements; (vi) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt and (vii) tax reform associated with the tcja.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the other certain items excluded for comparison purposes include (i) restructuring and integration expenses related to the dps merger and the keurig acquisition; (ii) productivity expenses; (iii) transaction costs not associated with the dps merger; (iv) provision for legal settlements; (v) the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of debt and (vi) tax reform associated with the tcja.

retail market performance, as measured by iri, remained strong for the year. our csd and enhanced flavored and premium water portfolios registered market share growth in both units and dollars, driven by strong performance of dr pepper, canada dry, core and bai. likewise, the coffee portfolio also performed well for the year, driven by single-serve k-cup pod category unit growth, combined with an increase in market share of k-cup pods we manufactured.
adjusted pro forma income from operations. adjusted pro forma income from operations increased $164 million or 6.7% to $2,620 million, compared to $2,456 million in the prior year. this performance primarily reflected the benefit of the net sales growth and strong productivity, despite inflation in input costs and logistics that were not fully offset by third quarter of 2018 pricing actions in the packaged beverages segment. also impacting the performance was the unfavorable comparison between gains of $49 million related to bai during the year ended december 31, 2017 versus the $22 million gain on big red during the year ended december 31, 2018. adjusted pro forma income from operations as a percentage of adjusted pro forma net sales grew 100 basis points to 23.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 22.8% in the prior year.
adjusted pro forma net income. adjusted pro forma net income advanced 22.8% to $1,451 million, compared to $1,182 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted pro forma income from operations and a significantly lower effective tax rate due to the tcja. additionally, adjusted pro forma net income was impacted by the non-operating benefits in 2018 of a cash distribution from bodyarmor in connection with our unit-holder interest and a gain related to the core acquisition. adjusted pro forma diluted eps increased 22.4% to $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $0.85 per diluted share in the prior year.

shipment volume growth for the segment was led by contract manufacturing, canada dry, body armor and core, partially offset by fiji and 7up.
adjusted pro forma net sales. adjusted pro forma net sales increased by 4.1% to $5,069 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by strong underlying volume/mix of 5.4%, partially offset by the expected 1.2% unfavorable impact as a result of changes in our allied brands portfolio and lower net price realization of 0.1%, which includes the pricing actions taken in september 2018.
adjusted pro forma income from operations. adjusted pro forma income from operations decreased 9.8% to $688 million, compared to $763 million in the prior year period due primarily to inflation in input costs and logistics, a $49 million unfavorable comparison due primarily to the $28 million gain on the step-acquisition of bai brands and a $21 million benefit as a result of the renegotiation of a manufacturing contract acquired during the bai brands acquisition in the prior year and higher general and administrative expenses. these drivers were partially offset by the increase in adjusted pro forma net sales and productivity improvements latin america beverages the following table details our latin america beverages segment's adjusted pro forma net sales and adjusted pro forma income from operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017:

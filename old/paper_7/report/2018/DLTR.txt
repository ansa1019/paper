item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management's discussion and analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including:
•   what factors affect our business;
•   what our net sales, earnings or losses, gross margins and costs were in 2018, 2017 and 2016;
•   why those net sales, earnings or losses, gross margins and costs were different from the year before;
•   how all of this affects our overall financial condition;
•   what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2018 and 2017 and what we expect them to be in 2019; and
•   where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures.
as you read management's discussion and analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended february 2, 2019, february 3, 2018 and january 28, 2017. in management's discussion and analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. we also provide information regarding the performance of each of our operating segments. unless otherwise indicated, references to "we," "our" or "us" refer to dollar tree, inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. they are listed below:
•   integration of family dollar
◦   in the third quarter of 2018, we announced that we plan to consolidate our store support centers in matthews, north carolina and chesapeake, virginia to our newly-completed office tower in the summit pointe development in chesapeake, virginia.
◦   based on our strategic and operational reassessment of the family dollar segment, following challenges that the business has experienced that have impacted our ability to grow the business at the originally estimated rate when we acquired family dollar in 2015, management determined there were indicators that the goodwill of the business may be impaired. accordingly, a goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the family dollar business was lower than the carrying value resulting in a $2.73 billion non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge.
◦   on march 6, 2019, we announced plans for a store optimization program for family dollar. for fiscal 2019, this program includes rolling out a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores, internally known as h2, to at least 1,000 stores, closing as many as 390 under-performing stores, re-bannering 200 family dollar stores to the dollar tree brand, installing adult beverages in approximately 1,000 stores and expanding freezers and coolers in approximately 400 stores.
•   supply chain
◦   in the second quarter of 2016, we completed construction of a new 1.5 million square foot distribution center in cherokee county, south carolina.
◦   in the third quarter of 2016, we completed a 0.3 million square foot expansion of our distribution center in stockton, california.
◦   in the second quarter of 2018, we completed construction of a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in warrensburg, missouri.
◦   during fiscal 2018, we began construction of a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in morrow county, ohio which is expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2019.
◦   in fiscal 2019, we announced tentative plans to construct a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in rosenberg, texas which is expected to be operational in the summer of 2020.
•   long-term debt
◦   during the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed the $750.0 million 5.25% acquisition notes due 2020 and accelerated the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the notes of $6.1 million.
27
◦   during the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our long-term debt obligations as follows:
▪   we completed the registered offering of $750.0 million of senior floating rate notes due 2020, $1.0 billion of 3.70% senior notes due 2023, $1.0 billion of 4.00% senior notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion of 4.20% senior notes due 2028;
▪   we entered into a credit agreement for a $782.0 million term loan facility and a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility;
▪   we used the proceeds of the above offerings to repay the $2,182.7 million outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities and redeem the remaining $2,500.0 million outstanding under our acquisition debt, resulting in the acceleration of the expensing of $41.2 million of deferred financing costs and the incurrence of $114.3 million in prepayment penalties.
◦   during the fourth quarter of 2018, we prepaid the $782.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility and accelerated the expensing of $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.
•   taxes - on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") was signed into law which lowered the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and made numerous other law changes, effective as of january 1, 2018.
overview we are a leading operator of more than 15,200 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. second is the performance of stores once they are open. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; however, they are not included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017. stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand.
at february 2, 2019, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended february 2, 2019 and february 3, 2018 is as follows:

stores are included as re-banners when they close or open, respectively. comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is re-bannered near an existing dollar tree store.
the average size of stores opened in 2018 was approximately 8,440 selling square feet (or about 10,480 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 7,350 selling square feet (or about 9,110 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. for 2019, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and approximately 7,000 - 9,000 selling square feet (or about 9,000 - 11,000 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits.
fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016 which ended on february 2, 2019 and january 28, 2017, respectively, each included 52 weeks. fiscal 2017 ended on february 3, 2018 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. the 53rd week in 2017 added approximately $406.6 million in sales.
in fiscal 2018, comparable store net sales increased by 1.7% on a constant currency basis. this increase is based on a 52-week comparison for both years. constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year's comparable store net sales in canada using the prior year's currency exchange rates. we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance. including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations, comparable store net sales increased the same 1.7% due to an increase in average ticket. on a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 3.3% in the dollar tree segment and increased 0.1% in the family dollar segment in fiscal 2018. including the impact of currency, comparable store net sales in the dollar tree segment increased the same 3.3%, as a result of a 1.8% increase in average ticket and a 1.5% increase in customer count. in the family dollar segment, a 2.0% increase in average ticket was offset by a 1.9% decline in customer count. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
we believe comparable store net sales continue to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives. we continued the roll-out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores in 2018 and as of february 2, 2019, the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 5,665 stores compared to approximately 5,205 stores at february 3, 2018. over the past year, we rolled out a new layout to a number of our dollar tree stores, which we call our snack zone. this layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas. as of february 2, 2019, we have this layout in approximately 930 dollar tree stores and we plan to implement snack zone in 1,000 new and existing stores in fiscal 2019. we believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.
we are executing several initiatives in our family dollar stores to increase sales. during fiscal 2018, we completed more than 500 family dollar renovations, and have completed more than 875 renovations since launching this initiative in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. in march 2019, we announced plans for a store optimization program for family dollar. this program consists of the following:
•   a roll-out of a new model for both new and renovated family dollar stores internally known as h2. we tested the h2 model in 2018 on a limited basis with positive results. this h2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings, including dollar tree $1.00 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors, throughout the store. h2 has increased traffic and provided an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10% over control stores. h2 performs well in a variety of locations, and especially in locations where family dollar has been most challenged in the past. we started 2019 with approximately 200 h2 stores and plan to renovate at least 1,000 stores to this model in 2019 and expect an accelerated renovation schedule in future years.
•   we plan to close under-performing stores. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we closed 84 under-performing stores which brought our total closed stores for the year to 37 more than originally planned. in 2019 we will accelerate the pace of closings to as many as 390 stores. the normal cadence of family dollar closings on an annual basis is approximately 75 stores. we expect to incur approximately $28.0 million in store closure costs, which does not include the cost of rent and other lease obligation and fixture costs.
•   we plan to re-banner approximately 200 family dollar stores to the dollar tree brand in 2019. we re-bannered 52 stores to the dollar tree brand in 2018 and have re-bannered approximately 350 stores since the acquisition of family dollar in 2015.
•   additionally, we plan to install adult beverage product in approximately 1,000 stores and expand freezers and coolers in approximately 400 stores in 2019.
29
in fiscal 2019, in addition to the approximately $28.0 million in store closure costs, we estimate that we will incur approximately $30.0 million of incremental initiative costs based on project count and velocity.
on september 18, 2018, we announced that as part of our continuing integration of family dollar's organization and support functions, we plan to consolidate our store support centers in matthews, north carolina and chesapeake, virginia to our newly-completed office tower in the summit pointe development in chesapeake, virginia. approximately 30 percent of the matthews associates, including more than 50 percent of the officers and directors, invited to move to chesapeake have agreed to do so. we are currently hiring to replace the associates who are not moving. we expect the consolidation to be completed by the fall of 2019. we expect to incur total pre-tax expense of approximately $37.0 million in connection with these plans in fiscal 2019 and we incurred approximately $7.3 million in 2018.
additionally, the following items have already impacted or could impact our business or results of operations during 2019 or in the future:
•   we have experienced disruptions and higher than anticipated freight costs primarily due to the truck driver shortage in the united states. we expect that this will result in higher costs in future periods as merchandise is sold and could result in lower sales if product is not received in our stores on a timely basis.
•   the united states trade representative (ustr) has implemented section 301 tariffs against $250 billion in chinese goods. although the tariff rate on $200 billion of those goods was originally expected to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent on march 2, 2019, president trump announced on february 24, 2019 that he would be postponing the increase. the duration of the postponement is unknown, and the final tariffs are subject to the outcome of trade discussions between the united states and china. however, we do not expect that the tariffs will be material to our business or results of operations in 2019. when the tariffs were implemented, approximately nine percent of our products, measured by sales volume, would have been affected. to mitigate the potential adverse effect of the tariffs, we negotiated price concessions from vendors on certain products, canceled orders, changed product sizes and specifications, changed our product mix and changed vendors. as a result of our mitigation efforts, we believe that we have reduced most of the potential adverse effects of the tariffs on the dollar tree and family dollar segments in 2019. however, we can give no assurances as to the final scope, duration, or impact of any existing or future tariffs and such tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if we do not continue to mitigate their impact.
we must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results.

fiscal year ended february 2, 2019 compared to fiscal year ended february 3, 2018
net sales. net sales increased 2.6%, or $577.8 million, in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the 53rd week in 2017, which accounted for approximately $406.6 million of sales, net sales increased 4.5%, or $984.4 million, resulting from sales of $618.5 million in new dollar tree and family dollar stores and increased comparable store net sales. comparable store net sales increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis as a result of an increase in average ticket. this increase is based on a 52-week comparison for both periods. comparable store net sales increased the same 1.7% when including the impact of canadian currency fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 3.3% in the dollar tree segment and increased 0.1% in the family dollar segment. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit decreased by $74.4 million or 1.1%, to $6,947.5 million in 2018 compared to $7,021.9 million in 2017. gross profit margin decreased to 30.4% in 2018 from 31.6% in 2017. our gross profit margin decrease was due to the following:
•   markdown expense increased approximately 30 basis points resulting primarily from expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and higher promotional markdowns in the family dollar segment.
•   merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 25 basis points resulting from higher domestic freight costs, partially offset by improvements in initial mark-on.
•   shrink costs increased approximately 20 basis points due to unfavorable inventory results in the current year.
•   occupancy costs increased approximately 20 basis points resulting from the de-leveraging from one fewer week of sales in the current year.
•   distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points resulting primarily from higher distribution center payroll costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $7,887.0 million in 2018 from $5,022.8 million in 2017, an increase of $2,864.2 million or 57.0%. this increase is due primarily to a $2.73 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the family dollar reporting unit, as further discussed in "note 3 - goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k. excluding the goodwill impairment charge, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $137.2 million or 2.7% from the prior year. fiscal 2017 included an $18.5 million receivable impairment related to our divestiture of certain family dollar stores, as further discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" within "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k, and a $12.6 million increase to the dollar tree workers' compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis. excluding the goodwill impairment in 2018 and the receivable impairment and workers' compensation reserve increase in 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 22.6% from 22.4%, as a percentage of net sales, due to the loss of leverage from the 53rd week of sales in 2017 and an increase of approximately 20 basis points in payroll costs. store hourly payroll costs were higher as a result of the planned reinvestment of income tax savings, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs resulting from lower earnings compared to targets in 2018.
operating income (loss). an operating loss of $939.5 million was incurred in 2018 compared to operating income of $1,999.1 million in 2017. excluding the $2.73 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2018, operating income decreased to $1,787.5 million in 2018 compared with $1,999.1 million in 2017 and operating income margin decreased to 7.8% in 2018 from 9.0% in 2017 due to the reasons noted above.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $370.0 million in 2018 compared to $301.8 million in 2017. the increase is due to the prepayment premiums paid during the first quarter of 2018 of $107.8 million and $6.5 million related to our redemption of the 5.75% acquisition notes due 2023 and term loan b-2, respectively. also, in connection with our debt refinancing, we accelerated the expensing of approximately $41.2 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs to the first quarter of 2018. these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense for the remainder of the year subsequent to the refinancing. see "note 6 - long-term debt," within "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k, for additional detail on the refinancing of our long-term debt. a $782.0 million term loan facility was included with the refinancing and it was scheduled to mature on april 19, 2020. we repaid this entire amount in january 2019 and accelerated the expensing of approximately $1.5 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs.
income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2018 was expense of 21.5% compared to a benefit of 0.6% in 2017. the rate in 2018 is the result of the goodwill impairment charge not being tax deductible. the 2018 effective tax rate includes an additional benefit
31
of $16.2 million related to the completion of our analysis of the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"). the tax benefit in 2017 is the result of the tcja that was signed into law on december 22, 2017, which lowered the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of january 1, 2018. the 2017 effective tax rate included the effect of a $562.0 million benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21%. the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate and a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes.
fiscal year ended february 3, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended january 28, 2017
net sales. net sales increased 7.4%, or $1,526.3 million, in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from sales in new dollar tree and family dollar stores, increased comparable store net sales and the 53rd week in 2017, which accounted for $406.6 million of the increase. comparable store net sales increased 1.9% on a constant currency basis as a result of increases in average ticket and customer count. this increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods. comparable store net sales also increased 1.9% when adjusted for the impact of canadian currency fluctuations. on a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 3.4% in the dollar tree segment and increased 0.4% in the family dollar segment. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $627.2 million or 9.8%, to $7,021.9 million in 2017 compared to $6,394.7 million in 2016. gross profit margin increased to 31.6% in 2017 from 30.8% in 2016. our gross profit margin improvement was primarily the result of the following:
•   merchandise cost, including freight, decreased approximately 50 basis points primarily resulting from improved mark-on in 2017.
•   markdowns decreased approximately 20 basis points resulting from fewer promotional markdowns in 2017.
•   occupancy costs decreased approximately 10 basis points primarily resulting from the leverage from the sales in the 53rd week.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $5,022.8 million in 2017 from $4,689.9 million in 2016, an increase of $332.9 million or 7.1%. as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.6% in 2017 and 2016. fiscal 2017 includes an $18.5 million receivable impairment related to our divestiture of certain family dollar stores, as further discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" within "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k, and a $12.6 million increase to the dollar tree workers' compensation reserves to record these on an undiscounted basis. excluding the receivable impairment and the workers' compensation reserve increase, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22.4%, as a percentage of net sales, due to the leverage from the 53rd week and the net of the following:
•   depreciation costs decreased approximately 25 basis points as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated on the family dollar segment and leverage from the comparable store net sales increase for the dollar tree segment.
•   store operating costs decreased approximately 15 basis points due to the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•   payroll expenses increased approximately 10 basis points, excluding the $12.6 million increase to the workers' compensation reserve, resulting from higher incentive compensation costs and higher store hourly payroll costs.
•   operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 15 basis points, excluding the receivable impairment, primarily resulting from higher advertising costs.
operating income. operating income for 2017 increased to $1,999.1 million compared with $1,704.8 million in 2016 and operating income margin increased to 9.0% in 2017 from 8.2% in 2016 due to the reasons noted above.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $301.8 million in 2017 compared to $375.5 million in 2016. the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding in 2017 as a result of $990.1 million in prepayments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the $500.0 million prepayment in the second quarter of 2017. fiscal 2016 also includes the expensing of $26.6 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million in fees associated with the refinancing of the new senior secured credit facilities. on january 30, 2018, we provided an irrevocable notice to the 2020 notes holders to call the $750.0 million 2020 notes on march 1, 2018. in connection with the early redemption of the 2020 notes, we recorded a make-whole premium of $9.8 million which was payable on the call date of march 1, 2018.
32
income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2017 was a benefit of 0.6% compared to expense of 32.6% in 2016. the decrease is due to the tcja that was signed into law on december 22, 2017, which lowered the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and made numerous other law changes, effective as of january 1, 2018. our fiscal 2017 includes 34 days in calendar year 2018, therefore our overall 2017 statutory federal corporate tax rate is 33.7%. the effective tax rate also includes a $562.0 million benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower statutory federal rate of 21%. the 2017 tax rate was also lower as a result of a reduction to the north carolina statutory tax rate which resulted in a decrease in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and a $9.9 million decrease in tax expense. the 2017 rate also includes a reduction of approximately $5.6 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations and the reduction of interest accrued on method changes. the tax rate in fiscal 2016 includes benefits resulting from a one-time election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes and a 1.0% decrease in north carolina's state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset.
segment information we operate a chain of more than 15,200 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income. we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including the allocation of distribution center and store support center costs, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. if the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.

fiscal year ended february 2, 2019 compared to fiscal year ended february 3, 2018
net sales for the dollar tree segment increased 4.9%, or $547.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the 53rd week in 2017, which accounted for approximately $199.2 million of sales, net sales increased 6.8%, or $746.9 million, due to sales from new stores of $388.6 million and a comparable store net sales increase of 3.3% on a constant currency basis resulting from increases in average ticket and customer count of 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
gross profit margin for the dollar tree segment decreased to 35.3% in 2018 from 35.8% in 2017. the decrease is due to the following:
•   merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 15 basis points primarily due to higher domestic freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark-on and a greater percentage of sales of higher margin general merchandise.
•   shrink costs increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current year.
•   distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily resulting from higher distribution center payroll costs.
•   occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points resulting from the de-leveraging from one fewer week of sales in the current year. excluding the de-leveraging effect, occupancy costs decreased approximately 5 basis points resulting from the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase in 2018.
33
operating income margin for the dollar tree segment decreased to 12.8% in 2018 compared to 13.3% in 2017. the decrease in operating income margin in 2018 was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above. selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales were 22.5% for both 2018 and 2017. store hourly payroll costs increased approximately 25 basis points as a result of the planned tax reinvestment in 2018 and were offset by decreases in incentive compensation and retirement plan contributions as a result of lower earnings compared to target in 2018.
fiscal year ended february 3, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended january 28, 2017

operating income margin for dollar tree increased to 13.3% in 2017 compared to 12.9% in 2016. the increase in operating income margin in 2017 was the result of higher gross profit margin. selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales were 22.5% for both 2017 and 2016. the fluctuations in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were as follows:
•   payroll costs increased approximately 25 basis points resulting primarily from higher store hourly wages and higher incentive compensation expense.
•   depreciation costs and utility costs decreased 10 basis points each resulting from the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and sales in the 53rd week.

fiscal year ended february 2, 2019 compared to fiscal year ended february 3, 2018
net sales for the family dollar segment increased $30.1 million or 0.3% in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the 53rd week in 2017, which accounted for approximately $207.4 million of sales, net sales increased $237.5 million or 2.2%, due to sales from new stores of $230.0 million and a comparable store net sales increase of 0.1%, resulting from an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in customer count.
gross profit for the family dollar segment decreased $213.4 million or 7.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. the gross profit margin for family dollar decreased to 25.3% in 2018 compared to 27.3% in 2017. the decrease is due to the following:
•   markdown expense increased approximately 60 basis points resulting from expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and higher promotional markdowns and seasonal markdowns.
•   merchandise cost, including freight, increased approximately 50 basis points, primarily due to higher domestic freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark-on.
34
•   occupancy costs increased approximately 35 basis points resulting from the de-leveraging effect of the sales from the 53rd week in the prior year and the minimal increase in comparable store net sales.
•   shrink costs increased approximately 30 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current year.
•   distribution costs increased approximately 25 basis points resulting primarily from higher merchandising and distribution payroll-related costs.
the family dollar segment incurred an operating loss in 2018 due to the $2.73 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge. in 2017, operating income was reduced by the $18.5 million receivable impairment related to our divestiture. excluding the goodwill impairment in 2018 and the receivable impairment in 2017, operating income margin for the family dollar segment decreased to 2.6% in 2018 from 4.8% in 2017, due to the gross profit margin decrease noted above and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales. excluding the goodwill and receivable impairments, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 22.7% in 2018, compared to 22.5% in 2017. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was due to the net of the following:
•   payroll expenses increased approximately 40 basis points primarily due to higher store hourly payroll expenses as a result of the planned reinvestment of income tax savings, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs resulting from lower earnings compared to target in 2018.
•   depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 10 basis points as a result of certain assets that were revalued upon the 2015 acquisition becoming fully depreciated and/or amortized.
fiscal year ended february 3, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended january 28, 2017
net sales for family dollar increased $500.6 million or 4.7% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to sales from new stores, the 53rd week in 2017 which accounted for $207.4 million of the increase and a comparable store net sales increase of 0.4% resulting primarily from increases in average ticket, partially offset by a slight decrease in customer count.

liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand our existing stores. our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of september and october. historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores
35
and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $255.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities in 2017 and increased payable balances.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163.1 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in inventories and other current assets, partially offset by higher net income, net of depreciation and amortization, the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities and increased payables balances.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $188.8 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due to increased capital expenditures. the increase in capital expenditures primarily relates to a new dollar tree distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2018 and the expansion of the dollar tree store support center.
net cash used in investing activities increased $144.3 million in 2017 compared with 2016 due to net restricted investment proceeds in 2016 and increased capital expenditures in 2017.
financing activities in 2018, net cash used in financing activities increased $948.4 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the prepayment of the $782.0 million term loan facility in january 2019 and our debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in the payment of $155.3 million of debt-issuance and extinguishment costs.
in 2017, net cash used in financing activities decreased $409.0 million compared to 2016 primarily due to lower principal payments compared to the prior year.
at february 2, 2019, our long-term borrowings were $4.3 billion and we had $1.25 billion available under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $182.9 million. for additional detail on our long-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of funding requirements below, as well as "note 5 - commitments and contingencies" and "note 6 - long-term debt" within "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k.
share repurchases historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. at february 2, 2019, we have $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview, including off-balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2019 to total approximately $352.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are approximately $1.0 billion, including planned expenditures for our new, expanded and re-bannered stores, more than 1,000 planned h2 renovations of family dollar segment stores, the addition of
36
freezers and coolers to approximately 500 new and existing dollar tree segment stores, the expansion of freezers and coolers in 400 family dollar segment stores, the construction of two new distribution centers and the development of additional parcels on our summit pointe property, located in chesapeake, virginia, for mixed-use purposes. we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

lease financing operating lease obligations. our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases. the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february 2, 2019 for stores that were not yet open on february 2, 2019.
long-term borrowings in the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed our $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% acquisition notes due 2020 and accelerated the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the notes of $6.1 million.
additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, we completed the registered offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2020, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior notes due 2023, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2025 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% senior notes due 2028. we also entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $2.03 billion in senior credit facilities, consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and a $782.0 million term loan facility. we used the proceeds of these borrowings and cash on hand to repay all of the outstanding loans under our then-existing senior secured credit facilities, including our term loan a-1 and term loan b-2, and redeemed all of our outstanding 5.75% acquisition notes due 2023. in connection with the foregoing transactions, we accelerated the expensing of approximately $41.2 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs, expensed approximately $0.4 million in transaction-related costs and capitalized approximately $36.9 million of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, which are being amortized over the terms of the new borrowings. we also paid prepayment premiums of $6.5 million and $107.8 million related to our redemption of the term loan b-2 and 5.75% acquisition notes due 2023, respectively. in january 2019, we prepaid in full the $782.0 million term loan facility.
in addition, upon the acquisition of family dollar in 2015, we assumed the liability for $300.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due february 1, 2021.
the interest on our long-term borrowings represents the interest payments on the foregoing long-term borrowings that were outstanding at february 2, 2019 using the interest rates for each at february 2, 2019.
for complete terms of our long-term borrowings, please refer to "note 6 - long-term debt" within "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k.

commitments letters of credit and surety bonds. we are a party to three letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing $125.0 million, $120.0 million and $110.0 million, respectively, for letters of credit. letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $166.4 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february 2, 2019.
we also have approximately $182.9 million of letters of credit outstanding that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and $66.2 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores and self-insured insurance programs.
purchase obligations. we have commitments totaling approximately $176.1 million related to legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. following is a discussion of the policies that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" under the caption "merchandise inventories" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at february 2, 2019 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2018, including the fourth quarter. we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink. the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value each year on a consistent basis.
self-insurance liabilities the liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers' compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. at least annually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
38
management's estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. in the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and adjusted for a control premium. under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management's judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. critical assumptions that are used as part of the family dollar goodwill evaluation include:
•   the potential future revenue, ebitda and cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. the resulting revenue, ebitda and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. we believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2018 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•   selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 8.0% for our fiscal 2018 analysis.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit.
our impairment evaluation of goodwill resulted in a $2.73 billion non-cash impairment charge in fiscal 2018 related to the family dollar reporting unit. no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017 or 2016. our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. the fair value of the family dollar trade name was within 1% of its carrying value.
for additional information on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to "note 3 - goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 42 of this form 10-k. for additional information on uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any

potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors" beginning on page 12 of this form 10-k, and elsewhere within this "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods. any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.

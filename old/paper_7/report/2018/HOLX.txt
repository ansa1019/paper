item  7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the information described under the caption "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this report and our special note regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this report.
overview we are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems, surgical products and light-based aesthetic and medical treatment systems with an emphasis on women's health. we operate in five segments: diagnostics, breast health, medical aesthetics, gyn surgical and skeletal health. we sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives.
we offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and through january 31, 2017, we offered products that screened donated human blood and plasma. our primary diagnostics products include our aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (panther and tigris), our thinprep cytology system, and the rapid fetal fibronectin test the aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or stds, chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or hpv, and trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. in addition, in 2017 and 2018 we introduced the aptima quantitative viral load tests for hiv, hepatitis c and hepatitis b. the aptima portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory ailments that are run on the panther fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to panther. the thinprep system is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the rapid fetal fibronectin test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth.
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of solutions for breast cancer care for radiology, pathology and surgery. these solutions include breast imaging and analytics, such as our 2d and 3d mammography systems and reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems and devices, breast biopsy site markers and localization, specimen radiology, ultrasound and connectivity solutions. our most advanced breast imaging platforms, selenia dimensions and 3dimensions, utilizes a technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3d images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast, which we refer to as the genius 3d mammography exam, as well as conventional 2d full field digital mammography images. our clinical results for fda approval demonstrated that conventional 2d digital mammography with the addition of 3d tomosynthesis is superior to 2d digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics for women of all ages and breast densities.
our medical aesthetics segment offers a portfolio of aesthetic treatment systems, including sculpsure, picosure and monalisa touch that enable plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other medical practitioners to perform non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures to remove hair, treat vascular and benign pigmented lesions, remove multi-colored tattoos, revitalize the skin, reduce fat through laser lipolysis, reduce cellulite, clear nails infected by toe fungus, ablate sweat glands and improve gynecologic health. this segment also markets tempsure a radio frequency, or rf, energy sourced platform that offers both non-surgical and surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures.
our gyn surgical products include our novasure endometrial ablation system, or novasure, and our myosure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, or myosure, as well as our fluent fluid management system, or fluent. the novasure portfolio is comprised of the novasure classic and novasure advanced devices and involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. the myosure suit of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. the fluent system is a fluid management system that provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures.
our skeletal health segment's products includes the horizon dxa, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the fluoroscan insight fd mini c-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient's extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.

acquisitions and dispositions cynosure, inc.
on march 22, 2017, we completed the acquisition of cynosure pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of cynosure. the acquisition was funded through available cash, and the total purchase price was $1.66 billion.
the allocation of the purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of march 22, 2017. as part of the purchase price allocation, we determined the identifiable intangible assets were developed technology of $736.0 million, in-process research and development of $107.0 million, trade names of $74.0 million, a distribution agreement of $42.0 million and customer relationships of $35.0 million. the fair value of the intangible assets were estimated using the income approach, specifically the excess earning method and relief from royalty method, and the cash flow projections were discounted using rates ranging from 11% to 12%. the cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model and the weighted average cost of capital.
the developed technology assets comprise know-how, patents and technologies embedded in cynosure's products and relate to currently marketed products. in-process research and development projects relate to in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use. the primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying product or expected commercial release depending on the project. we recorded $107.0 million of in-process research and development assets related to three projects, which were expected to be completed during fiscal 2018 and 2019 with a preliminary cost to complete of approximately $18.0 million. all of the in-process research and development assets were valued using the multiple-period excess earnings method approach using discount rates ranging from 14% to 22%.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we obtained regulatory approval for two projects with an aggregate fair value of $61.0 million and these assets were reclassified to developed technology. the remaining project, which had an initial fair value of $46.0 million, was abandoned in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to unsuccessful clinical results. as a result, the company recorded a $46.0 million impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
the calculation of the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. the factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill were based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the cynosure acquisition. these benefits included the expectation that the company's entry into the aesthetics market would significantly broaden our offering in women's health. the combined company was expected to benefit from a broader global presence, synergistic utilization of hologic's direct sales force, primarily its gyn surgical sales force, with certain cynosure products and entry into an adjacent, cash-pay segment. during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified indicators of impairment and performed an interim goodwill impairment test. this analysis resulted in us recording a goodwill impairment charge of $685.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. for additional information, please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
medicor medical supply on april 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of mms medicor medical supplies gmbh, or medicor, for a purchase price of $19.0 million. medicor was a long-standing distributor of our breast and skeletal health products in germany, austria and switzerland. based on the valuation, we allocated $5.4 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $8.9 million to goodwill.
emsor, s.a.
on december 11, 2017, we completed the acquisition of emsor s.a., or emsor, for a purchase price of $16.3 million, which includes contingent consideration which we estimated at $4.9 million. the contingent consideration is payable upon emsor achieving predefined amounts of cumulative revenue over a two year period from the date of acquisition. emsor was a distributor of our breast and skeletal health products in spain and portugal. based on our preliminary valuation, we have allocated $4.6 million of the purchase price to the preliminary value of intangible assets and $5.7 million to goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities.
41
faxitron on july 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of faxitron bioptics, llc or faxitron, for a purchase price of $89.0 million, which include hold-backs of $11.7 million that are payable up to one year from the date of acquisition, and contingent consideration which we estimated at $2.9 million. the contingent consideration is payable upon meeting certain revenue growth metrics. faxitron, headquartered in tucson, arizona, develops, manufactures, and markets digital radiography systems. faxitron's results of operations are reported in the our breast health reportable segment from the date of acquisition. based on our preliminary valuation, we have allocated $53.4 million of the purchase price to the preliminary value of intangible assets and $41.6 million to goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities.
focal therapeutics (subsequent event)
on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of focal therapeutics, inc., or focal, for an initial purchase price of approximately $125.0 million. focal, headquartered in california, has commercialized its biozorb marker, which is an implantable three-dimensional marker that helps clinicians overcome challenges in breast conserving surgery, or lumpectomy.
blood screening business disposition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our blood screening business to grifols for a sales price of $1.85 billion in cash, subject to adjustment based on the closing amount of inventory. the transaction closed on january 31, 2017 and we received $1.865 billion. the sale resulted in a gain of $899.7 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. as a result of this disposition and proceeds received, we recorded a tax obligation of $649.5 million, which was paid in fiscal 2017. upon the closing of the transaction, our existing collaboration agreement with grifols terminated, and a new collaboration agreement was executed as part of this transaction for us to provide certain research and development services to grifols. in addition, we agreed to provide transition services to grifols over a two to three year period depending on the nature of the respective service, including the manufacture of inventory, and we are in effect serving as a contract manufacturer of assays for grifols for a two to three year period from the disposal date. we also agreed to sell panther instrumentation and certain supplies to grifols as part of a long term supply agreement. following the closing of this disposition, we no longer operate our blood screening business, except to the limited extent we have agreed to support grifols. under the long term supply agreement, transition services agreement to manufacture assays, and research and development services, we recognized revenues of $55.4 million for the year ended september 29, 2018. for the disposed blood screening business, in fiscal 2017, revenue was $96.5 million, gross profit was $64.8 million and operating income was $45.8 million. for the disposed blood screening business, in fiscal 2016, revenue was $235.4 million, gross profit was $163.3 million and operating income was $99.1 million. revenue, gross profit and operating income of the disposed business represents the financial impact of the business as it was operated prior to the date of disposition. the operating expenses include only those that were incurred directly by and were retained by the disposed business and are now incurred by grifols. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.

we generated a 4.2% increase in product revenues in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to our acquisition of cynosure on march 22, 2017 and an increase in breast health sales. cynosure's results (after the date of the acquisition) are reported in our new medical aesthetics segment. cynosure is the sole business in this segment. partially offsetting the increase, our diagnostics business product revenues declined as a result of the sale of our blood screening business effective january 31, 2017, and we had lower revenues in gyn surgical. excluding blood screening, diagnostics revenues increased $46.6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. in addition, fiscal 2018 was a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year in fiscal 2017.
diagnostics product revenues decreased 3.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in blood screening revenues of $88.2 million in the current year as a result of the divestiture of the business during the second quarter of fy17. in connection with the divestiture agreement, we have committed to providing grifols manufacturing support through the defined transition services period and long term access to panther instrumentation and certain supplies. as such, we will continue to generate a level of revenues, but much lower than historical trends. product revenue under the new long term supply agreement and transition services agreement to manufacture assays for grifols was $45.4 million and $37.1 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. excluding the divestiture of the blood screening business, diagnostic product revenues grew driven by increases in molecular diagnostics of $43.6 million in the current year, respectively, while cytology & perinatal revenues were slightly higher by $3.0 million year over year primarily due to higher international sales volume.
molecular diagnostics product revenue was $601.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $557.6 million in fiscal 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to sales of our aptima family of assays on a worldwide basis due to our increased installed base of panther instruments, which is driving higher volumes of assay testing. in addition, we had an increase in the number of our virology products, as we have recently received additional international regulatory approvals. these increases were partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices, lower instrument sales and the loss of one week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. cytology & perinatal product revenue increased due to higher international thinprep volumes, partially offset by lower domestic thinprep test volumes, which we primarily attribute to screening internal expansion, as well as slight decline in average selling prices on a worldwide basis.
breast health product revenues increased 7.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased unit volumes of our newest 3dimensions, which also have higher average selling prices, and 3d performance systems, both of which complement our older 3d systems, increased sales volume of our affirm prone table and brevera breast biopsy system, which was recently commercially released in the u.s., an increase in eviva and atec volumes internationally, and the positive foreign currency exchange impact of the weakening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies. in addition, the acquisition of medicor and emsor, former distributors of our products, resulted in higher mammography system revenues, primarily attributable to higher direct sales prices in their respective territories. these increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of our 2d dimensions systems on a worldwide basis and lower 3d upgrades primarily as a result of a shift to 3d systems.
our medical aesthetics business commenced in fiscal 2017 as a result of the acquisition of cynosure effective march 22, 2017. product revenue increased 56.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to year over year increases in body contouring, skin, women's health and other product revenues as fiscal 2018 was a full year period compared to slightly more than six months of activity in fiscal 2017. the fourth quarter and annual period were affected by our decision to voluntary recall the tempsure vitalia system in response to a letter we received from the fda expressing concerns regarding "vaginal rejuvenation" procedures using energy-based devices, which specifically mentioned our monalisa touch laser. we believe our monalisa touch laser has the appropriate fda approvals. however, in considering the fda's broader concerns we elected to
44
suspend marketing and distribution of our tempsure vitalia handpieces and single-use probes until we have assessed the implications of recent fda considerations for devices in this category. as a result, we requested our customers to return any vitalia handpieces and unused probes they purchased and we recorded a $6.8 million reserve to revenue for issuing refunds and rebates. at this time we do not know if or when this issue will be resolved and if or when our commercialization of the tempsure vitalia system will recommence.
gyn surgical product revenues decreased 1.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower novasure system sales of $25.0 million from lower u.s. volumes partially offset by an increase in myosure system sales on a worldwide basis of $14.6 million. we attribute the decrease in novasure sales primarily to increased competition and a stagnant market for endometrial ablation, partially offset by a slight increase in average selling prices from a mix shift to the higher priced novasure advanced device. in addition, fiscal 2018 was a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year in fiscal 2017. offsetting these decreases is the positive effect of foreign currency exchange rates from a weaker u.s. dollar.
skeletal health product revenues increased 3.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher sales volume of our horizon osteoporosis assessment product revenues in the u.s., which was partially offset by a decrease in our mini c-arm sales, which we attribute primarily to competitive pressures.
in fiscal 2018, 74.2% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 12.0% in europe, 9.0% in asia-pacific, and 4.8% in other international markets. in fiscal 2017, 76.7% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 10.3% in europe, 8.5% in asia-pacific, and 4.5% in other international markets. the slight decrease in the percentage of u.s. revenues was primarily due higher revenues in other international markets as a result of our cynosure, medicor, and emsor acquisitions, and increased international sales volume of 3dimensions systems, thinprep pap tests and aptima products in europe and and asia-pacific.

service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. the majority of these revenues are generated within our breast health segment, and to a lesser extent, our medical aesthetics business. the breast health business continues to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period. our medical aesthetics business represented 10.6% and 5.6% of service and other revenues in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. service and other revenues increased 10.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher service contract conversion and renewal rates, higher spare parts sales, and the cynosure acquisition contributing an additional $31.5 million of revenue due to a full year of operations in fiscal 2018 compared to slightly more than six months of activity in fiscal 2017. partially offsetting these increases was the prior year included $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 33.5% in the current year, compared to 34.7% in the prior year. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2018 was lower than fiscal 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of cynosure in the prior year and the related impact of stepping-up the acquired inventory to fair value in purchase accounting, resulting in additional costs of $39.3 million in fiscal 2017.

diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased aptima assay volumes and higher volumes of our newer virology products, partially offset by an increase in international sales which have lower average selling prices and the divestiture of the higher margin blood screening business that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. the products that we supply to grifols under the supply and collaboration agreements are at significantly lower gross margins than we earned in the disposed business.
breast health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to decrease in 3d upgrades and c-view software sales, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, lower average sales prices of 3d dimensions systems in the u.s. from a mix shift to our lower margin 3d performance system and increase in the sales volume of digital mammography systems internationally, which have lower average selling prices. the decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume of the new 3dimensions system, affirm prone table and the brevera breast biopsy system, higher average selling prices for eviva and atec devices.
medical aesthetics product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impact of the step-up in inventory recorded in fiscal 2017 from the application of purchase accounting. partially offsetting this impact, in the current year we recorded a revenue reserve for the tempsure vitalia recall of $6.8 million and additional inventory charges.
gyn surgical's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower novasure volumes and continued mix shift to myosure products comprising a higher percentage of gyn surgical product sales. myosure devices have a lower gross margin than novasure devices. in addition, we had higher international sales which have lower average selling prices.
skeletal health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing variances and to a lesser extent pricing pressures on our horizon system.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. amortization expense increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase of $36.2 million related to intangible assets acquired in the cynosure acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to the divestiture of the blood screening business of $5.4 million, lower amortization expense related to the cytyc acquisition intangibles, which are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits, and having one less week of expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.

service and other revenues gross margin was 45.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 50.3% in fiscal 2017. the decrease in gross margin is primarily related to the lower margin cynosure service business being a higher percentage of the overall service business in fiscal 2018 from a full year of operations, the prior year included $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue that had no corresponding costs, and to a lesser extent an increase in costs to repair older digital mammography systems under service contracts in our breast health business. the decrease was partially offset by the breast health business continued strength to convert a high percentage of our installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period leveraging our service infrastructure.

** percentage not meaningful research and development expenses. research and development expenses decreased 6.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower project spend, including development materials and clinical spending, a reduction of outside consulting spend across the divisions and a reduction in headcount primarily in diagnostics, breast health and medical aesthetics. expenses were also lower in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the divestiture of the blood screening business and one less week of expenses partially offset by an increase of cynosure research and development expenses of $9.0 million due to a full year in fiscal 2018 compared to slightly more than six months of activity in the prior year. at any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased 9.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which increased $49.9 million in fiscal 2018 representing a full year of activity; however headcount was lower compared to the prior year as this business's expenses were aligned to reflect its operating results. excluding cynosure, selling and marketing expenses related to hologic's legacy business decreased $5.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower marketing initiatives and consulting expenses, lower spend on travel, a decline in sales personnel headcount in diagnostics and one less week of expenses, partially offset by higher salary compensation from increased headcount in breast health and to a lesser extent gyn surgical, and an increase in commissions and third-party commissions primarily in breast health.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 6.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which increased $22.1 million in fiscal 2018 representing a full year of activity; however headcount has been reduced as this business is integrated into our corporate structure. excluding the impact of cynosure, expenses related to hologic's legacy business increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased legal fees including settling the smith & nephew patent infringement lawsuit related to the myosure system for $34.8 million, fees incurred in the fuji and minerva lawsuits, increased international infrastructure costs, increased bad debt expense primarily from international and cynosure customers, higher tax consulting and accounting fees and increased information systems infrastructure and project costs. these increases were partially offset by lower costs in fiscal 2018 as fiscal 2017 expenses included a $23.2 million net charge for non-income tax related matters, which was net of the benefit from the medical device excise tax refunds, acquisition and divestiture transaction expenses of $23.2 million, higher integration and consolidation charges primarily related to the cynosure acquisition, and the prior year period included an additional week of expenses.

amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, distributor relationships and business licenses related to our acquisitions. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. amortization expense decreased 5.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower amortization from intangible assets related to the blood screening business of $10.4 million that was disposed of in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and one less week of expenses. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.9 million of amortization expense related to cynosure intangible assets, and increases from the medicor and emsor acquisitions.
impairment of intangible asset. in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we decided to cancel and abandon an in-process research and development project that was recorded as an intangible asset in the cynosure acquisition purchase accounting. the project was abandoned due to unsuccessful clinical results. as a result, we recorded a $46.0 million impairment charge to write-off the full value of the asset.
impairment of goodwill. during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with commencing our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process, evaluating the current operating performance of our medical aesthetics reporting unit, and abandoning an in-process research and development project, we reduced the short term and long term revenue and operating income forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our medical aesthetics reporting unit. the medical aesthetics reporting unit is solely comprised of the cynosure business, which we acquired on march 22, 2017. the updated forecast reflected significantly reduced volume and market penetration projections resulting in lower short-term and long-term profitability than expected at the time of the cynosure acquisition. as a result of these current events and circumstances, we determined that it was more likely than not that this change would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. assumptions used in the dcf require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the forecasted cash flows were based on our most recent budget and strategic plan and for the period beyond the strategic plan period, our estimates were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. we believe our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business. the discount rate used was intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and was based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) of market participants relative to the reporting unit. the basis of fair value for medical aesthetics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a non-taxable transaction, and the discount rate of 12.0% applied to the after-tax cash flows was consistent with that used in the purchase accounting performed in fiscal 2017. for additional information pertaining to impairment of goodwill, please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
gain on sale of business. in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sale of our blood screening business to grifols and recorded a gain of $899.7 million.
restructuring charges. in fiscal 2016, we implemented organizational changes to our international operations. in fiscal 2017, in connection with our acquisition of cynosure, we implemented certain organizational changes, and we also eliminated certain research and development positions in breast health and manufacturing positions primarily in our diagnostics division. in fiscal 2018, we finalized our decision to consolidate legacy international accounting and customer service organizations into our manchester, uk location and will be eliminating positions in belgium, france, italy, spain and germany. this transition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we also eliminated certain sales and marketing personnel in our diagnostics and medical aesthetics divisions. additionally, we decided to close our hicksville, new york facility which manufactures certain cynosure products and the employees were notified of termination and related benefits in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the related severance and benefit charges are recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or up-front for contractual benefits. in fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded aggregate charges of $14.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent lease obligation charges for facility closure costs. for additional information, please refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.

interest expense in fiscal 2018 and 2017 consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. interest expense in fiscal 2018 decreased compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to refinancing our 2022 senior notes with our 2025 and 2028 senior notes that carry lower rates, extinguishing our convertible notes in fiscal 2017 and 2018, receiving interest payments under our interest rate cap agreements, and fiscal 2017 included an additional week of expense. these decreases were partially offset by issuance costs expensed from the refinancing of our credit facilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, issuance costs expensed from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and an increase in the libor rate under our amended and restated credit agreement.

in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america, n.a. the proceeds under the amended and restated credit agreement of $1.8 billion were used, among other things, to pay off the term loan and revolver outstanding under the prior credit agreement. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, we completed private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes allocated between the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes. the proceeds under the 2025 senior notes and 2028 senior notes offering and our available cash were used to redeem the 2022 senior notes in the same principal amount. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $44.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
on various dates during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, we entered into privately negotiated repurchase transactions and extinguished $117.9 million and $168.0 million principal amount of our 2012 and 2013 notes, respectively, for an aggregate payment of $375.1 million, which includes a premium conversion resulting from our stock price on the date of the transactions being in excess of the conversion prices. in connection with these transactions, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $0.9 million and $2.3 million on the 2012 and 2013 notes, respectively, related to the difference between the fair value of their respective liability components and carrying values at the repurchase dates. the remaining cash payments were allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and recorded within additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders' equity.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 73.4% compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2017. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, applied to an overall pre-tax loss, resulting in a benefit, was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the favorable impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), which required us to remeasure our u.s. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the medical aesthetics goodwill impairment charge, substantially all of which is

non-deductible. the net result of implementing the act was a benefit of $346.2 million representing our best estimate based on our interpretation of the act. we are still accumulating data to finalize the underlying calculations, and the u.s. treasury is expected to issue further guidance on the application of certain provisions of the act.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible goodwill related to the sale of the blood screening business, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances for capital losses utilized against the capital gain generated on the sale of the blood screening business, earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, the domestic production activities deduction benefit, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to statutes of limitations expirations and audit settlements, stock compensation benefits, and federal and state tax credits.
segment results of operations we report our business as five segments: diagnostics, breast health, medical aesthetics, gyn surgical and skeletal health. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report. we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income. revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

diagnostics revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above. the primary driver of the reduction in revenues was the divestiture of the blood screening business in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to fiscal 2017 including a one-time gain on the disposition of the blood screening business of $899.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and a decrease in gross profit in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the blood screening divestiture. excluding the impact of the gain from this divestiture, operating income decreased $9.0 million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to the blood screening divestiture, partially offset by the improvements in sales of our aptima assays. gross margin was 47.1% in the current year compared with 47.8% in the prior year. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the disposition of the higher-margin blood screening business and lower margins generated under the new supply and collaboration arrangement with grifols. this gross margin decrease was partially offset by the impact of the increase in aptima assay volumes, and lower amortization expense.
exclusive of the impact of the gain on the sale of the blood screening business, operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower amortization expense primarily as a result of the blood screening divestiture, lower research and development expenses related to a reduction in project spending as well as the divestiture of the blood screening business, lower headcount in research and development and sales, no disposition transaction fees in the current fiscal year, and one less week of expenses in the current fiscal year, partially offset by restructuring charges for the current year. in addition, fiscal 2017 included a $5.5 million credit related to a refund received from amending our medical device excise tax filings.

breast health revenues increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase of $50.4 million in product revenue discussed above and $29.5 million in service revenue.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in the current year. the overall gross margin decreased slightly to 60.2% in the current year compared to 60.9% in the prior year primarily due to the increase in service revenue which has lower margins, decrease in c-view software and 3d upgrades, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, and an increase in international sales, which have lower average selling prices. the gross margin decreases were partially offset by higher gross margins from sales volume increases in the affirm prone table and the brevera breast biopsy system, and higher average selling prices of eviva and atec devices, and sales volume increase in the 3dimensions and 3d performance systems.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in salary compensation from increased headcount in the breast health sales organization as well as higher commissions and third-party commissions as a result of sales growth, an increase in legal expenses for the fuji litigation, increased expenses from the faxitron, medicor and emsor acquisitions, higher restructuring expenses and the fiscal 2017 included a credit of $4.5 million from amending the our medical device excise tax filings partially offset by a reduction in marketing initiatives. these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by one less week of expenses in fiscal 2018 and the fiscal 2017 included charges for non-income tax related matters of $5.8 million.

the operating loss in fiscal 2018 includes impairment charges for goodwill of $685.7 million and an in-process research and development intangible asset of $46.0 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, intangible asset amortization expense of $88.8 million and restructuring and integration charges of $9.5 million. these expenses combined with functional operating expenses are partially offset by gross profit, which increased due to a full year of operating activity and the prior year period included a $39.3 million charge from the step-up to fair value for inventory from the application of purchase accounting.
the operating loss in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to acquisition expenses of $18.8 million, amortization of intangible assets of $43.7 million, step-up to fair value of inventory sold of $39.3 million, restructuring and retention costs and integration expenses, including legal and professional consulting fees and accelerated depreciation expense, aggregating $25.7 million partially offset by gross profit from revenues.

gyn surgical revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increase in operating expense related to a legal settlement charge of $34.8 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. fiscal 2017 also included a charge recorded for non-income tax matters of $26.1 million. excluding the impact of the legal settlement and non-income tax matter, operating income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 would have increased $2.1 million due to a decrease in operating expenses primarily due to lower compensation from a decrease in sales personnel headcount, lower product development spend, and one less week of expenses in fiscal 2018. gross margin was relatively consistent at 63.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 63.6% in fiscal 2017. the decline is driven by lower novasure sales, which carry higher gross margins than myosure system sales, partially offset by lower amortization expense.

we generated a 6.7% increase in product revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to our acquisition of cynosure on march 22, 2017 and an increase in gyn surgical sales. we had decreases in our diagnostics business as a result of the sale of our blood screening business effective january 31, 2017. we also experienced decreases in our breast health and skeletal health segments. our diagnostics revenues, excluding blood screening, increased in the current year. the increase in overall product revenues was reduced partially by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar against a number of currencies, most notably the euro and uk pound. fiscal 2017 included an extra week as it was a 53-week fiscal year.
diagnostics product revenues decreased 3.3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in blood screening revenues of $94.6 million in the current year as a result of the divestiture of the business during the second quarter of fy17. in connection with the divestiture agreement, we committed to providing grifols manufacturing support through the defined transition services period and long term access to panther instrumentation and certain supplies. as such, we will continue to generate a level of revenues, but much lower than historical trends. in fiscal 2017, product revenue under the new long term supply agreement and transition services agreement to manufacture assays for grifols was $37.1 million. excluding the divestiture of the blood screening business, diagnostic product revenues grew driven by increases in molecular diagnostics of $57.5 million in the current year, respectively, while cytology and perinatal revenues were slightly lower by $2.4 million year over year primarily due to lower perinatal sales volume.
the increase in molecular diagnostics product revenues was primarily due to our increased installed base of panther instruments, which drove higher volumes of assay testing, in particular our aptima family of assays, an increase in the number of our virology products, as we had received regulatory approval for certain of these products, and an additional week in the current year compared to prior year. these increases were partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices, a reduction in cervista hpv revenues as our larger customers transitioned to our panther system, a reduction in cystic fibrosis revenues as we discontinued the product at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
breast health product revenues decreased 1.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower sales volume of our 3d dimensions systems and related components in the u.s., partially offset by an increase in international sales volume and 3d upgrades. the increase in international sales was partially due to our acquisition of medicor in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. in addition, the lower revenue reflected a decline in 2d systems primarily due to discontinuing the selenia system in fiscal 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the sales volume increase in our recently launched affirm prone table, an increase in c-view sales and higher volumes of our eviva and atec products, partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices for atec.
our medical aesthetics business was formed in fiscal 2017 by the acquisition of cynosure effective march 22, 2017. accordingly, we did not have any medical aesthetics revenues in fiscal 2016.
gyn surgical product revenues increased 8.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in myosure system sales of $33.0 million as myosure continues to gain strong market acceptance with new devices being released, such as the myosure reach, partially offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices primarily due to product mix. novasure revenues were lower by $2.9 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to slight decrease in average selling prices. our gyn surgical revenues were also adversely affected by the negative foreign currency exchange impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies.

skeletal health product revenues decreased 3.5% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a decrease in our mini c-arm sales in the u.s. due to competitive pressures, which was partially offset by increases in horizon osteoporosis assessment product revenues primarily attributable to higher sales volume on a worldwide basis.
in fiscal 2017, 76.7% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 10.3% in europe, 8.5% in asia-pacific, and 4.5% in other international markets. in fiscal 2016, 77.8% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 10.6% in europe, 8.3% in asia-pacific, and 3.3% in other international markets. the slight decrease in the percentage of u.s. revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes of 3d dimensions systems and related components in the u.s. and higher revenues in other international markets as a result of our cynosure acquisition.

cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 34.7% in fiscal 2017, compared to 31.8% in fiscal 2016. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2017 were higher in diagnostics and skeletal health, relatively consistent in gyn surgical, and decreased in breast health compared to fiscal 2016, resulting in the decrease in overall product margins. in addition, the cost of product revenues was higher due the inclusion of cynosure results partially due to the impact of the step-up in inventory from purchase accounting, which was $39.3 million in fiscal 2017, and the cynosure products having a lower gross margin than our legacy products.
diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the divestiture of the higher margin blood screening business that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. the products that we supply to grifols under the supply and collaboration agreements are at significantly lower gross margins than we earned in the disposed business. the cost as a percentage of revenue also increased due to a shift in sales to lower margin international molecular diagnostic products, a slight decline in aptima average selling prices, lower perinatal sales and the negative impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, partially offset by the increase in aptima assay volumes.
breast health's product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher software revenues for our c-view product and 3d upgrades, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales, as well as manufacturing efficiencies, increase in average sales prices for breast biopsy systems due to increased volume in our affirm prone table, and an increase in eviva and atec volumes. these decreases in product costs as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by the volume impact of the decreases in 3d dimensions systems and related component revenue.
gyn surgical's product costs as a percentage of revenue were relatively consistent in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

skeletal health's product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower volumes and an increase in obsolescence charges.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8 and 15 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. the decrease in amortization expense as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the divestiture of the blood screening business resulting in lower amortization expense of $17.9 million, and the $6.2 million acceleration of the discontinued cystic fibrosis developed technology asset in the prior year. the decrease was also driven, to a lesser extent, from lower amortization expense related to the cytyc acquisition intangibles, which are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits. these decreases were partially offset by amortization expense of $33.5 million from intangible assets acquired from cynosure.

research and development expenses. research and development expenses increased 0.3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure research and development expenses of $15.3 million and increased consulting expenses, partially offset by the divestiture of the blood screening business, lower project spend, and a reduction in headcount primarily in diagnostics. in addition, for fiscal 2017 there was an additional week of expenses. at any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased 20.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which contributed $81.0 million. excluding the impact of cynosure, expenses related to hologic's legacy business increased in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount in gyn surgical and breast health, increased training, meeting and consulting expenses and higher spend internationally as we invest to expand our presence in targeted geographic markets, partially offset by lower commissions, trade shows and marketing initiatives. in addition, there was an extra week of spend in fiscal 2017.

general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 28.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of cynosure, which contributed $30.4 million, which includes retention and integration related expenses including legal and consulting professional fees. excluding the impact of cynosure, expenses related to hologic's legacy business increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to acquisition and divestiture transaction fees of $23.2 million, charges of $35.6 million for non-income tax matters, increased compensation and benefits partially due to higher stock compensation, increased information systems infrastructure and project costs, integration and consolidation charges, and an additional week of expenses. these increases were partially offset by $12.4 million refund received in fiscal 2017 related to amended medical device excise tax filings, overall lower legal fees as the prior year period included a $6.0 million charge to settle a legal fee dispute, lower consulting and tax fees related to organizational structure changes and improvements and decrease in facilities costs.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, distributor relationships and business licenses related to our acquisitions. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. amortization expense decreased 30.3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets related to the blood screening business of $34.5 million that was disposed of during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. this decrease was partially offset by intangible asset amortization expense of $10.1 million as a result of the cynosure acquisition and an additional week of expense in fiscal 2017.
gain on sale of business. in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sale of our blood screening business to grifols and recorded a gain of $899.7 million.
restructuring charges.  in fiscal 2015, we decided to shut down our bedford, massachusetts facility and transfer production of our skeletal health products to a third-party contract manufacturer and other activities to our marlborough, massachusetts and danbury, connecticut facilities. we also implemented additional organizational changes to our international operations in fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, in connection with our acquisition of cynosure, we have and will implement certain organizational changes, and we also eliminated certain research and development positions in breast health and manufacturing positions primarily in our diagnostics division. pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the related severance and benefit charges are recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or up-front for contractual benefits, and other charges are being recognized as incurred. in fiscal 2017 and 2016, we recorded aggregate charges of $13.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, from these actions, primarily for severance and benefits and to a lesser extent facility closure costs. the current year charges are for severance benefits primarily related to the termination of cynosure executives and employees and lease obligation charges for a vacated section of our bedford facility. for additional information, please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.

interest expense in fiscal 2016 and 2017 consisted primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our convertible notes, 2022 senior notes, and amounts borrowed under our prior credit agreement, and accounts receivable securitization program. interest expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was relatively consistent but had offsetting factors. while we lowered outstanding debt balances as a result of scheduled principal payments, and convertible note repurchases in fiscal 2017, this effect on interest was offset by an additional week in the current year, higher expense from interest rate cap agreements and an increase in the libor rate compared to the prior year period.

in fiscal 2017, this account primarily consisted of a gain of $4.9 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan, $2.3 million in net foreign currency exchange gains partially due to hedging activities and $5.6 million of net realized gains on the sale of investments.
in fiscal 2016, this account was primarily comprised of a $25.1 million realized gain on the sale of a marketable security, and a gain of $3.3 million on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan. these gains were partially offset by an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $1.1 million on a marketable security and net foreign currency exchange losses of $1.0 million.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 38.6% compared to 20.3% in fiscal 2016. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible goodwill related to the sale of the blood screening business, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances for capital losses utilized against the capital gain generated on the sale of the blood screening business, earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, the domestic production activities deduction benefit, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to statutes of limitations expirations and audit settlements, stock compensation benefits, and federal and state tax credits.
for fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions subject to lower tax rates, the domestic production activities deduction benefit, and a change in the valuation allowance related to the sale of a marketable security with a higher tax than book basis.

diagnostics revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above. the primary driver of the reduction in revenues was the divestiture of the blood screening business in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the gain on the disposition of the blood screening business of $899.7 million partially offset by a decrease in gross profit primarily due to the blood screening divestiture. excluding the impact of the gain, operating income increased $28.7 million in the current year compared to the prior year. gross margin was 47.8% in fiscal 2017 compared with 49.5% in fiscal 2016. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the disposition of the higher-margin blood screening business and the lower margins generated under the new supply and collaboration arrangement, the slight decline in aptima average selling prices, a shift in sales to lower margin international molecular diagnostic products and the negative impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar on our sales denominated in foreign currencies, partially offset by the increase in aptima assay volumes and lower amortization expense primarily attributable to the divestiture of the blood screening business.
exclusive of the impact of the gain on the sale of the blood screening business, operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower amortization expense primarily as a result of the blood screening divestiture, lower research and development expenses related to a reduction in project spending as well as the divestiture of blood screening, and the refund received related to amended medical device excise tax filings, $5.5 million of which related to diagnostics. in addition, fiscal 2017 expenses were lower primarily due to a reduction of legal fees and charges as fiscal 2016 included a $6.0 million settlement of a legal fee dispute, and fiscal 2016 included $2.8 million for the medical device excise tax. these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in non-income taxes of $3.7 million recorded in fiscal 2017 and increased compensation from higher sales and marketing headcount.

breast health revenues increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due primarily due to an increase of $37.2 million in service revenue, partially offset by a $11.7 million decrease in product revenue discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in the current year. the overall gross margin increased to 60.9% in the current year compared to 59.9% in the prior year primarily due to the increase in service revenue and software product sales, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales. the gross margin increases were partially offset by the volume impact of the decreases in 3d dimensions systems and related component revenue in the us.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. we experienced an increase in non-income tax charges of $5.8 million recorded in fiscal 2017, an increase in compensation and commissions from increased head count, higher marketing expenditures internationally, increased legal fees, and operating expenses from medicor. these increases were partially offset by lower marketing initiatives and program spend on genius 3d, lower meeting and related expenses, lower

medical aesthetics revenues increased in fiscal 2017 related to the acquisition of cynosure on march 22, 2017.
the operating loss of $115.9 million in the fiscal 2017 was primarily due to acquisition transaction fees of $18.8 million, amortization of intangible assets of $43.7 million, the step-up to fair value of inventory sold of $39.3 million, and restructuring, retention and integration expenses, including legal and professional consulting fees and accelerated depreciation expense, aggregating $25.7 million partially offset by gross profit.

skeletal health revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above.
operating income decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from lower revenues and increased obsolescence charges. gross margin rate was 42.2% in fiscal 2017 compared to 46.3% in fiscal 2016. this business also had higher operating expenses in fiscal 2017 primarily related to the facility closure costs incurred for the bedford facility of $4.8 million.
liquidity and capital resources at september 29, 2018, we had a positive $320.6 million of working capital, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $666.7 million. our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $126.1 million during fiscal 2018 principally due to cash generated through operating activities, partially offset by acquisition payments for faxitron and emsor, capital expenditures, payments to extinguish our convertible notes and repurchase of our common stock.
in fiscal 2018, our operating activities provided us with $732.9 million of cash. we incurred a net loss of $111.3 million which was offset by a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges aggregating $731.7 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $480.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $65.0 million, debt extinguishment losses of $45.9 million, and non-cash interest expense of $15.0 million related to our outstanding debt. these adjustments to net loss were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $477.3 million primarily from the change in tax rate due to tax reform, and to a lesser extent, the amortization of intangible assets. cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $26.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by an increase in inventory of $50.6 million primarily to meet anticipated demand, launch newer products, and build up safety stock, and an increase in accounts receivable of $38.2 million primarily due to a higher portion of revenues occurring in the last month of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulting in an increase in days sales outstanding. partially offsetting these cash outflows was an increase in accrued expenses of $53.8 million related to increase in accrued legal expenses from the smith & nephew litigation settlement, higher accrued commissions and accrued interest due to the timing of payments, and an increase in accounts payable of $23.9 million primarily due to the timing of payments.
in fiscal 2018, our investing activities used cash of $195.2 million primarily related to $105.6 million for capital expenditures, which consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware, and $76.5 million in net cash used to acquire faxitron and emsor.
in fiscal 2018, our financing activities used cash of $404.8 million, primarily for payments of $1.35 billion to pay off the term loan outstanding under the prior credit agreement, $1.0 billion to pay off the 2022 senior notes, $546.2 million to repurchase and cash settle the conversion of our 2042 and 2043 convertible notes, $45.0 million of net repayments on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit line, $275.8 million for repurchases of our common stock, $23.5 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to our multiple refinancings during the year, and payments of $16.7 million for employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $1.5 billion from the amended and restated credit agreement, proceeds of $1.35 billion from issuance of the 2025 and 2028 senior notes, net borrowings of $25.0 million from the accounts receivable securitization and $33.2 million from our equity plans, primarily from the exercise of stock options.
debt we had total recorded debt outstanding of $3.3 billion at september 29, 2018, which was comprised of amounts outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement and amended revolver of $1.75 billion (principal $1.76 billion), our 2025 senior notes of $935.2 million (principal of $950.0 million), our 2028 senior notes of $393.1 million (principal of $400.0 million), and amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization program of $225.0 million.

amended and restated credit agreement on october 3, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement (the "amended and restated credit agreement") with bank of america, n.a. in its capacity as administrative agent, swing line lender and l/c issuer, and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto. the amended and restated credit agreement amended and restated the company's prior credit and guaranty agreement, originally dated as of may 29, 2015 (the "prior credit agreement"). borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of the company's u.s. subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. for example, borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are not secured by those accounts receivable that are transferred to the special purpose entity under the company's accounts receivable securitization program.
as of september 29, 2018, the credit facilities under the amended and restated credit agreement consisted of:
•   a $1.5 billion secured term loan to the company ("amended term loan") with a maturity date of october 3, 2022, of which $1.45 billion was outstanding at september 29, 2018; and
•   a secured revolving credit facility (the "amended revolver") under which we may borrow up to $1.5 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a maturity date of october 3, 2022, of which $300.0 million was outstanding at september 29, 2018. subsequent to september 29, 2018, the company borrowed an additional $50.0 million.
as of september 29, 2018, the interest rate under the amended term loan and amended revolver was 3.74% on the outstanding amounts, which was reflective of the eurocurrency rate (i.e., libor) plus the applicable margin of 1.50% per annum as set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement. the applicable margin was subject to specified changes depending on the total net leverage ratio as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement.
we are required to make scheduled principal payments under the amended term loan in increasing amounts ranging from $9.375 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on december 29, 2017 to $37.5 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on december 23, 2021. the remaining balance of the amended term loan was due at maturity. any amounts outstanding under the amended revolver are due at maturity. in addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement, in certain circumstances we are required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights) ("mandatory prepayments"). these mandatory prepayments are required to be applied by us, first, to the amended term loan, second, to any outstanding amount under any swing line loans (as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement), third, to the amended revolver, fourth to prepay any outstanding reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit (as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement) and fifth, to cash collateralize any letters of credit. subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily prepay any of the amended and restated credit facilities without premium or penalty.
the amended and restated credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of our businesses. in addition, the amended and restated credit agreement required us to maintain certain financial ratios. the amended and restated credit agreement also contained customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross defaults and an event of default upon a change of control of the company.
the amended and restated credit agreement contained two financial covenants (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter and an excess cash flow prepayment requirement measured as of the end of each fiscal year. as of september 29, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants, and no mandatory prepayments were required as of september 29, 2018.
2025 senior notes on october 10, 2017, we completed a private placement of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.375% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 senior notes") at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes. on january 19, 2018, the company completed a private placement and allocated an additional $600 million in aggregate principal amount to its 2025 senior notes pursuant to a supplement to the indenture governing the company's existing 2025 senior notes at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount. as a result, the total aggregate principal balance of 2025 senior notes is $950 million. the 2025 senior notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. the 2025 senior notes mature on
61
october 15, 2025 and bear interest at the rate of 4.375% per year, payable semi-annually on april 15 and october 15 of each year, commencing on april 15, 2018.
we may redeem the 2025 senior notes at any time prior to october 15, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before october 15, 2020, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. we also have the option to redeem the 2025 senior notes on or after: october 15, 2020 through october 14, 2021 at 102.188% of par; october 15, 2021 through october 14, 2022 at 101.094% of par; and october 15, 2022 and thereafter at 100% of par. in addition, if we undergo a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder's 2025 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
2028 senior notes on january 19, 2018, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and allocated $400 million aggregate principal amounts to our 4.625% senior notes due 2028 (the "2028 senior notes") at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 senior notes. the remaining proceeds were allocated to the purchase of the 2025 senior notes as described above. the 2028 senior notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. the 2028 senior notes mature on february 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on february 1 and august 1 of each year, commencing on august 1, 2018.
we may redeem the 2028 senior notes at any time prior to february 1, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before february 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. we also have the option to redeem the 2028 senior notes on or after: february 1, 2023 through february 1, 2024 at 102.312% of par; february 1, 2024 through february 1, 2025 at 101.541% of par; february 1, 2025 through february 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and february 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. in addition, if we undergo a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder's 2028 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
accounts receivable securitization program on april 25, 2016, we entered into a one-year $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization program (the "securitization program") with several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. under the terms of the securitization program, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries sell our customer receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is wholly-owned by us. in addition, we also contributed a portion of our customer receivables to the special purpose entity in connection with its establishment. we retain servicing responsibility. the special purpose entity, as borrower, and we, as servicer, have entered into a credit and security agreement with several lenders pursuant to which the special purpose entity may borrow from the lenders up to the maximum borrowing amount allowed, with the loans secured by the receivables. the amount that the special purpose entity may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying receivables that are present in the special purpose entity at such point in time. the assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities.
we extended the program for an additional year in april 2017 and again in april 2018. the maximum borrowing amount was increased from $200.0 million to $225.0 million. the entire amount available of $225.0 million is outstanding at september 29, 2018. borrowings outstanding under the securitization program bear interest at libor plus the applicable margin of 0.7% and are included as a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of net receivables in our consolidated balance sheet. as of september 29, 2018, the interest rate under the securitization program was 2.24% on the outstanding amounts. we and the special purpose entity are operated and maintained as separate legal entities. the assets of the special purpose entity secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. the special purpose entity was not a guarantor under our credit agreement and is not a guarantor under our amended and restated credit agreement or of our 2022 and 2025 senior notes.
62
the credit and security agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, and an event of default upon a change of control. in addition, it contains financial covenants consistent with that of the credit agreement. as of september 29, 2018, the company was in compliance with the credit and security agreement covenants.
subsequent events focal therapeutics on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of focal therapeutics for an initial purchase price of approximately $125.0 million and paid $108.0 million in initial consideration, which is less certain holdbacks. the final purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment.
stock repurchase program on june 21, 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock over the next five years. under this authorization, we repurchased 10.3 million shares for total consideration of $387.4 million.
on june 13, 2018, the board of directors authorized another share repurchase plan to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock. this share repurchase plan, which replaced the prior plan, was effective august 1, 2018 and expires on june 13, 2023. under this authorization, during the fourth quarter of 2018 we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for a total consideration of $88.5 million. as of september 29, 2018, $411.5 million was available under this authorization. subsequent to september 29, 2018, we repurchased1.5 million shares of its common stock for total consideration of $60.6 million.

(1)   included within long-term debt obligations are the amended term loan, amended revolver, borrowings under the securitization program, and the 2025 and 2028 senior notes.
(2)   as a result of the cynosure acquisition, we have capital leases for the buildings at its primary u.s. operating facility and certain equipment and vehicles.
(3)   the financing leases represent two leases for two separate manufacturing facilities, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under u.s. gaap. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
(4)   purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments and, to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.
(5)   pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $49.8 million at september 29, 2018, which is recorded as a current liability. deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.
the above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions recorded under fin 48 (codified primarily in asc 740, income taxes) totaling $89.5 million. due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits.
future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions and alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business. subject to the risk factors set forth in part i, item 1a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this annual report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, the cash available under our amended revolver and our securitization program will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, strategic transactions or other investments. as described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement, 2025 senior notes, 2028 senior notes and the securitization program. these capital requirements could be substantial. our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report. these risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. in connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. these estimates are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. in accordance with asc 450, contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. it is possible that future results for any particular
64
quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
inventory our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment and diagnostic test kits, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. these cash flow projections are discounted with an risk adjusted rate. quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill.
we generally use the income approach in which cash flow projections on an after-tax basis are discounted using a risk adjusted rate to determine the estimated fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development projects, customer relationships, and trade names.
with respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. generally, we apply the cost or income approach as the primary methods in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.
goodwill
65
we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.
in performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under asc 350. the first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit's carrying value to its fair value. we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or wacc, of market participants. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we apply the single step approach under asu 2017-04. as a result of this simplified approach the goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value to the extent of the goodwill balance. we adopted this asu in fiscal 2018.
we conducted our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. we utilized discounted cash flows, or dcf, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of july 1, 2018 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions. we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. as a result of completing step 1, all of our reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, step 2 of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units. for illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each of our reporting units been lower by 10%, all of our reporting units would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
at september 29, 2018, we believe that our reporting units, with goodwill aggregating $2.50 billion, were not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts.
since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the dcf, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return. in the dcf as the wacc increases, the fair value decreases. the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of our products, primarily medical imaging systems, aesthetic treatment systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on its medical imaging systems.
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. generally, our product arrangements for capital equipment sales, primarily in its breast health, medical aesthetics and skeletal health reporting segments, are multiple-element arrangements, including services, such as installation, training and support and maintenance, and multiple products. based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements, we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as the delivered products have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis. accordingly, revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product delivery are deferred and recognized as such services are performed. the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered. there is no customer right of return in the company's sales agreements for its capital equipment.
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty, installation and training, and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed. service and other revenue also includes royalties which are recognized in the period the payments are due to the company.
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within the

company's control. some of our products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the product's essential functionality. we determined that except for our computer-aided detection ("cad") products and c-view and intelligent 2d products, the software element in its other products is not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, asc 985-605, software-revenue recognition. we determined that given the significance of the software component's functionality to its cad, c-view and intelligent 2d components, which are sold by its breast health segment, these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. we evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of it hardware products, including its dimensions digital mammography systems, which have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products' essential functionality (i.e., it is a tangible product), and determined they are not within the scope of asc 985-605.
we are required to allocate revenue to its multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each element's selling price. we typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling prices ("esp") and services based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price ("vsoe"). we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. in determining vsoe, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. we also consider the class of customer, method of distribution, and the geographies into which its products and services are sold when determining vsoe. if vsoe cannot be established, which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent, or product pricing is not within a relatively narrow range, we will generally establish the selling price using esp to allocate arrangement consideration. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross margin objectives, method of distribution, information gathered from experience in customer negotiations, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies.
for those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules, asc 985-605 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value. if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element, the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements. for multiple-element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post-contract customer support ("pcs") has been established, we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
while the majority of our instruments are placed at customer sites, in certain instances we sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and records sales of these instruments upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the arrangement.
within our diagnostics business, and to a lesser extent, its gyn surgical business, we provide our instrumentation (for example, the thinprep processor, thinprep imaging system, and the panther and tigris systems) and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease. we install the instrumentation or equipment at the customer's site and recover the cost of providing the instrumentation or equipment in the amount we charge for its diagnostic tests, assays and other disposables. customers enter into a customer usage agreement and typically commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests, assays and other disposable products are shipped or delivered, depending on the customer's arrangement.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc 740, income taxes. under this method, we recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities at each reporting period. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws applicable to the period in which we expect the differences to affect taxable income. we establish a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
we have recognized $485.3 million in net deferred tax liabilities at september 29, 2018 and $964.5 million at september 30, 2017. the significant reduction was primarily due to implementing the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), which reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. we have recorded provisional amounts as of september 29, 2018 representing our best estimate based on interpretations of the act but we are continuing to accumulate data to finalize the underlying calculations, or in certain cases, the u.s. treasury is expected to issue further guidance on the application of certain provisions of the act. the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and debt. the tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. while

we have considered future taxable income and the character of such income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
at september 29, 2018, we had $89.5 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $79.0 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. at september 30, 2017, we had $90.3 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest, of which $70.3 million, if recognized, would have reduced the company's effective tax rate. the gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $0.8 million from fiscal 2017, of which $10.4 million was the reversal in fiscal 2018 of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to the convertible debt exchange that occurred in fiscal 2013 and $9.6 million was the net expense recorded to the income tax provision primarily from current year tax positions partially offset by audit settlements and expiring statutes of limitations. in the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that the company will reduce its gross unrecognized tax benefits by up to $4.8 million due to expiring statutes of limitations.
in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. in our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. while we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

executive summary this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (management's discussion) analyzes our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and those of our subsidiaries. it also includes management's analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. see "note regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially.
management's discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
we are an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. we generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations.
refer to the "business" section under item 1 of this annual report and note 22, "segments of business," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.
our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on long-term infrastructure investment programs. these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. additionally, we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner. refer also to the discussion of electric supply within our electric operations segment discussion for additional information on our long term electric generation strategy.
greater lawrence incident: the greater lawrence incident occurred on september 13, 2018. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded a loss of approximately $757 million for third-party claims and approximately $266 million for other incident-related expenses in connection with the greater lawrence incident. the amounts set forth above do not include the estimated capital cost of the pipeline replacement described below and as set forth in " - e. other matters - greater lawrence pipeline replacement."
we estimate that total costs related to third-party claims as set forth in note 18, "other commitments and contingencies - c. legal proceedings," will range from $757 million to $790 million, depending on the final outcome of ongoing reviews and the number, nature, and value of third-party claims. we expect to incur a total of $330 million to $345 million in other incident-related costs.
we also expect to incur expenses for which we cannot estimate the amounts of or the timing at this time, including expenses associated with government investigations and fines, penalties or settlements with governmental authorities in connection with the greater lawrence incident.
columbia of massachusetts recorded $135 million for insurance recoveries during 2018. of this amount, $5 million was collected during 2018. we are currently unable to predict the amount and timing of future insurance recoveries. to the extent that we are not successful in collecting reimbursement in the amount recorded for such recoveries as of december 31, 2018, it could result in a charge to earnings.

columbia of massachusetts paid approximately $167 million for the replacement of the entire affected 45-mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to those impacted in the greater lawrence incident during 2018. we estimate this replacement work will cost between $220 million and $230 million in total. columbia of massachusetts has provided notice to its property insurer of the greater lawrence incident and discussions around the claim and recovery have commenced. the recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding. the outcome of such a proceeding is uncertain. if at any point columbia of massachusetts concludes it is probable that any portion of this capital investment is not recoverable through customer rates, that portion of the capital investment, if estimable, would be immediately charged to earnings.
as discussed in note 8, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, columbia of massachusetts withdrew its petition for a base rate revenue increase, resulting in delayed increases in forecasted revenues and cash flows beginning the first quarter of 2019.
additionally, as discussed in note 6, "goodwill and other intangible assets," we concluded the greater lawrence incident was a triggering event requiring a quantitative analysis of goodwill for the columbia of massachusetts reporting unit. while no impairment of the goodwill balance was recorded in 2018, future unfavorable events that transpire at columbia of massachusetts could trigger the need for another quantitative analysis and a goodwill impairment loss would be required if it's determined columbia of massachusetts fair value is less than its book value.
refer to note 18-c and e, "legal proceedings" and "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, "summary of consolidated financial results," "results and discussion of segment operation - gas distribution operations," and "liquidity and capital resources" in this management's discussion, and part i. item 1a. "risk factors" for additional information related to the greater lawrence incident.
summary of consolidated financial results our operations are affected by the cost of sales. cost of sales for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. cost of sales for the electric operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal, related handling costs, natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity.
the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues. as a result, we believe net revenues, a non-gaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization), provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability. the presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. net revenues do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable gaap measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

on a consolidated basis, we reported a loss to common shareholders of $65.6 million or $0.18 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $128.5 million or $0.39 per basic share for the same period in 2017. the decrease in net income during 2018 was primarily due to expenses related to the greater lawrence incident restoration, dilution resulting from preferred stock dividend commitments and other changes in operating income, as discussed below, partially offset by the effects of implementing the tcja and higher losses on early extinguishment of long-term debt expenses in 2017.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018, we reported operating income of $124.7 million compared to $921.2 million for the same period in 2017. the decreased operating income was primarily due to increased operation and maintenance expenses related to the greater lawrence incident, decreased net revenues resulting from tcja impacts on revenue and increased depreciation due to capital expenditures placed in service. these increases were partially offset by higher rates from infrastructure replacement programs and base-rate proceedings, decreased outside service costs and employee and administrative expenses, as well as net favorable effects of year-over-year weather variations, which increased revenue in 2018.
other deductions, net other deductions, net reduced income by $355.3 million in 2018 compared to a reduction in income of $478.2 million in 2017. this change is primarily due to lower losses on early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2018 of $66.0 million, an interest rate swap settlement gain in 2018 of $46.2 million and higher actuarial investment returns resulting from pension contributions made in 2017. these favorable variances were partially offset by charitable contributions of $20.7 million in 2018 related to the greater lawrence incident.

income taxes on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the tcja, which, among other things, enacted significant changes to the internal revenue code, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including the continuation of certain interest expense deductibility and excluding 100% expensing of capital investments. these changes are effective january 1, 2018. gaap requires the effect of a change in tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment. as a result, in december 2017, nisource recorded a $161.1 million net increase in tax expense related primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards.
the decrease in income tax expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily attributable to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, true-ups to tax expense in 2018 to reflect regulatory outcomes associated with excess deferred income taxes, the effect of amortizing the regulatory liability associated with excess deferred income taxes and lower pre-tax income resulting from expenses incurred for the greater lawrence incident.
refer to "liquidity and capital resources" below and note 10, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate.
capital investment in 2018, we invested approximately $1.8 billion in cash capital expenditures across the gas and electric utilities. these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system, the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement, construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining our existing electric generation fleet.
we continue to execute on an estimated $30 billion in total projected long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments and expect to invest approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion in capital during 2019 to continue to modernize and improve our system across all seven states of our operating area.
liquidity as discussed in further detail below in "liquidity and capital resources," the tcja has and will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity. additionally, expenses paid for the greater lawrence incident are expected to have a short term negative impact on liquidity as recoveries from insurance lag behind our cash outlay. liquidity will also be negatively impacted to the extent certain costs associated with the greater lawrence incident are not recovered from insurance. through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under our short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, long-term debt agreements and our ability to access the capital markets, we believe there is adequate capital available to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures and the effects of the greater lawrence incident in 2019 and beyond. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately $974.6 million and $998.9 million, respectively, of net liquidity available, consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities.
these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of "results and discussion of segment operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
regulatory developments in 2018, we continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states of our operating area. refer to note 8, "regulatory matters" and note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of key regulatory developments that transpired during 2018.

comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are generally offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.
2018 vs. 2017 operating income for 2018, gas distribution operations reported an operating loss of $254.1 million, a decrease in income of $804.2 million from the comparable 2017 period.
net revenues for 2018 were $2,160.2 million, an increase of $63.1 million from the same period in 2017. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate proceedings of $99.6 million.
•   higher revenues from the effects of colder weather in 2018 of $37.5 million.
•   the effects of customer growth and increased usage of $17.4 million.
•   higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $16.0 million.
partially offset by:
•   a revenue reserve of $85.0 million in 2018 resulting from the probable future refund of certain collections from customers as a result of the lower income tax rate from the tcja.
•   decreased rates from implementation of regulatory outcomes related to the tcja of $24.7 million.
operating expenses were $867.3 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017. this change was primarily driven by:
•   expenses related to third-party claims and other costs following the greater lawrence incident of $864.4 million, net of insurance recoveries recorded.
•   increased depreciation of $29.6 million due to regulatory outcomes of nipsco's gas rate case and higher capital expenditures placed in service.
•   higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $16.0 million.
•   increased property taxes of $11.0 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service and the impact of regulatory-driven property tax deferrals.
partially offset by:
•   decreased outside services of $33.2 million primarily due to it service provider transition and other strategic initiative costs in 2017, lower ongoing it costs and a temporary shift of resources to the greater lawrence incident restoration.
•   lower employee and administrative expenses of $30.2 million driven by reduced incentive compensation and a temporary shift of resources to the greater lawrence incident restoration.
2017 vs. 2016 operating income for 2017, gas distribution operations reported operating income of $550.1 million, a decrease of $19.6 million from the comparable 2016 period.
net revenues for 2017 were $2,097.1 million, an increase of $161.9 million from the same period in 2016. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $124.2 million.
•   higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $26.9 million.
•   the effects of increased customer growth of $10.3 million.
•   higher revenues from increased industrial usage of $5.8 million.
operating expenses were $181.5 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016. this change was primarily driven by:
•   increased employee and administrative expenses of $53.4 million.
•   higher outside service costs of $52.8 million due to it service provider transition costs, increased spend on strategic initiatives to enhance safety, reliability and customer value and higher pipeline maintenance expenses.
•   increased regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $26.9 million.
•   higher depreciation of $15.2 million due to increased capital expenditures placed in service.

•   increased property taxes of $8.1 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service and an accrual adjustment recorded in 2016.
•   higher environmental costs of $4.7 million.
•   increased materials and supplies expenses of $3.4 million from maintenance-related activities.
weather in general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations. heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2018 was about 1% warmer than normal and about 13% colder than 2017, increasing net revenues $37.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017.
weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2017 was about 12% warmer than normal and about 4% warmer than 2016, decreasing net revenues $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2018 were 1,053.6 mmdth, compared to 973.2 mmdth for 2017. this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2018 compared to 2017.
total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31, 2017 were 973.2 mmdth, compared to 971.7 mmdth for 2016.
economic conditions all of our gas distribution operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. gas costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings.
certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. these programs serve to further reduce our exposure to gas prices.

comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.
2018 vs. 2017 operating income for 2018, electric operations reported operating income of $386.1 million, an increase of $18.7 million from the comparable 2017 period.
net revenues for 2018 were $1,206.1 million, a decrease of $66.5 million from the same period in 2017. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   lower regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $35.6 million.
•   decreased rates from implementation of regulatory outcomes related to the tcja of $32.9 million.
•   decreased industrial usage of $17.1 million.
•   a revenue reserve of $16.2 million in 2018 resulting from the probable future refund of certain collections from customers as a result of the lower income tax rate from the tcja .
•   increased fuel handling costs of $7.3 million.
partially offset by:
•   the effects of warmer weather of $25.2 million.
•   increased rates from infrastructure replacement programs of $18.6 million.
operating expenses were $85.2 million lower in 2018 than 2017. this change was primarily driven by:
•   lower regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $35.6 million.
•   lower outside service costs of $32.1 million and lower material and supplies costs of $10.2 million primarily related to the retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8 on may 31, 2018.
•   decreased employee and administrative costs of $18.4 million.
partially offset by:
•   increased depreciation of $10.0 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service.
2017 vs. 2016 operating income for 2017, electric operations reported operating income of $367.4 million, an increase of $66.1 million from the comparable 2016 period.
net revenues for 2017 were $1,272.6 million, an increase of $106.0 million from the same period in 2016. the change in net revenues was primarily driven by:
•   new rates from base-rate proceedings of $63.6 million.
•   increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects of $24.2 million.
•   higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $18.0 million.
•   new rates from infrastructure replacement programs of $6.0 million.
•   the effects of increased customer count of $3.4 million.
partially offset by:
•   the effects of cooler weather of $16.1 million.
operating expenses were $39.9 million higher in 2017 than 2016. this change was primarily driven by:
•   higher outside service costs of $20.1 million, primarily due to increased spend on strategic initiatives to enhance safety, reliability and customer value, generation-related maintenance, it service provider transition costs and vegetation management activities.
•   higher employee and administrative costs of $19.2 million.
•   increased regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $18.0 million.

•   increased depreciation of $5.6 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service.
•   higher materials and supplies costs of $4.5 million driven by generation-related maintenance.
partially offset by:
•   plant retirement costs of $22.1 million in 2016.
•   decreased amortization of regulatory assets of $10.8 million.
weather in general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days. our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of electric operations. heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison weather in the electric operations' territories for 2018 was 46% warmer than normal and 41% warmer than the same period in 2017, increasing net revenues $25.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017.
weather in the electric operations' territories for 2017 was 4% warmer than normal and 15% cooler than the same period in 2016, decreasing net revenues $16.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
sales electric operations sales were 16,448.0 gwh for 2018, a decrease of 277.6 gwh, or 1.7% compared to 2017. this decrease was primarily attributable to higher internal generation from large industrial customers in 2018, partially offset by increased volumes for residential and commercial customers resulting from warmer weather.
electric operations sales were 16,725.6 gwh for 2017, a decrease of 105.6 gwh, or 0.6% compared to 2016.
bp products north america. on march 29, 2018, wce, which is currently owned by bp p.l.c ("bp") and bp products north america, which operates the bp refinery, filed a petition at the iurc asking that the combined operations of wce and bp be treated as a single premise, and the wce generation be dedicated primarily to bp refinery operations beginning in may 2019 as wce has self-certified as a qualifying facility at ferc. bp refinery plans to continue to purchase electric service from nipsco at a reduced demand level beginning may 2019. refer to note 8, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
economic conditions nipsco has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs. fuel costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings.
nipsco's performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. nipsco's mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 49.67% and 54.5% of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
electric supply bailly generating station. nipsco completed the retirement of units 7 and 8 at bailly generating station on may 31, 2018. these units had a generating capacity of approximately 460 mw. the remaining net book value of the retired units is presented in "regulatory assets (noncurrent)" on the consolidated balance sheets. this balance continues to be amortized at a rate consistent with its inclusion in customer rates. the ongoing recovery of our remaining investment in these units will be addressed in nipsco's rate case filed on october 31, 2018. refer to note 8, "regulatory matters," and note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
nipsco 2018 integrated resource plan. multiple factors, but primarily economic ones, including low natural gas prices, advancing cost effective renewable technology and increasing capital and operating costs associated with existing coal plants, have led

electric operations (continued)
nipsco to conclude in its october 2018 integrated resource plan submission that nipsco's current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous integrated resource plan's had indicated.
the integrated resource plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years. the preferred option within the integrated resource plan retires r.m. schahfer generating station (units 14, 15, 17, and 18) by 2023 and michigan city generating station (unit 12) by 2028. these units represent 2,080 mw of generating capacity, equal to 72% of nipsco's remaining capacity after the retirement of bailly units 7 and 8 in may of 2018.
the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas. refer to note 18-e, "other matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

liquidity and capital resources greater lawrence incident: as discussed in the "executive summary" and note 18, "other commitments and contingencies," we have recorded losses associated with the greater lawrence incident and have invested capital to replace the entire affected 45-mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to the impacted area. as discussed in the executive summary and note 18 referenced earlier in this paragraph, and part i, item 1a "risk factors," in this report, we may incur additional expenses and liabilities in excess of our recorded liabilities and estimated additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident. the timing and amount of future financing needs arising from the greater lawrence incident, if any, will depend on the ultimate timing and amount of payments made in connection with the greater lawrence incident and the timing and amount of associated insurance recoveries. through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under our short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, term loan borrowings, long-term debt agreements and our ability to access the capital markets, we believe there is adequate capital available to fund these expenditures.
operating activities net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $540.1 million, a decrease of $202.1 million from 2017. this decrease was driven by cash spend for the greater lawrence incident in 2018 offset by decreased pension plan contributions as discussed below as well as decreased operation and maintenance expenses (excluding expenses related to the greater lawrence incident). the decrease in cash from operations was further offset by higher sales due to colder weather during the 2018 winter heating season compared to 2017 and increased rates from infrastructure replacement programs and rate case outcomes.
greater lawrence incident. during 2018, we paid approximately $731 million in operating cash flow related to the greater lawrence incident. refer to note 18-e "other matters" for further information.
pension and other postretirement plan funding. in 2017, we contributed $282.3 million to our pension plans (including a $277 million discretionary contribution made during the third quarter of 2017) and $31.6 million to our other postretirement benefit plans.
in 2018, we contributed $2.9 million to our pension plans and $21.0 million to our other postretirement benefit plans. given the current funded status of the pension plans, and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of our plan assets, we do not believe additional material contributions to our pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future.
income taxes. rates for our regulated customers include provisions for the collection of u.s. federal income taxes. the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tcja has led to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates, ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities. as discussed in further detail in note 7, "regulatory matters," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our regulated subsidiaries are engaged with the relevant state utility commissions to address the impacts of the tcja on future customer rates. during 2018, billings to customers decreased approximately $57.6 million compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of adjustments to certain rates in our kentucky, ohio, maryland, pennsylvania, massachusetts and indiana jurisdictions. additionally, during 2018, we recorded additional tcja-related regulatory liabilities related to 2018 collections from customers, which are being refunded back to customers once new customer rates are approved by our regulators.
in addition, we will be required to pass back to customers "excess deferred taxes" which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which, as a result of the passage of the tcja, are now less than the originally billed amounts. approximately $1.5 billion of excess deferred taxes was recorded to "regulatory liabilities (noncurrent)" on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2017 as a result of implementing the tcja. the majority of this balance related to temporary book-to-tax differences on utility property protected by irs normalization rules. as modified rates are approved by each of our regulators, we expect this portion of the balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property as required by the tcja. the pass back period for the remainder of this balance will be determined by our state utility commissions in future proceedings. our estimate of the amount and pass-back period of excess deferred taxes is subject to change pending final review by the utility commissions of the states in which we operate. as noted above, this pass back of excess deferred taxes has already begun in certain of our jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2018 we have approximately $1.4 billion of remaining regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes. see note 8, "regulatory matters," for additional information.
as of december 31, 2018, we had a recorded deferred tax asset of $759.6 million related to a federal nol carryforward, of which $508.5 million relates to years prior to the implementation of the tcja. as a result of being in an nol position, we were not

required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the three years ended december 31, 2018. the carryforward periods for pre-tcja tax benefits expire in various tax years from 2028 to 2037, however, we expect to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration. per the tcja, utilization of nol carryforwards generated after december 31, 2017 do not expire, but are limited to 80% of current year taxable income. accordingly, we may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having nol carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable.

for 2018, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,814.6 million, which was $60.8 million higher than the 2017 capital program. this increased spending is due in part to costs associated with the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement, gas transmission projects, environmental investments and system modernization projects.
for 2017, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,753.8 million, which was $263.4 million higher than the 2016 capital program. this increased spending is mainly due to electric transmission projects, environmental investments and system modernization projects.
for 2019, we project to invest approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion in our capital program. this projected level of spend is consistent with 2018 spend levels and is expected to focus primarily on the continuation of the modernization projects, segment growth across the gas distribution operations segment, and tdsic spend.

(1) long-term debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of $68.5 million.
(2) capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $114.6 million.
(3) operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term. the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term, but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above. expected payments are $26.7 million in 2019, $22.4 million in 2020, $16.6 million in 2021, $12.3 million in 2022, $9.3 million in 2023 and $8.8 million thereafter.
our calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt is based on the stated coupon and payment dates. for 2019, we project that we will be required to make interest payments of approximately $363.1 million, which includes $319.8 million of interest payments related to our long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2018, we had $1,977.2 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.
our expected payments included within "other liabilities" in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2019. plan contributions beyond 2019 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. in 2019, we expect to make contributions of approximately $3.0 million to our pension plans and approximately $20.6 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. refer to note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long-term obligations classified as "total other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, other than those described above.
we also have obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expect to make tax payments of approximately $240.6 million in 2019, which are not included in the table above.
refer to note 18-a, "contractual obligations," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
in january 2019, nipsco executed two 20 year ppas to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per mwh and a bta with a developer to construct a renewable generation facility. payments under these agreement are not included in the table above as these agreements were executed in 2019 and remain subject to approval by the relevant regulatory authorities before the deals would commence. see 18-e.

market risk disclosures risk is an inherent part of our businesses. the extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. we seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. risk management for us is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. these may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.
commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries' operations involving natural gas and power. to manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.
commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. if states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.
our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. the amount of these deposits, some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, term loan borrowings and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $13.3 million and $15.8 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances.
refer to note 9, "risk management activities," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.
credit risk due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy. in addition, risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations. credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. for derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.
we closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers. we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

other information critical accounting policies we apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements.
basis of accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries. asc topic 980, regulated operations, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were $2,237.5 million and $2,660.0 million at december 31, 2018, and $1,801.2 million and $2,795.6 million at december 31, 2017, respectively. for additional information, refer to note 8, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980, regulated operations. in such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980, regulated operations, we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 980-20, discontinuation of rate-regulated accounting. in management's opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980, regulated operations for the foreseeable future.
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $320.4 million at december 31, 2018. if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.
the passage of the tcja into law necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the new u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21%. for our regulated entities, substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, as appropriate, until such time that we receive final regulatory orders prescribing the required accounting treatment and related impact on future customer rates. for additional information, refer to note 10, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
as discussed in note 18-e, "other matters - greater lawrence pipeline replacement," we incurred approximately $167 million of capital spend for pipeline replacement in the affected communities during 2018. we estimate this replacement work will cost between $220 million and $230 million in total. columbia of massachusetts has provided notice to its property insurer of the greater lawrence incident and discussions around the claim and recovery have commenced. the recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding. the outcome of such a proceeding is uncertain. in accordance with asc 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. this could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.
pension and postretirement benefits. we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in gaap as the "corridor" method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.

the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aa-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets.
for measurement of 2019 net periodic benefit cost, we selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 6.10% and 5.80% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively.
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.
we use the society of actuaries' most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:

in january 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. this change, compared to the previous method, resulted in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. historically, we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. for fiscal 2017 and beyond, we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see note 11, "pension and other postretirement benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
goodwill. we have seven goodwill reporting units, comprised of the seven state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment. our goodwill assets at december 31, 2018 were $1,690.7 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1, 2000.
as required by gaap, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1, 2018. in the third quarter of 2018, we determined the greater lawrence incident represented a triggering event that required an impairment analysis of goodwill. the incident specifically impacts our columbia of massachusetts reporting unit. the quantitative impairment analysis as of september 30, 2018 determined the fair value of columbia of massachusetts reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying value. for additional information, refer to note 6, "goodwill and other intangible assets," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
we completed a quantitative ("step 1") fair value measurement of our reporting units during the may 1, 2016 goodwill test. consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach. a qualitative ("step 0") test was completed on may 1, 2018. we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in our baseline may 1, 2016 test. the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary.
the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions.
the long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. the long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the u.s. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates.
the may 1, 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values, indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test. if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested, holding all other assumptions constant.
revenue recognition. revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed.
we adopted the provisions of asc 606 beginning on january 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, which was applied to all contracts. no material adjustments were made to january 1, 2018 opening balances and no material changes in the amount or timing of future revenue recognition occurred as a result of the adoption of asc 606. refer to note 3 "revenue recognition," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

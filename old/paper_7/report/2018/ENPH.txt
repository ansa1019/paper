item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties. in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "intend," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. for example, statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance, expense levels and liquidity sources are forward-looking statements. our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.
overview and 2018 highlights we are a global energy technology company, delivering smart, easy-to-use solutions that connect solar generation, storage and communications management on one intelligent platform. we revolutionized solar with our microinverter technology and produce the world's only truly integrated solar-plus-storage solution. we have shipped more than 19 million microinverters, representing over 4 gigawatts of solar pv generating capacity, and more than 855,000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 125 countries.
we sell our solutions primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. we also sell directly to large installers, oems, strategic partners and homeowners. over the last three years, revenues generated from the u.s. market have represented 69% to 80% of our total revenue.
our first commercial shipment occurred in mid-2008. our net revenues were $316.2 million, $286.2 million and $322.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we incurred net losses of $11.6 million, $45.2 million and $67.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, we had $106.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $75.1 million.
our 2018 priorities included focusing on customer service and achieving our financial operating model. quality and customer service are the cornerstones of our strategy and were instrumental in our turnaround in financial performance in 2018. we began by focusing on call center metrics in the u.s., europe and australia, and reduced the average wait time from over 10 minutes in 2017 to approximately 2 minutes by the end of 2018. we introduced self-service tools such as the service-on-the-gotm that allow our installers and partners to submit requests from their phone in less than 60 seconds.
our financial operating model sets gross margin, operating expense and operating income targets expressed as a percentage of net revenue. our financial operating model explicitly focuses on profitability rather than market share. we are pleased with the progress towards achieving our financial operating model targets for gross margin, operating expenses and operating income, which we achieved through a combination of disciplined planning and rigorous execution.
the launch of iq 7 worldwide, the smallest, lightest and most powerful microinverter we have ever made, was a key factor in improving gross margin. every region of the world where our products are sold is now using this seventh-generation microinverter. in the fourth quarter of 2018, 84% of our microinverter shipments were iq 7. we systematically rolled out high-power and high-efficiency variants of the iq 7 microinverters in 2018. selling these variants simultaneously improved gross margin and delivered a better price per watt for the installer.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $106.2 million in cash, as compared to $29.1 million as of december 31, 2017. in february 2018, we raised $20.0 million through a private placement of common stock and also reached an agreement with our lender to defer approximately 50% of the principal payments due in 2018 under our term loans. the amount deferred in 2018 was amortized over the remaining term of the loan. on january 28, 2019, we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. in august 2018, we sold $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 in a private placement and received net proceeds of $62.4 million, after deducting the underwriters' fees and other issuance costs. see note 11. "debt," and note 13. "sale of common stock," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.

on august 9, 2018, we completed the purchase of assets primarily relating to sunpower's microinverter business (the "business"). upon the closing of the transactions under the apa on august 9, 2018, we acquired intellectual property, technology and other assets primarily relating to the business and assumed certain intellectual property and customer relationship of the business for the following consideration: (i) $25.0 million payable in cash; and (ii) 7.5 million shares of our common stock issued to sunpower at closing. in addition, as conditions to the closing, we and sunpower entered into (i) a msa under which sunpower is obligated to exclusively procure module level power electronics and related equipment for use in the u.s. residential market from us for a period of five years and (ii) a stockholders agreement to establish certain sunpower rights and obligations related to the shares issued, including sunpower's right to appoint one person to our board of directors, certain additional transfer restrictions on the shares, and voting, standstill and other undertakings by sunpower. see note 20. "acquisition," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
2019 outlook we believe our solid execution in 2018 positions us well to take advantage of future growth opportunities, and we need to maintain our focus in order to capitalize on such opportunities. our top three priorities for 2019 are customer experience, improvement of internal business processes and continued focus on the vectors for profitable top line growth.
customer experience. quality and customer service constitute customer experience. on the service front, our installer, distributor and module partners are our first line of association with our ultimate customer, the homeowner and business user. our goals are to partner better with these service providers so that we can provide exceptional serve to our homeowner. we are convinced that continued customer experience improvements can be a competitive advantage for us.
improve internal business processes. there are three critical business processes we are focusing on this year: operational business process for streamlining the quote to cash cycle; new product business process for launching new product predictably; and human resource business process for talent management. these processes are critical in improving every aspect of our company for sustainable long-term profitable growth.
profitable top line growth. our four vectors for our goal of achieving profitable top line growth are iq 7 regional expansion, high-power and high-performance products, acms, and ensemble solar and storage technology.
•   our iq 7 transition is nearly complete. component shortages in 2018 limited our ability to meet customer demand, and we expect these shortages to alleviate in 2019 allowing us to fully realize the financial benefits of this product in the second half of 2019.
•   we expect to introduce high-power products, including iq 7a, which cater to 375-450w dc panels, much like the iq 7+ and iq 7x which cater to 325-400w dc panels in 2019. in early 2019, we have started sampling the iq 7a product in limited quantities to one of our lead customers.
•   enphase energized acms represent a significant part of our strategy to achieve profitable top line growth. this plug and play solution allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation time, faster inspection and training. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began volume shipments of our iq 7xstm, with a continued ramp in 2019.
•   ensemble solar and storage technology represents a complete system that provides homeowners with new levels of choice and energy independence. we expect to release ensemble grid-agnostic products in a phased manner starting in the fourth quarter of 2019. while there will be limited financial contribution from ensemble in 2019, we will be preparing the market, aligning customers and educating homeowners for an expected robust 2020 with this technology.
components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we primarily generate net revenues from sales of our solutions and related accessories, which can include our ac battery storage systems, our envoy communications gateway and enlighten cloud-based monitoring service as well as other accessories.

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our solutions and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. we contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the u.s., europe and asia.
gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost, product mix, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories other than restructuring expense and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation.
research and development expense include personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense include personnel-related expenses, travel, trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. we currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the u.s., canada, mexico and central american markets, europe, australia, new zealand, india and certain other asian markets. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense include personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organization, facilities costs, and fees for professional services. fees for professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
- 40 -
restructuring charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2016‐2017 (the "2016 plan") and 2018 (the "2018 plan") to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expenses. under the 2016 plan, costs included in restructuring primarily consisted of fees paid to management consultants engaged to assist us in making organizational and structural changes to improve operational efficiencies and reduce expenses, severance for workforce reduction actions, non-cash charges related to the disposition of assets and impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves. the net charge for the 2016 plan included a gain on the divestiture of our services business. charges related to our 2016 plan were largely completed in 2017. under the 2018 plan, costs included in restructuring primarily consisted of employee severance and one-time benefits, workforce reorganization charges, non-cash charges related to impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves. see note 10. "restructuring," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
other expense, net other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense and commitment fees under our term loans and convertible notes, and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs. other expense, net also includes gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into u.s. dollars.
income tax benefit (provision)
we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the u.s. because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the u.s. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the u.s., we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. as of december 31, 2018, due to the history of losses we have generated in the u.s. since inception, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that all of our u.s. and state deferred tax assets will not be realized.

2018 compared to 2017. net revenues increased by 10% in 2018, as compared to 2017, due primarily to an increase in the average selling price per inverter combined with $5.3 million of revenue earned under a joint development agreement. we sold 2.8 million microinverter units in 2018, as compared to 2.9 million units in the same period in 2017. the impact of the lower sales volume was more than offset by an increase in average selling price per microinverter due to the transition to our iq series of microinverters and pricing management. see note 3. "revenue recognition," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
2017 compared to 2016. net revenues decreased by 11% to $286.2 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. the number of microinverter units sold decreased by 6% to approximately 2.9 million units in 2017 in part due to our efforts to improve gross margins, which included foregoing low-margin sales. net revenues decreased year-over-year primarily due to the lower volume combined with a decline in the average selling prices of our products. the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by the recognition of $2.2 million of deferred revenue resulting from a change in estimate of the service period related to sales of our envoy product.

2018 compared to 2017. cost of revenues decreased by 4% in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to an 11% decrease in the average product cost. gross margin increased by 10.3 percentage points for 2018, as compared to 2017. the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased product margins as a result of the transition to our iq 7 microinverter as well as our other product cost management efforts. the improvement in margin due to the $5.3 million in revenue under a joint development arrangement was offset by an increase in other cost of goods sold, including increased expedite fees and logistics costs associated with supply constraints due to industry wide component shortages. our ability to reduce product costs and the timing of product cost reductions relative to declines in the selling prices of our products can have a significant impact on our gross margin.
2017 compared to 2016. cost of revenues decreased by 13% in 2017, as compared to 2016, and was primarily attributable to the transition in 2017 to our next generation iq microinverters, which have a lower cost profile than the previous generation, as well as the decline in sales volume. gross margin increased by 1.6 percentage points to 19.6% in 2017, as compared to 18.0% in 2016. the primary drivers of the gross margin increase were lower warranty expense and logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016.

2018 compared to 2017. research and development expense decreased by $0.6 million in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. the decrease is due to lower personnel-related expenses, equipment costs and professional expenses associated with the development, introduction and qualification of new products. the decrease was partially offset by higher engineering expenses. the decrease in personnel-related expenses was primarily due to a cumulative decrease in labor costs associated with moving certain functions to lower cost locations as part of restructuring actions taken in 2017 and 2018. the decrease in personnel-related expenses was partially offset by higher bonus compensation, stock-based compensation expense and travel expenses. the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity.
2017 compared to 2016. research and development expenses decreased by $17.5 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated non-core projects resulting in an $11.5 million reduction in research and development personnel related expenses and a $5.9 million reduction in lab parts, product prototypes and professional fees.

2018 compared to 2017. sales and marketing expense increased by $3.9 million in 2018, as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses, professional fees, equipment costs, advertising and marketing expenses and bad debt expenses. the increase was partially offset by lower facilities costs. the increase in personnel-related expenses include higher stock-based compensation expense, payroll expenses due to increasing our sales team and recruiting fees. the increase in personnel-related expenses was partially offset by lower spending on contractors and temporary employees, bonus compensation and benefits.
2017 compared to 2016. sales and marketing expenses decreased by $15.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative resulting in an $8.5 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a $1.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. bad debt expense was reduced by $2.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, and advertising and professional fees were reduced by $2.8 million.

2018 compared to 2017. general and administrative expense increased by $6.9 million in 2018, as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses, additional consulting and advisory fees due to our first year of sox compliance efforts, $1.8 million paid to resolve a dispute with a supplier, and $0.8 million of acquisition-related expenses. the increase was partially offset by lower legal fees and equipment costs. the increase in personnel-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher stock-based compensation expense, higher spending on contractors and temporary employees, salary and bonus compensation and travel expenses. the increase in personnel-related expenses was partially offset by lower employee recruitment costs.
2017 compared to 2016. general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.2 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated non-core projects resulting in a $4.9 million reduction in general and administrative personnel related expenses, a $0.8 million reduction in facilities related expenses and a $1.0 million reduction in depreciation expense as a result of a lower fixed asset base. these decreases were partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounting and legal fees.

2018 compared to 2017. we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2018 to lower our operating expenses. this plan included a realignment of our global workforce to lower cost locations and a relocation of our corporate headquarters. restructuring charges for 2018 primarily included $2.2 million in cash-based severance and related benefits, $1.6 million in charges for assets impairment, and $0.3 million for lease loss reserves. we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in the near-term under this restructuring plan.
2017 compared to 2016. we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2016 to lower our operating expenses and cost of revenues that included reductions in our global workforce and the elimination of certain non-core projects. in 2017 we engaged a management consulting firm to assist us in making organizational and structural changes to improve operational efficiencies and reduce expenses. restructuring charges in 2017 include $12.1 million of consulting services, $2.8 million in cash-based severance and related benefits and $2.0 million in charges for asset impairments and lease loss reserves.

2018 compared to 2017. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act"), which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered our u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. by operation of law, we applied a u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for 2018. the effective tax rate in 2018 of (13.67)% was lower than the 2018 statutory u.s. federal income tax rate due primarily to global low-taxed intangible income ("gilti") inclusion, foreign taxes and compensation deduction limitations. the change in effective tax rate in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to changes in valuation allowances, and foreign taxes having a greater impact on the effective tax rate and an increase in non-deductible expenses, both a result of the act.
the income tax provision of $1.4 million in 2018, compared to the income tax benefit of $0.1 million in 2017, was primarily due to increased foreign taxes and decreased benefit from tax reform.
2017 compared to 2016. the company's effective tax rates of 0.33% and (2.24)% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, differed from the statutory rate of 34% in 2017 and 2016, due primarily to changes in valuation allowance needs, foreign taxes and impact of tax reform in 2017. the income tax benefit of $0.1 million in 2017, compared to the income tax provision of $1.5 million in 2016, was primarily due to changes in foreign taxes and benefit from tax reform in 2017.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2018, we had $106.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $75.1 million. cash and cash equivalents held in the u.s. were $93.7 million and consisted primarily of u.s. government money market mutual funds and non-interest-bearing checking deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. we consider amounts held outside the u.s. to be accessible and have provided for the estimated u.s. income tax liability associated with our foreign earnings.

convertible debt. in august 2018, we sold $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 (the "convertible notes"). the notes are senior, unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 4.0% per year, payable semi-annually on february 1 and august 1 of each year, beginning on february 1, 2019. the convertible notes will mature on august 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders. we may not redeem the convertible notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. as of december 31, 2018, $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes was outstanding. see note 11. "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
in february 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which we, in a private placement, issued and sold to the investor 9,523,809 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $2.10, resulting in gross proceeds of $20.0 million.
term loans. in july 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners, llc, which was subsequently amended and modified in 2017 and 2018 ("term loans"). as of december 31, 2018, we have $41.5 million outstanding on our term loans. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the term loan agreement. on january 28, 2019, we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. see note 11. "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion on the term loans.
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months.
cash flows. the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):

cash flows from operating activities for 2018, net cash provided by operating activities of $16.1 million was primarily due to adjustments for non-cash items more than offsetting the net loss of $11.6 million. the net cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 was a $23.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $9.7 million decrease in inventory and a $1.5 million increase in warranty obligations. offsetting the cash provided was a $13.5 million increase in accounts receivable, a $10.0 million increase in intangible assets related to our acquisition of sunpower's microinverter business, a $6.1 million decrease in deferred revenues and a $3.1 million increase in contract assets.
for 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $28.4 million, primarily resulted from a net loss of $45.2 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $6.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $9.0 million, asset impairment and non-cash restructuring charges of $1.1 million, and a provision for doubtful accounts of $0.5 million. changes in net operating assets and liabilities used cash of $1.4 million.
the primary uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2017 were a $6.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $4.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $1.6 million decrease in warranty obligations. offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in inventory of $6.0 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $5.3 million.
for 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $33.0 million, primarily resulted from a net loss of $67.5 million. the net loss was partially offset by non-cash charges including stock-based compensation of $10.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $10.6 million, asset impairment and restructuring charges of $3.2 million, and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of $3.1 million. in addition, the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $7.2 million.

(1)   on january 28, 2019, we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees. see note 11. "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
(2)   purchase obligations include amounts related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturer procures on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
as of 2018, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, including associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.3 million. since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty, liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 15. "income taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway, the cloud-based enlighten monitoring service, and ac battery storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners.
- 48 -
on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards codification ("asc") no. 606, "revenue recognition" ("asc 606" or "topic 606") and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of january 1, 2018. the most significant impacts upon adoption of topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized. the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period.
revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers. a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows.
•   products delivered at a point in time. we sell our products to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts. we generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway and enlighten service, communications accessories and ac battery storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. microinverter units, microinverter accessories, and ac battery storage solutions are delivered to customers at a point in time, and we recognize revenue for these products when we transfer control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.
•   products delivered over time. the sale of an envoy communications gateway includes our enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period. we also sell certain communication accessories that are delivered over time. the revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period.
we previously sold envoy communications device to certain customers under a long-term financing arrangement. under this financing arrangement, we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue.
we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded.
we record upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. for contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred. commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue.
see note 3. "revenue recognition," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information related to revenue recognition.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). in cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market. the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not material.

warranty obligations microinverters sold through december 31, 2013
our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product's warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters). on a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability. this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e., failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e., claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e., replacement cost).
estimated failure rates - our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure ("mtfb") estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters, third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a microinverter fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
estimated claim rates - warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
estimated replacement costs - three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time (between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
in addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences. we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. if actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1, 2014
our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. under asc 825, "financial instruments" (also referred to as the "fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. see note 9. "fair value measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
business combinations assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires us to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. accounting for business acquisitions requires us to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract, meaning that it includes other transaction components. this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction.
adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.

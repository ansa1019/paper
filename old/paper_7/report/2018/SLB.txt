the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under "item 1a. risk factors" of this form 10-k.
2018 executive overview schlumberger full-year 2018 revenue of $32.8 billion increased 8% over 2017. this revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased activity in north america against a backdrop of increasing oil prices throughout most of the year.
in the oil markets, sentiment was stable and positive for the first three quarters of 2018, providing a rising oil price environment. oecd crude and product stocks continued a downward trend that began in the third quarter of 2016. production cuts from opec and russia in 2017 served to strengthen the oil price. activity picked up globally and, as oil reached its peak price for the year in october, production from major producers, including unconventional us production, began to surprise to the upside. output in libya rebounded sharply; saudi arabia and the united arab emirates each recorded record production output; and dispensations from the iran export sanctions generated aggregate production that more than offset declines elsewhere.
as a result, the market became oversupplied at the beginning of the fourth quarter despite the anticipated slowdown in the permian basin production growth due to capacity takeaway constraints. this, coupled with concerns about global oil demand, caused oil prices to plummet by more than 40% during the fourth quarter of 2018 and led to a sudden and sharp decrease in us land well completion activity during the final months of the year.
in the natural gas markets, consumption of liquified natural gas ("lng") continued to rise enabled by vast sources of new supply. the us became a lng exporter in 2016, when the first shipment left sabine pass in louisiana. us export capacity grew to 37 million tonnes in 2018 and is set to nearly double in 2019. underground gas storage in the us was below average through most of 2018, however, rising gas production from unconventional oil and gas wells in the us northeast, midcontinent and the permian basin helped to keep henry hub prices well below international prices. this will allow the us to join australia and the middle east as significant exporters.
schlumberger financial performance in 2018 was driven largely by north america, where revenue of $12.0 billion grew 26% year-over-year, despite the steep fall-off in activity during the fourth quarter of the year.  this growth was driven by increased land activity that primarily benefited schlumberger's onestim business, where revenue grew 41%.
full-year 2018 international revenue of $20.4 billion was essentially flat  compared with 2017.  during the third quarter of 2018, international revenue grew faster than north america revenue for the first time since 2014, marking the beginning of a positive activity trend after three consecutive years of declining revenue.  this was driven by the increased activity of national oil companies ("nocs"), as they began to invest in longer-term resource development following a sustained period of deep underinvestment and declining production.
the dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by higher-than-expected us shale production as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year, and as geopolitics negatively impacted the global demand- and supply-balance sentiments. the combination of these two factors, together with a large sell-off in the equity markets due to concerns around global growth and increasing us interest rates, created a near-perfect storm to close out 2018.
looking ahead to 2019, schlumberger expects a more positive supply- and demand-balance sentiment to lead to a gradual recovery in the price of oil over the course of the year, as the opec and russia production cuts take full effect; the effect of lower activity in north america land in the second half of 2018 impacts production growth; the dispensations from the iran export sanctions expire and are not renewed; and as the us and china continue to work toward a solution to their ongoing trade dispute.
in the meantime, the recent oil price volatility has introduced more uncertainty around the global exploration and production ("e&p") spending outlook for 2019, with customers generally taking a more conservative approach at the start of the year.  however, based on recent discussions with customers, schlumberger is seeing clear signs that e&p investments are starting to normalize and reflect a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base. for the north america land e&p operators, this means that future investments will likely be much closer to the level that can be covered by free cash flow. conversely, in the international markets apart from the middle east and russia, after four years of underinvestment and a focus on maximizing cash flow, the nocs and independents are starting to see the need to invest in their resource base simply to maintain production at current levels.
this means that even with the current oil price levels, schlumberger expects solid, single-digit growth in the international markets, while in north america land the increased cost of capital and focus on aligning investments closer to free cash flow has introduced more uncertainty to the outlook for both drilling and production activity.

fourth-quarter revenue of $8.2 billion declined 4% sequentially driven by lower activity and pricing for most production- and cameron-related businesses in north america land. lower revenue from onesubsea also contributed to the decline. international activity remained resilient despite the oil price drop, with revenue increasing 1% sequentially. the seasonal slowdown in russia was offset by increased revenue in the middle east, asia and africa. revenue from europe and latin america was flat compared with the previous quarter.   sequential performance was heavily impacted by production- and cameron-related activity declines in north america land, as seen by the 12% sequential decrease of revenue in north america. onestim revenue dropped 25% sequentially as a number of fleets were warm-stacked during the latter part of the quarter, and as schlumberger focused on securing dedicated contracts for the first half of 2019 early in the fourth-quarter tendering cycle.
reservoir characterization fourth-quarter revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 1% sequentially driven by the seasonal decline in wireline activity in russia, lower wireline exploration activity offshore north america, and reduced onesurface activity in the middle east. these effects were partially offset by year-end sales of sis software.
reservoir characterization pretax operating margin of 22% was essentially flat compared with the previous quarter as the effect of high-margin sis software sales was offset by the seasonal decline in higher-margin wireline revenue.
drilling fourth-quarter revenue of $2.5 billion increased 1% sequentially driven primarily by international growth in drilling & measurements and m-i swaco, while drilling revenue remained resilient in north america land.
drilling pretax operating margin of 13% decreased 105 basis points ("bps") sequentially due to a seasonal activity decline in russia and the increased cost of mobilizing additional resources as ids project activity scaled up across international operations.
production
14
fourth-quarter revenue of $2.9 billion declined 10% sequentially. onestim revenue in north america land dropped 25%, accounting for the vast majority of the production revenue decrease, as a number of fleets were warm-stacked during the latter part of the quarter  due to market oversupply conditions.
production pretax operating margin of 7% decreased 310 bps sequentially due to reduced pricing and activity in the onestim business in north america land.
cameron cameron revenue of $1.3 billion declined 3% sequentially as increased international sales in surface systems were more than offset by lower revenue from the onesubsea and valves & measurement product lines.  onesubsea booked more than $600 million in new project orders during the fourth quarter of 2018, indicating that it is now close to the cycle trough of backlog-driven activity.
cameron pretax operating margin of 10% declined 140 bps sequentially due to lower onesubsea margins.

full-year 2018 revenue of $32.8 billion increased 8% year-on-year and grew for the second successive year. performance was driven by north america where revenue of $12.0 billion increased 26% due to the onestim business, which grew by 41%. full-year international revenue of $20.4 billion was essentially flat compared with 2017.
full-year 2018 pretax operating income of $4.2 billion grew 7% year-on-year. pretax operating margin of 13% was essentially flat with the previous year, as the impact of higher revenue was offset by reactivation and mobilization costs associated with the ramp-up and strategic positioning for increased activity in both north america and internationally.
reservoir characterization full-year 2018 revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 4% year-on-year primarily due to reduced onesurface revenue following the end of the first phase of an integrated production system project in the middle east and reduced westerngeco activity as marine seismic acquisition contracts wound down during 2018 following the fourth quarter 2017 decision to cease all future marine seismic acquisition activities after satisfying schlumberger's remaining commitments.
15
year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 303 bps to 21% primarily as a result of reduced depreciation and amortization following the westerngeco impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
drilling full-year 2018 revenue of $9.3 billion increased 10% year-on-year primarily due to higher demand for directional drilling technologies on land in north america and the start of new integrated drilling projects internationally. this benefited drilling & measurements, bits & drilling tools, m-i swaco and integrated drilling services.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin declined 32 bps to 13%.
production full-year 2018 revenue of $12.4 billion increased 17% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in north america that benefited the onestim pressure pumping businesses in north america land for the first three quarters of 2018. growth was driven by the deployment of additional hydraulic fracturing capacity, market share gains, operational efficiency improvements and improved pricing.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin declined 32 bps to 8%.
cameron full-year 2018 revenue of $5.2 billion decreased 1% year-on-year.  a 15% revenue increase in the short-cycle business of surface systems, driven by higher north america land activity, was offset by a 12% decline in the long-cycle onesubsea business.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin of 12% declined 232 bps due primarily to the decline in high-margin onesubsea project volumes.

full-year 2017 revenue of $30.4 billion increased 9% year-on-year.  this included a full year of activity from the acquired cameron businesses versus nine months of activity for the same period in 2016.  excluding the impact of cameron, revenue increased 7% year-
16
on-year.  the growth was primarily driven by north america, where the land rig count increased more than 80% versus the same period last year.
full-year 2017 pretax operating margin was expanded 111 bps to 13%, as improved profitability in north america due to the land activity growth that benefited production and drilling was offset by margin declines in reservoir characterization and cameron.
reservoir characterization full-year 2017 revenue of $6.8 billion increased 2% year-on-year primarily due to higher westerngeco and wireline revenue on projects in the middle east & asia area, north america land, russia and mexico.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 18%.
drilling full-year 2017 revenue of $8.4 billion decreased 2% year-on-year primarily due to the rig count declines internationally and in offshore north america combined with pricing pressure.  revenue also declined as a result of schlumberger's decision in april 2016 to reduce its activities in venezuela to align operations with cash collections.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 210 bps to 14% primarily due to improved profitability in north america due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing. this improvement was partially offset by the negative impact of reduced activity in venezuela.
production full-year 2017 revenue of $10.6 billion increased 21% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in north america that benefited the pressure pumping business which grew 44%. lower spm production levels in ecuador partially offset the revenue increase.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 298 bps to 9% as a result of improved profitability in north america due to the accelerated land activity and improved pricing.  this was partially offset by reduced margins in spm due to lower production in ecuador.
cameron cameron contributed full-year revenue of $5.2 billion.  cameron revenue for 2016 included only nine months of revenue following the april 2016 closing of the acquisition. revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog, particularly for the long-cycle businesses of drilling systems and onesubsea.
year-on-year, pretax operating margin of 14% decreased 142 bps as a result of lower drilling systems project volumes.

the decrease in interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to lower cash and short-term investment balances.
interest expense interest expense of $575 million in 2018, $566 million in 2017 and $570 million in 2016 has been essentially flat.

research & engineering costs have decreased in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue over the past two years as a result of cost control measures.
income taxes the schlumberger effective tax rate was 17% in 2018, (28)% in 2017, and 15% in 2016.
the schlumberger effective tax rate has historically been sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases, the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases. conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases, the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases.
as discussed in further detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on december 22, 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the "act").  the act, which is also commonly referred to as "us tax reform," significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries.
the effective tax rate for each of 2017 and 2016 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements because they were only partially tax-effective.  excluding the impact of these charges and credits, the effective tax rate was 17% in 2018, 18% in 2017 and 16% in 2016.  the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017, excluding the impact of charges and credits, was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform.  the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the impact of charges and credits, was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as the percentage of pretax earnings generated in north america increased compared to 2016.
charges and credits schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2018, 2017 and 2016. these charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)   "net debt" represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. net debt is a non-gaap financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.

(2)   includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and spm investments.

(3)   includes severance payments of approximately $340 million during 2018, $455 million during 2017 and $850 million during 2016.

(4)   "free cash flow" represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, spm investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.

key liquidity events during 2018, 2017 and 2016 included:
•   cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion in 2018, $5.7 billion in 2017 and $6.3 billion in 2016. operating cash flows for 2018 were essentially flat compared to 2017 as the lower consumption of working capital was offset by decreased depreciation and amortization following the asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. the improvement in working capital in 2018 was largely driven by strong accounts receivable collections. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 was largely attributable to lower earnings before consideration of non-cash charges and credits and depreciation and amortization expense.

•   on july 18, 2013, the board approved a $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by june 30, 2018. this program was completed during may 2017. on january 21, 2016, the board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for schlumberger common stock. schlumberger had repurchased $723 million of schlumberger common stock under this program as of december 31, 2018.

the following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2018, 2017 and 2016:

•   dividends paid during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.8 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

•   capital expenditures were $2.2 billion in 2018, $2.1 billion in 2017 and $2.1 billion in 2016. capital expenditures during 2019 are expected to range between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion.

•   during the fourth quarter of 2018, schlumberger issued €600 million of 1.00% guaranteed notes due 2026.

•   during the fourth quarter of 2018, schlumberger completed the divestiture of its marine seismic acquisition business for net proceeds of $579 million (after considering $21 million of cash divested).

•   during the fourth quarter of 2017, schlumberger issued $500 million of 2.20% guaranteed notes due 2020 and $600 million of 2.65% guaranteed notes due 2022.

●   during 2018, 2017 and 2016, schlumberger made contributions of $83 million, $133 million and $174 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. the us pension plans were 88% funded at both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 based on their projected benefit obligations.

schlumberger's international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 97% funded at both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 based on their projected benefit obligations.
schlumberger expects to contribute approximately $25 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2019, subject to market and business conditions.

•   the increase in spm investments in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to the purchase of a majority non-operating interest in the palliser block, located in alberta, canada, from cenovous energy.

•   schlumberger paid $2.8 billion of cash in connection with its 2016 acquisition of cameron. additionally, as a result of the acquisition of cameron, schlumberger assumed $3.0 billion of debt (including a $244 million adjustment to increase cameron's long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair value) and acquired $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments.

•   during the second quarter of 2016, schlumberger repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of cameron's long-term fixed-rate debt.

•   in connection with schlumberger's 2016 acquisition of cameron, cameron was merged with schlumberger holdings corporation ("shc"), an indirect wholly-owned united states subsidiary of schlumberger. under the terms of the agreement, cameron shareholders received 0.716 shares of schlumberger limited common stock and a cash payment of $14.44 in exchange for each cameron share of common stock outstanding. in connection with this transaction, shc acquired approximately 138 million shares of common stock from schlumberger limited and transferred those shares to cameron's shareholders.

in order to partially fund the purchase of the 138 million shares of common stock from schlumberger limited that were transferred to cameron stockholders, shc issued $6 billion of notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 consisting of the following:
-   $500 million of 1.90% senior notes due 2017;

-   $1.3 billion of 2.35% senior notes due 2018;

-   $1.6 billion of 3.00% senior notes due 2020;

-   $850 million of 3.63% senior notes due 2022; and

-   $1.75 billion of 4.00% senior notes due 2025.

as of december 31, 2018, schlumberger had $2.8 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. schlumberger also has separate committed credit facility agreements aggregating $6.5 billion with commercial banks, of which $4.1 billion was available and unused as of december 31, 2018. the $6.5 billion of committed credit facility agreements support commercial paper programs. schlumberger believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2018 and $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2017.

refer to note 18, pension and other benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
as discussed in note 14, income taxes, of the consolidated financial statements, included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2018 is approximately $1.4 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business. due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
22
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc.  these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. the following accounting policies involve "critical accounting estimates" because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain.
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value.  judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve.  allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices.  adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of schlumberger's customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments.
as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable.  during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables.  however, except as described below, schlumberger has not had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn.  schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries.   as of december 31, 2018, only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of schlumberger's net receivables balance, of which only one (the united states) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables.
in april 2016, schlumberger announced that it was reducing its activity in venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments on outstanding receivables.  schlumberger also previously disclosed that its judgment regarding the collectibility of its receivables and promissory notes in venezuela is sensitive to the political and economic conditions in the country and that, if conditions in venezuela worsen, schlumberger may be required to record adjustments to the carrying value of these assets.  during the fourth quarter of 2017, conditions in venezuela further deteriorated such that schlumberger determined it was appropriate to write-off the remaining outstanding receivable balance of approximately $469 million and record an impairment charge of $105 million related to the aforementioned promissory notes.
goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger's reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred.
under generally accepted accounting principles, schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. however, if schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.
schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2018. based on this assessment, schlumberger concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. accordingly, no further testing was required.
23
long-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in spm projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  in reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.  if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value.  the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management.  if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.
income taxes schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. schlumberger's tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. however, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. in such an event, schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs.
revenue recognition for certain long-lived construction-type contracts schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  approximately 5% and 7% of schlumberger's revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively, was recognized under this method.
the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete.  due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses.  any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.
multiclient seismic data schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data.  the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $601 million and $727 million, respectively.  such costs are charged to cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data.  however, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value.
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred.  adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys.  significant adverse changes in schlumberger's estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.  for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a survey-by-survey basis.
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger's pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. these assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events.
the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans:
●   the discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger's united states pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 4.30% at december 31, 2018 and 3.70% at december 31, 2017.

24
●   the weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger's international pension plans was 4.00% at december 31, 2018 and 3.55% at december 31, 2017.

●   the weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger's united states pension plans and postretirement medical plan decreased from 4.20% in 2017 to 3.70% in 2018.

●   the weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger's international pension plans decreased from 4.13% in 2017 to 3.55% in 2018.

the expected rate of return for schlumberger's retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. the expected rate of return for schlumberger's united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 7.25% in both 2018 and 2017. the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 7.40% in both 2018 and 2017. a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense.
schlumberger's medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2018 postretirement medical expense was 7.00%, graded to 5.0% over the next nine years. the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31, 2018 was 7.00%, graded to 5.0% over the next nine years.

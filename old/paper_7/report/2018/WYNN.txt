item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the results presented reflect the company's adoption of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition ("asc 606"), effective january 1, 2018. certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of asc 606, with no impact to operating income, net income or adjusted property ebitda.
overview we are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts). in macau, we own approximately 72% of wml, which includes the operations of the wynn palace and wynn macau resorts. in las vegas, nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of wynn las vegas. we are currently constructing encore boston harbor, an integrated casino resort in everett, massachusetts.
key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the consolidated statements of income are presented. these key operating measures are defined below:
•   table drop in mass market for our macau operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•   table drop for our las vegas operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•   rolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our macau operations' vip program.
•   turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•   table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues. table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•   slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•   average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied.
•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
•   occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.
in our vip operations in macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the rolling chips in the vip operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip play using this rolling chip method. we expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%. in our mass market operations in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the measurements from our vip and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our vip operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement from the vip operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the vip operations when compared to the mass market operations.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. the cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in las vegas. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage in las vegas is 22% to 26%.

for the year ended december 31, 2017, adjusted property ebitda was $1.81 billion, an increase of 43.8%, or $551.4 million, from $1.26 billion for the same period of 2016. the increase in adjusted property ebitda was the result of increases of $424.5 million, $79.2 million, and $47.7 million from wynn palace, wynn macau and our las vegas operations, respectively.

the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in vip turnover and table drop at wynn palace. the increase at wynn palace was partially offset by decreases at wynn macau and our las vegas operations. the decrease at wynn macau was primarily driven by a lower vip table games win percentage. the decrease at our las vegas operations was primarily driven by a conversion of wholly owned retail outlets to leased retail outlets in december 2017 and lower table games win percentage. the following table presents operating revenues from our casino and non-casino revenues (dollars in thousands):

total operating expenses increased primarily due to a litigation settlement expense of $463.6 million, and an increase of $408.7 million at wynn palace, which primarily related to increased gaming taxes commensurate with increased casino revenues.
casino expenses increased $363.0 million at wynn palace, partially offset by a decrease of $45.0 million at wynn macau. our las vegas operations were relatively flat. the increase in casino expenses was primarily driven by gaming taxes commensurate with an increase in casino revenue at wynn palace.

food and beverage expenses increased $20.1 million, $7.8 million and $16.1 million at wynn palace, wynn macau, and at our las vegas operations, respectively. the increases at wynn palace and wynn macau were commensurate with food and beverage revenue increases. the increase at our las vegas operations was primarily driven by increased payroll costs and higher costs for entertainment at wynn las vegas nightclubs.
entertainment, retail and other expenses increased $6.9 million and $1.6 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, offset by a decrease of $21.9 million at our las vegas operations. the decrease at our las vegas operations was primarily driven by a conversion of wholly owned retail outlets to leased retail outlets and the closure of the golf course in december of 2017. the increase in expenses at wynn palace and wynn macau was commensurate with the increase in entertainment, retail and other revenues.
general and administrative expenses increased $18.8 million, $9.5 million, and $12.2 million, at wynn palace, wynn macau and our las vegas operations, respectively. these increases were attributable to increased payroll costs at our macau operations and increased payroll and advertising costs at our las vegas operations. corporate and other general and administrative expenses increased $35.4 million, primarily as a result of increased legal expenses and a fine of $20.0 million assessed by the ngc on february 26, 2019, in connection with the conclusion of an ngcb investigation which had commenced in 2018.
litigation settlement expense of $463.6 million was incurred in connection with the repayment of the redemption note for claims related to the allegedly below-market interest rate of the redemption note. for more information, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 15, "commitments and contingencies."
the provision for doubtful accounts was $6.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with a benefit of $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the benefit in the prior year was due to the collection of certain casino accounts receivable resulting in the reversal of previously recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. the balance can fluctuate due to the

impact of historical collection patterns and current collection trends, as well as the specific review of customer accounts, on our estimated allowance for the respective periods.

interest costs increased due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average debt balance. capitalized interest increased due to encore boston harbor construction activities.
other non-operating income and expenses we incurred losses of $69.3 million and $59.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from the change in fair value of the redemption note prior to its repayment in march 2018. for more information on the methodology
43
and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the redemption note, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies." during the first quarter of 2018, we repaid the $1.94 billion principal amount of the redemption note.
we recorded a $0.1 million net gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2018 related to the repayment of the redemption note, offset by a loss on debt extinguishment associated with the amendment of the wynn macau credit facilities. we incurred a loss of $55.4 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our 5 3/8% first mortgage notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes") and issued our 5 1/4% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 wlv notes"). we also completed a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our 5 1/4% senior notes ("2021 notes") and issued our 4 7/8% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 wml notes") and 5 1/2% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 wml notes"), together (the "wml notes"). we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $20.8 million in connection with the 2022 notes and 2027 wlv notes transactions and $33.1 million in connection with the wml notes transactions. additionally, in connection with an amendment of our wynn america credit facilities, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million.
we incurred losses of $4.1 million and $21.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from foreign currency remeasurements. the losses were primarily due to the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the macau pataca, in relation to the u.s. dollar, on the remeasurements of u.s. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our macau-related entities.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded tax benefits of $497.3 million and $329.0 million, respectively. during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company finalized its analysis of u.s. tax reform, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and further clarified by guidance issued by the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of 2018. the guidance addressed the treatment of foreign-sourced royalties and the allocation of interest expense and other expenses to foreign source income. as a result, the company adjusted its valuation allowance for ftc carryovers in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a net tax benefit of $390.9 million, which is incremental to the $339.9 million provisional net tax benefit recorded in 2017 associated with u.s. tax reform.
wynn macau sa received a five-year exemption from the macau complementary tax on casino gaming profits through december 31, 2020. for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we were exempt from the payment of $96.8 million and $63.0 million, respectively, in such taxes. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.

we have participated in the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap") for the 2012 through 2018 tax years and will continue to participate in the irs cap for the 2019 tax year.
in february 2017 and 2018, the irs completed an examination of our 2015 and 2016 u.s. tax return, respectively, and had no changes.
in march 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of wynn macau sa. in july 2018, the financial services bureau issued final tax assessments for the company for the years 2013 and 2014. while no additional tax was due, adjustments were made to the company's tax loss carryforwards.

total operating expenses increased primarily due to increased casino, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses, offset by decreased pre-opening expenses, all primarily related to the opening of wynn palace.
casino expenses increased $835.7 million and $116.5 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million at our las vegas operations. the increase at wynn macau was driven by gaming taxes, which increased commensurate with the increase in casino revenues.
rooms expenses increased $29.6 million and $8.3 million at wynn palace and our las vegas operations, primarily attributable to expenses associated with the increase in occupancy and an increase in labor costs.
food and beverage expenses increased $57.9 million and $16.2 million at wynn palace and our las vegas operations, partially offset by wynn macau, which decreased $5.6 million. the increase from our las vegas operations was primarily driven by an increase in labor costs.
entertainment, retail and other expenses increased primarily due to a full year of operations at wynn palace.
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a full year of operations at wynn palace.
the provision for doubtful accounts was a benefit of $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to an expense of $8.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the change was due to the collection of certain casino accounts receivable that resulted in the reversal of previously recorded allowance for doubtful accounts.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred pre-opening expenses of $25.9 million related to encore boston harbor and $0.2 million related to our las vegas operations. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred $129.8 million related to wynn palace, $22.7 million related to encore boston harbor, and $2.3 million related to our las vegas operations.
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to a full year of depreciation for wynn palace, which was placed in service in august 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred property charges and other expenses of $12.6 million and $6.7 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, respectively, primarily due to abandonment charges and asset retirements associated with various renovation projects and estimated costs related to property damage caused by a typhoon that impacted macau. in addition, we incurred $10.6 million in charges from our las vegas operations primarily related to miscellaneous renovations. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred a $15.5 million exit fee for the right to procure energy for our las vegas operations from

for the year ended december 31, 2017, interest costs increased primarily due to an increase in the weighted average total debt balance. the increase in the weighted average total debt balance was primarily driven by borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities. capitalized interest decreased primarily due to the completion of wynn palace construction activities in august of 2016, and a $25.6 million out-of-period adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2016. during the first quarter of 2016, we corrected immaterial amounts of additional interest that should have been capitalized instead of being expensed during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
other non-operating income and expenses we recorded a loss of $59.7 million and a gain of $65.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the change in fair value of the redemption note. the change in fair value was a result of changes in certain variables used to calculate its estimated fair value.
we recorded a gain of $1.1 million and a loss of $0.4 million from the change in the fair value of derivatives for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
interest income was $31.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $13.5 million for the same period of 2016. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investment amounts were in fixed deposits and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a tax expense of $329.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively. our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily related to a provisional tax benefit of $339.9 million resulting from the impact of u.s. tax reform on the company's deferred taxes. our income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to an increase in our deferred tax liabilities.
wynn macau sa received a five-year exemption from the macau complementary tax on casino gaming profits through december 31, 2020. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we were exempt from the payment of $63.0 million and $27.3 million, respectively, in such taxes. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.
49
in august 2016, wynn macau sa received an extension of its agreement with the macau government that provides for an annual payment of 12.8 million macau patacas (approximately $1.6 million) as complementary tax due by stockholders on dividend distributions. this agreement on dividends is effective through december 31, 2020.
we have participated in the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap") for the 2012 through 2018 tax years and will continue to participate in the irs cap for the 2019 tax year. in february 2017 and 2018, the irs completed an examination of our 2015 and 2016 u.s. tax return, respectively, and had no changes.
in march 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of wynn macau sa. as of december 31, 2017, we believed no changes to the unrecognized tax benefits were required.
in july 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of palo real estate company limited ("palo"), a subsidiary of wynn macau sa. in february 2018, the financial services bureau concluded its examination with no changes.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $142.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $60.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from wml.
adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, change in derivatives fair value, change in redemption note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses. adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike net income, adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
the following table summarizes adjusted property ebitda (in thousands) for our macau and las vegas operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 16, "segment information." that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited.

adjusted property ebitda at wynn palace increased 60.0% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017. since opening in august 2016, wynn palace has experienced significant business volume increases in both vip and mass market operations during its first two full years of operations. wynn palace operated for the final 132 days of 2016, which does not compare meaningfully to 2017.
adjusted property ebitda at wynn macau decreased 3.6% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in vip win as a percentage of turnover, partially offset by increases in mass market table games win and slot machine win. adjusted property ebitda at wynn macau increased 11.6% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to improved vip operations driven by a year-over-year increase in vip turnover.
adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations decreased 10.6% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, primarily due to decreased table and slot win and increased operating expenses. adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations increased 10.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to improved casino operations and food and beverage operations.

operating activities our operating cash flows primarily consist of the operating income generated by our macau and las vegas operations (excluding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and payables. our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers who gamble on credit. the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted on a cash and credit basis. accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivable.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $961.5 million, compared to $1.88 billion for the same period of 2017. the decrease was primarily driven by a litigation settlement expense and a reduction in customer deposits at our macau operations.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $1.88 billion, compared to $970.5 million for the same period of 2016. the increase was primarily due to the operations of wynn palace, which generated $424.5 million of additional adjusted property ebitda, and a $292.8 million increase in customer deposits at wynn palace.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $1.22 billion, primarily attributable to $1.48 billion in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, driven by capital expenditures of $791.3 million related

57
we expect that our las vegas operations will fund wynn las vegas, llc's and the retail borrowers' operations, capital requirements and debt service obligations with existing cash and operating cash flows. however, we cannot assure you that our las vegas operations' operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. similarly, we expect that our macau operations will fund wynn macau sa and wml's debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flows and availability under the wynn macau credit facilities. however, we cannot assure you that our macau operations' operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. in addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. for information regarding legal proceedings, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 15, "commitments and contingencies."

we have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. the amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.
new business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. there can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. we may decide to conduct any such development through wynn resorts, limited or through subsidiaries separate from the las vegas or macau-related entities.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
development, construction and property and equipment estimates during the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. in connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.
during the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, estimates of the usage of the asset and other factors specific to the asset. depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs and fixed assets commence when the related assets are placed in service. the remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. the cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
we also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
redemption price promissory note we recorded the redemption note at its fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. as of december 31, 2017, the fair value of the redemption note was $1.88 billion. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the redemption note. in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk-free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used. the company repaid the principal amount in full on march 30, 2018.

allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our las vegas operations. while offered, the issuance of credit at our macau operations is less significant when compared to las vegas. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both las vegas and macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, 85.0% and 81.7%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in asia. in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.
we regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. in determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands):

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable              31,263                28,841
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable          13.6   %              16.6   %
our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, 57.9% and 42.4%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
as of december 31, 2018, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.3 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
litigation and contingency estimates we are subject to various claims, legal actions and other contingencies, and we accrue for these matters when they are both probable and estimable. for matters that arose on or prior to the balance sheet date, we estimate any accruals based on the relevant facts and circumstances available through the date of issuance of the financial statements. we include the accruals associated with any contingent matters in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2018, we have a foreign tax credit ("ftc") carryover of $3.19 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.49 billion against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. the ftcs are attributable to the macau special gaming tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. in the assessment of the valuation allowance, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecasts of future earnings and the duration of statutory carryforward periods.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

(1) represents consolidated noi and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliation.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, resident fees/services and rental income represented 69% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues.  substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, our commercial paper program, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from net operating income. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. at december 31, 2018, we had $215,376,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $100,753,000 of restricted cash and $1,853,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.
key transactions capital  the following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred and supported new investments made during the year ended december 31, 2018:
•   in april 2018, we issued $550,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028 for net proceeds of approximately $545,074,000.
•   in connection with the qcp acquisition, in july 2018, we drew on a $1,000,000,000 term loan facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other expenses.
•   in august 2018, we issued $200,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028, $600,000,000 of 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500,000,000 of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2048 for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,283,226,000. proceeds from these issuances were used to repay advances under the $1,000,000,000 term loan facility drawn on in july 2018 and the primary unsecured credit facility.
•   in july 2018, we closed on a new $3,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across both our line of credit and term loan facility and terminated the existing unsecured credit facility. the credit facility includes a $3,000,000,000 revolving credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.825% over libor, a $500,000,000 usd unsecured term credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.90% over libor and a $250,000,000 cad unsecured term credit facility at 0.90% over cdor.
•   we extinguished $306,553,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.36%.
•   we repaid our $450,000,000 of 2.25% senior unsecured notes at par upon maturity on march 15, 2018.
•   we raised $794,649,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our equity shelf program (as defined below).

dividends our board of directors announced the 2019 annual cash dividend of $3.48 per common share ($0.87 per share quarterly), consistent with 2018, beginning in february 2019. the dividend declared for the quarter ended december 31, 2018 represents the 191st consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the statement of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo"), consolidated net operating income ("noi") and same store noi ("ssnoi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

credit strength  we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and internal revenue code ("irc") section 1031 deposits. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations, and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

operating activities  the change in net cash provided from operating activities is attributable to changes in noi, which is primarily due to acquisitions and annual rent increasers, partially offset to dispostions. please see "results of operations" below for further discussion. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.
investing activities  the changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments, real estate loans receivable, and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 3, 6, and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position, and/or achieve property stabilization. generally, these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions, primarily in our seniors housing operating segment.
financing activities  the changes in net cash provided from financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 50%. we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. at december 31, 2018, we had fourteen outstanding letter of credit obligations. please see notes 7, 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
on may 17, 2018, we filed with the securities and exchange commission (1) an open-ended automatic or "universal" shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan ("drip") under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. as of february 13, 2019, 8,526,222 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the drip registration statement. on august 3, 2018, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with each of morgan stanley & co. llc; merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated; goldman sachs & co. llc; ubs securities llc and wells fargo securities, llc relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $784,083,001 aggregate amount of our common stock ("equity shelf program"). the equity shelf program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. we expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive per share cash proceeds at settlement equal to the forward sale price under the relevant forward sale agreement.  however, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. as of february 13, 2019, we had $227,958,000 of remaining capacity under the equity shelf program and there were no outstanding forward sales agreements. depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations summary our primary sources of revenue include resident fees/services,rent and interest income. our primary expenses include interest expense, depreciation and amortization, property operating expenses, other expenses and general and administrative expenses.  we evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: seniors housing operating, triple-net and outpatient medical. the primary performance measures for our properties are noi and ssnoi and other supplemental measures include ffo and adjusted ebitda, which are further discussed below.  please see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliations. the following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

fluctuations in resident fees/services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions, segment transitions and the movement of u.s. and foreign currency exchange rates. the fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. the decrease in other income for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily a result of insurance proceeds received during 2017 relating to a property as well as a bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property acquisition.
during the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. the fluctuations in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. beginning january 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized

the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. the fluctuations in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities are largely due to the recognition of impairments related to one of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2017. losses are also attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures.

the 2017 and 2018 decreases in rental income are primarily attributable to the disposition of properties exceeding new acquisitions, segment transitions and the reduction in the genesis healthcare ("genesis") annual cash rent obligation due to the restructuring of the master lease as of january 1, 2018. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index ("cpi") and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the cpi do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2018, we had 17 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.18% to 0.76% in our triple-net portfolio. the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during the three years presented. the increase in other income for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily due to $10,805,000 of net lease termination fees recognized.
depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties exceeding acquisition and segment transitions. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in "critical accounting policies" below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to genesis of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively.
during the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. the fluctuations in gains on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. beginning january 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price.

during the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed two triple-net construction projects totaling $90,055,000 or $283,472 per bed/unit and two expansion projects totaling $17,357,000. the following is a summary of triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees.  the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. the fluctuation in loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment recorded on the genesis available-for-sale investment in accordance with the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-01 described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. the following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

the fluctuations in rental income are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties, offset by dispositions. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the cpi. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if the cpi does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. for the three months ended december 31, 2018, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 77,850 square feet of new leases and 184,349 square feet of renewals. the weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $36.23 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $21.90 per square foot. substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 3.9%.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities, offset by dispositions. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. during 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed one outpatient medical construction project representing $11,358,000 or $296 per square foot. the following is a summary of outpatient medical construction projects pending as of december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments. please refer to note 10 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. the change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility. loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 is due to the term loan facility drawn on in july 2018 and paid off in august 2018.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 2.69%, 2.83% and 3.63%, respectively. the decrease in general and administrative expenses since 2016 is primarily related to a reduction in professional service fees for tax and legal consulting and compensation costs as a result of execution of our strategic initiatives.
other expenses for 2017 primarily represents $40,730,000 of costs related to finalization of an agreement with the university of toledo foundation to transfer our corporate headquarters as a donation. other expenses for all years also includes severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees.
the fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to benefits recognized in the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the release of a valuation allowance reserve on a taxable subsidiary and the restructuring of an unconsolidated investment. the decrease in preferred dividends and the preferred stock redemption charge are due to the redemption of our 6.5% series j preferred stock during the three months ended march 31, 2017.
other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics"), as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
consolidated net operating income ("noi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical facility properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses, and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to january 1, 2016. land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties acquired, developed /redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts. we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary unsecured credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements. failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed adjusted ebitda, which represents ebitda as defined above excluding unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to nics, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure, for the periods presented. noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/loss on real estate dispositions and impairments of assets.  amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:
•   the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
•   the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

entities are vies based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support. we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. in addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

on january 1, 2017, we adopted accounting standards update 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business ("asu 2017-01") which narrows the financial accounting standards board's ("fasb") definition of a business and provides a framework that gives entities a basis for making reasonable judgments about whether a transaction involves an asset or a business. asu 2017-01 states that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the acquired asset is not a business. if this initial test is not met, an acquired asset cannot be considered a business unless it includes an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. the primary differences between business combinations and asset acquisitions include recording the asset acquisition at relative fair value, capitalizing transaction costs, and the elimination of the measurement period in which to record adjustments to the transaction. we believe that substantially all our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions. we are applying asu 2017-01 prospectively for acquisitions after january 1, 2017. regardless of whether an acquisition is considered an asset acquisition or a business combination, the cost of real property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values. tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings, and improvements. the remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period interest.   we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. amortization periods for intangibles are based on the remaining life of the lease or lease-up period.

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. the determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans. if this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement or if it has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. to the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to income accrual status.

revenue is recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days' notice.   if our evaluation indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.

an impairment charge must be recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if it is determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.

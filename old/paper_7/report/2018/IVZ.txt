item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. this overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company" or "invesco") and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
global financial markets in 2018 saw a return of market volatility, and significant negative returns late in the year wiped out earlier gains in all markets. the year started much as the prior year had ended, with strong returns fueled by optimism around u.s. tax reform and positive macroeconomic data. however, increasing geopolitical uncertainty and rising global trade tensions, as well as concerns about the sustainability of global growth, came into sharper focus as the year progressed, ultimately leading markets lower.

in the u.s., strong earnings growth and employment data helped to propel the markets higher to start the year, while the accelerating potential for negative trade actions between the u.s. and china and concerns that the u.s. may be late in an economic cycle dampened market enthusiasm as the year progressed. the federal reserve's interest rate actions throughout the year and unwind of the accommodative monetary policy created further uncertainty, as they continued to raise interest rates while indicating that future pace of increases could be slowed or curtailed. the s&p 500 reached an all-time high in september before contracting sharply in the fourth quarter to finish the year down 7.0%.
european markets were similarly lifted early in the year on strong economic data and an improving growth outlook. the sentiment turned negative as the year progressed as rising geopolitical concerns (including the upcoming uk and eu separation, italian political concerns, and the ongoing trade tensions between the u.s. and china) and concerns around global growth intensified driving the ftse 100 down 12.4% for the year.
in japan, a positive economic outlook and weakening yen were offset by a slowdown in china's growth, and concerns about the impact to corporate profits led markets sharply lower late in the year. the nikkei 225 finished the year down 12.1%.
bond returns for the year were mixed as strong economic indicators and rate increases implemented in the u.s. and uk drove yields higher for a majority of the year, while the desire for lower-risk assets in the fourth quarter pressured yields on government bonds. concerns around liquidity and leverage and a weakening outlook for corporate profits negatively impacted corporate investment grade and high-yield credit, driving the u.s. aggregate bond index to finish down a modest 0.2% for the year.
the table below summarizes the year ended december 31 returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for 2018, 2017, and 2016:

the company's financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar, as discussed in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section and the "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 compared to december 31, 2016" section below.
our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields.
invesco benefits from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum. one of invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. the company has moved to a unified brand - invesco, while preserving the time-tested and distinctive investment perspectives, processes and approaches of our different investment teams across the globe. this effort will contribute to a more consistent client experience across multiple markets and strengthen our ability to market our comprehensive range of capabilities more effectively.
as announced in october 2018, invesco and massmutual have entered into a definitive agreement whereby invesco will acquire massmutual's asset management affiliate, oppenheimerfunds, inc. in turn, massmutual and the oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders will receive a combination of common and preferred equity consideration, and massmutual will become a significant shareholder of invesco, with an approximate 17% stake expected at closing. the transaction is on track to close in the second
31
quarter of 2019 (pending necessary regulatory and other third-party approvals). this strategic combination of highly complementary investment and distribution capabilities will strengthen the combined organization's ability to provide relevant investment outcomes to an expanded number of institutional and retail clients in the u.s. and around the globe.
under the terms of the agreement, invesco will acquire oppenheimerfunds with consideration to massmutual and oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders consisting of 81.9 million shares of invesco common equity and $4 billion in perpetual, non-cumulative preferred shares with a 21-year non-call period and a fixed rate of 5.9%. based on invesco's stock price as of december 31, 2018, this represents an estimated purchase price of $5.4 billion. the purchase and sale agreement contain customary purchase price adjustments related to net working capital and revenue run rate changes at the closing date. as of the date of this report, no such adjustment to the purchase price would be triggered. the purchase and sale agreement does not contain an adjustment to the purchase price based upon changes in the market valuation of aum.
since announcement, invesco and oppenheimerfunds have made significant progress toward achieving the post-close integration and targeted expense synergies of $475 million through a planned combination of middle- and back-office rationalization, location strategy and leveraging the scale of the global operating platform. as noted in october, bringing the two firms together will accelerate invesco's growth strategy and further strengthen our ability to meet client needs across the globe.
in october 2018, the company announced a common stock buyback program of $1.2 billion to be completed within the next two years, which will be financed through the strong operating cash flows of the combined invesco and oppenheimerfunds organization. for the purpose of repurchasing its shares, the company entered into a forward contract during the fourth quarter of 2018. under this contract, the counterparty purchased $300 million (14.4 million shares) of the company's shares in the fourth quarter. the shares are included as treasury shares in the company's balance sheet and reduced outstanding shares as of december 3, 2018. the company intends to repurchase an additional $100-$300 million prior to the closing of the oppenheimerfunds acquisition (depending on market conditions), with the remainder to be purchased by the end of 2020.
one of the company's strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business. during 2018, the company has continued our efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers, outsourcing, automating key processes and optimizing the company's office footprint. consistent with this objective, business optimization costs of $34.1 million and $58.0 million were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. total costs of these initiatives at completion are estimated to be approximately $160.0 million, of which $5.0 million remains to be incurred through 2019. at the end of 2018, these initiatives have produced annualized run-rate expense savings of approximately $56 million, and by completion in 2019, the annualized run-rate savings is expected to be up to $58.0 million.
invesco great wall fund management company ("invesco great wall"), the company's largest joint venture in china, is experiencing strong growth. invesco great wall is one of the largest sino-foreign managers of equity products in china, with aum of $26.9 billion as of december 31, 2018. the company has a 49% interest in invesco great wall. in june, invesco great wall's jingyi money market fund was selected as one of seven money market funds to be included in the money market program, yu'e bao, administered by ant financial, an affiliate of alibaba. given invesco's influence on invesco great wall, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter. the company's non-gaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows.
on april 6, 2018 the company completed its previously announced acquisition of guggenheim investments' exchange-traded funds (etf) business, which consists of $38.1 billion of assets under management (at date of acquisition). with this acquisition, invesco's etf assets under management total $199.8 billion globally (as of december 31, 2018). the aggregate purchase price paid by invesco upon completion of the transaction was $1.2 billion.
on june 4, 2018, the company acquired intelliflo, the no. 1 technology platform for financial advisors in the uk. the addition of intelliflo builds on the 2016 acquisition of jemstep to deliver a global, advisor-focused digital platform that enhances the firm's ability to meet evolving client needs.
invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources, such as jemstep, as we believe these areas are key to delivering superior investment experiences. the range of investment capabilities available through jemstep are broad across the firm's active, alternative and etf offerings. additionally, jemstep offers open
32
architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients. as a market-leading provider of digital solutions, jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence, and is an integral part of invesco's growth strategy.
presentation of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- impact of consolidated investment products the company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various retail mutual funds and similar entities, private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (clos), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. the company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10-k (report) as consolidated investments products (cip). cip includes all variable and voting interest entities, as applicable, with effect from the adoption of asu 2015-02. the company's economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 1 -- "accounting policies -- basis of accounting and consolidation."
the majority of the company's cip balances are clo-related. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the clos. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.
the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-gaap disclosures. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the assets under management discussion:
•   results of operations (years ended december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 compared to december 31, 2016);
•   schedule of non-gaap information;
•   balance sheet discussion; and
•   liquidity and capital resources.
to assess the impact of cip on the company's results of operations and balance sheet discussion, refer to part ii, item 8, financial statements, note 19, "consolidated investment products." the impact on the company's results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 was a reduction of $28.6 million. this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products.
wherever a non-gaap measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of non-gaap information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-gaap measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures to the non-gaap measures. to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company's income statements for the periods presented.

(1)   net revenues is a non-gaap financial measure. net revenues are operating revenues plus the net revenues of our joint venture investments, less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus management and performance fees earned from cip. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(2)   adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-gaap financial measures. adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. adjusted operating income includes operating income plus the net operating income of our joint venture investments, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, transaction, integration, and restructuring adjustments, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, and other reconciling items. see "schedule of non-gaap information," for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income.
(3)   adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures. adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. is net income attributable to invesco ltd. adjusted to exclude the net income of cip, transaction, integration, and restructuring adjustments, the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. adjustments made to net income attributable to invesco ltd. are tax-affected in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. by calculation, adjusted diluted eps is adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted eps). see "schedule of non-gaap information," for the reconciliation of net income attributable to invesco ltd. to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd..

foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations a significant portion of our business is based outside of the u.s. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, primarily the pound sterling, canadian dollar, euro and japanese yen will impact our assets, liabilities, aum and reported revenues and expenses from period to period. the assets, liabilities and aum of foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end spot foreign currency exchange rates. the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates.
the table below sets forth the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation of non-u.s. dollar denominated asset, liabilities and aum into u.s. dollars:

assets under management the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum. passive aum include index-based etfs, unit investment trusts (uits), non-management fee earning aum, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. active aum is total aum less passive aum.
non-management fee earning aum includes invesco qqq, uits and product leverage. the net flows in non-management fee earning aum can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield.
the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as long-term. long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements.

(1)   in 2018, reinvested distributions are shown in a separate line in the aum tables. for periods prior to the third quarter of 2017, reinvested distributions are included in market gains and losses.
(2)   gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum, excluding invesco great wall aum. prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments. given the company's influence on invesco great wall, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter of 2018. our share of the average aum in 2018 for our jvs in china was $16.2 billion (2017: $8.5 billion, 2016: $9.2 billion). it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum, because the revenues resulting from these aum are not presented in our operating revenues. under u.s. gaap, our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income. additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from cip; however, the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products. therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from aum.
(3)   net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
(4)   during 2018, a net $0.5 billion of passive etf aum were reclassified to active aum.
(5)   as of july 1, 2018, we began including 100% of invesco great wall, which added $9.5 billion in aum in 2018. the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business on april 6, 2018 added $38.1 billion in aum in 2018. the acquisition of the european etf business added $26.0 billion in aum in 2017.
37
flows there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows.
average aum during the year ended december 31, 2018, were $958.7 billion, compared to $875.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 (december 31, 2016: $788.8 billion).
market returns and reinvested distributions market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis, during 2018, global markets saw a return of market volatility and significant negative returns late in the year wipe out earlier gains in all markets. see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum.
foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2018, we experienced decreases in aum of $12.5 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates (december 31, 2017: aum increased by $21.4 billion; december 31, 2016: aum decreased by $22.1 billion). see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2018 in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.
acquisitions and dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business, which added $38.1 billion in aum at date of purchase and we began including 100% of invesco great wall fund management company which added $9.5 billion in aum during the year. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the european etf business, which added $26.0 billion in passive etf aum (including approximately $7.0 billion of externally managed aum) at date of purchase. for the year ended december 31, 2016, dispositions of $2.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by invesco mortgage capital inc. (ivr) and other aum dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of invesco asset management (india) private limited, which added $2.4 billion to aum.
revenue yield as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the u.s., changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of u.s. dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields. see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.
additionally, changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield. passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. the acquisitions of the european etf business in the third quarter of 2017 and the guggenheim etf acquisition in april 2018 increased the level of passive aum and have a dilutive impact on the company's overall net revenue yield. the company has experienced greater outflows from active aum as compared to outflows from passive aum, increasing the proportion of passive to active aum during the year ended december 31, 2018.
at december 31, 2018, passive aum were $221.0 billion, representing 24.9% of total aum at that date; whereas at december 31, 2017, passive aum were $199.0 billion, representing 21.2% of our total aum at that date (december 31, 2016: $144.4 billion 17.8%). in the year ended december 31, 2018, the net revenue yield on passive aum was 14.9 basis points compared to 16.3 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2017, a decrease of 1.4 basis points (december 31, 2016: 15.3).

*   net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus net revenues from invesco great wall, plus management and performance fees earned from cip. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by $45.7 million, equivalent to 0.9% of total operating revenues, during the year ended december 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 ($35.3 million decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016, or 0.7% of 2017 total operating revenues).
additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. as discussed in the executive overview, markets have been volatile in 2018, and returns from capital markets were mixed in the year ended december 31, 2018.

investment management fees investment management fees decreased by $44.3 million (1.1%) in the year ended december 31, 2018, to $4,082.3 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $4,126.6 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $44.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees decreased by $88.8 million (2.2%), which is comprised of a decrease in management fees due to the application of new revenue recognition guidance of $205.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, offset by an increase in management fees of $117.1 million. the $117.1 million increase in management fees resulted from increased average aum levels (9.6%), including the impact of the guggenheim acquisition, offset by changes in the product mix of aum.
investment management fees increased by $353.5 million (9.4%) in the year ended december 31, 2017, to $4,126.6 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $3,773.1 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $36.4 million (0.9%) during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $389.9 million. the increase compares to a 10.9% increase in average aum. investment management fees in 2017 also include incremental management fees from the acquisition of the european etf business.
see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31, 2018, december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 in the "assets under management" section above for additional information regarding the impact of changes in aum on management fee yields. changes in product mix of aum result in changes in the average revenue yield derived from aum due to differing fee rates and structures, which impacts our management fees.
service and distribution fees in the year ended december 31, 2018, service and distribution fees increased by $115.7 million (13.6%) to $968.5 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $852.8 million). the application of new revenue recognition guidance increased service and distribution fees by $127.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2018. the 2018 increase also reflects the inclusion of intelliflo revenues and higher administration fees. these increases were partially offset by lower transfer agency fees.
in the year ended december 31, 2017, service and distribution fees increased by $29.2 million (3.5%) to $852.8 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $823.6 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased service and distribution fees by $0.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in service and distribution fees was $28.6 million. the increase during 2017 is due to increases in distribution and redemption fees of $20.9 million and administration fees of $16.8 million, partially offset by decreases in transfer agency fees of $8.2 million and service and custodial fees of $0.9 million. the increase relates to increases in aum that earn these fees and the full year impact of fee revenue from the collegebound 529 plan which was funded in july 2016.
performance fees of our $888.2 billion in aum at december 31, 2018, approximately $46.0 billion or 5.2%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts.
in the year ended december 31, 2018, performance fees decreased by $56.4 million (49.8%) to $56.9 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $113.3 million). performance fees in 2018 included $38.7 million from real estate products, $6.5 million from private equity partnerships, $5.7 million from u.k. closed end funds and $1.2 million from bank loan products.
of our $937.6 billion in aum at december 31, 2017, approximately $48.1 billion or 5.1%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts.

revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from invesco great wall management believes that the revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from invesco great wall should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its 49% interest in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from invesco great wall. given the company's influence on the invesco great wall joint venture, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter. the company's non-gaap operating results now reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows. adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.

management, performance and other fees earned from cip management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues. as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by $3.8 million to $28.6 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 (year ended december 31, 2017: $32.4 million). the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in management fees earned from clos.

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $10.9 million (24.4%) to $33.8 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 (year ended december 31, 2017: $44.7 million). the decrease in equity in earnings is primarily driven by a decrease of $9.4 million in earnings from our real estate investments and $2.9 million from private equity investments. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million from our joint venture investments in china.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $35.4 million (380.6%) to $44.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2017 (year ended december 31, 2016: $9.3 million) primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $17.8 million related to our investment in an indian joint venture recorded in 2016. the remaining increase in equity in earnings is driven by an $8.3 million increase in earnings from our investments in real estate products and an increase of $6.0 million from our private equity investments.

interest expense interest expense increased by $16.7 million (17.6%) to $111.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 (year ended december 31, 2017: $94.8 million) primarily due to increased borrowings on the floating rate credit facility.
other gains and losses, net other gains and losses, net were a net loss of $40.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to a net gain of $49.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2017. included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended december 31, 2018 are an $18.9 million loss related to the mark-to-market on seed money investments, net trading losses of $27.6 million on the depreciation of investments and the total return swap held for our deferred compensation plans and an investment impairment charge of $3.9 million. these losses were partially offset by $6.2 million realized gains, $4.4 million of gains related to our defined benefit pension plan and $0.9 million related to a change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration liability. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, - note 14, "other gains and losses, net" for additional information.
other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $49.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to a net gain of $46.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2016. included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended december 31, 2017 are a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of euros held in the u.k. in anticipation of payment for the european etf business acquisition, net trading gains of $24.7 million on the appreciation of investments and the total return swap held for our deferred compensation plans, $14.2 million of net investment gains related to the mark-to-market on our seed money investments, $7.2 million of realized gains from equity investments, a gain of $7.6 million related to an acquisition-related change in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability, net foreign exchange gains on intercompany loans of $4.1 million and $5.8 million of other gains. these gains were partially offset by net losses during the period of $21.0 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar and euro/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rates and an investment impairment charge of $3.2 million. the 2017 period also includes a reclassification of the non-service cost components of the pension costs of $2.0 million per accounting standards update 2017-07, adopted on january 1, 2018. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, - note 14, "other gains and losses, net" for additional information.
other income/(expense) of cip in the year ended december 31, 2018, interest and dividend income of cip increased by $63.8 million (30.2%) to $275.4 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $211.6 million). interest expense of cip increased by $35.4 million (22.8%) to $190.7 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $155.3 million). the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in 2018 is primarily due to the impact of newly consolidated clos and other funds during 2018, partially offset by the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year.
in the year ended december 31, 2017, interest and dividend income of cip increased by $16.3 million (8.3%) to $211.6 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $195.3 million). interest expense of cip increased by $31.8 million (25.7%) to $155.3 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $123.5 million). the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the impact of newly consolidated clos and other funds during the year.
included in other gains/(losses) of cip, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip. in the year ended december 31, 2018, other gains and losses of cip were a net loss of $55.1 million, as compared to a net gain of $81.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2017. the net losses during 2018 were attributable to market-driven losses of investments held by consolidated funds. in the year ended december 31, 2017, other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of $81.0 million, as compared to a net gain of $7.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2016.
net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd. in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the company's holding in its consolidated clos, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2018 resulted in an net increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd. of $8.8 million (year ended december 31, 2017: $2.3 million net increase). the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd. of $3.0 million.
53
noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip. the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of non-clo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. similarly, any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos (offsetting in other gains/(losses) of cip) and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders.
additionally, cip represent less than 1% of the company's aum. therefore, the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate aum.
income before taxes total income before taxes includes income/losses of cip; however, the company's operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under u.s. gaap, as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. therefore, total u.s. and foreign income before taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 15, "taxation,", which includes income/losses from cip, and u.s. and foreign operating revenues in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 17, "geographic information.," in which cip has been eliminated, may not correlate. the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident.
total u.s. income before taxes decreased $146.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 to $491.8 million from $638.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and includes u.s. income of cip of $18.9 million (december 31, 2017: $0.1 million). u.s. income from cip increased $18.8 million from 2017 due primarily to the impact of gains on consolidated private equity partnerships and certain other consolidated funds. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2018 decreased $165.5 million (25.9%) from december 31, 2017 due to a larger decrease in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes decreased $144.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 to $646.3 million from $790.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 and includes foreign loss of cip of $9.8 million (december 31, 2017: foreign income of cip of $35.9 million). foreign income from cip decreased $45.7 million due primarily to losses on consolidated funds including the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2018. excluding cip, foreign income decreased by $98.7 million (13.1%) from 2017 due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.
total u.s. income before taxes increased $98.6 million to $638.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 from $539.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and includes u.s. income of cip of $0.1 million (december 31, 2016: $2.4 million). u.s. income of cip decreased $2.3 million (95.8%) from 2016 due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2017 increased $100.9 million (18.8%) from december 31, 2016 due to a larger increase in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes increased $124.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 to $790.7 million from $666.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 and includes foreign income of cip of $35.9 million (december 31, 2016: foreign income of cip of $14.7 million). foreign income from cip increased $21.2 million due primarily to gains on consolidated funds and the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2017. excluding cip, foreign income increased by $102.8 million (15.8%) from 2016 due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased to 22.4% (year ended december 31, 2017: 18.8%). the increase primarily reflects a $130.7 million tax benefit (9.3%) in 2017 related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states, partially offset by a 6.0% rate reduction in 2018 as a result of the lower federal tax rate effective january 1, 2018.
the inclusion of income from non-controlling interests increased our rate period-over-period by 0.5% (no change in the effective tax rate in 2018 and 0.5% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017). see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for further details and additional discussion on the amounts recorded for the 2017 tax act.
our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 decreased to 18.8% (year ended december 31, 2016: 28.0%). the decrease included a $130.7 million tax benefit (9.3%) related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the
54
2017 tax act enacted in the united states. the inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our rate period-over-period by 0.2% (0.5% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017 and 0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016). the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income.
schedule of non-gaap information we utilize the following non-gaap performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on aum), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps). the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company's ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. these measures also assist the company's management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions. the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on aum), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps. each of these measures is discussed more fully below.
the following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, diluted eps) on a u.s. gaap basis to a non-gaap basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps). these non-gaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any u.s. gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate. the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

*   operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues.
**   adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.
***   adjusted diluted eps is equal to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted shares outstanding. there is no difference between the calculated earnings per share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per share amounts under the two class method.
(1)   invesco great wall invesco great wall is one of the largest sino-foreign managers of equity products in china, with aum of $26.9 billion as of december 31, 2018. the company has a 49% interest in invesco great wall. enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business.
prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments. given the company's influence on invesco great wall, a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and aum for invesco great wall. also beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the company's non-gaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows. adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)   third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum. since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under u.s. gaap.
management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company's managed funds. further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with u.s. peer investment managers and within invesco's own investment units. additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on aum, which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period. this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company's performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes.

(3)   cip see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19 - "consolidated investment products" for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company's consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip. the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income.
management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income.

(4)   transaction, integration and restructuring related adjustments management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction, integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges. see "results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 compared to december 31, 2016 -- transaction, integration and restructuring" for additional details.
(5)    market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically managed by the company. invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial instrument. u.s. gaap requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation (depreciation) are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income. the non-gaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing u.s. gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.
57
since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period.
additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company's consolidated statements of income on the record dates. this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. the non-gaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

(d)   general and administrative expenses for 2014 and 2015 include charges of $31.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. the charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees.
(e)   included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the u.k. financial services compensation scheme.
(f)   included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar and the euro/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rates. the pound sterling contracts provide coverage through june 29, 2019 and the euro contracts provided coverage through december 27, 2017. the adjustment from u.s. gaap to non-gaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-gaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period.
(g)   employee benefit plan termination: operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related to an employee benefit plan termination.
(h)   during 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank and the purchase price was solely comprised of contingent consideration payable in future periods. adjustment represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability.
(i)   other gains and losses for 2017 includes a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of euros held in the u.k. in anticipation of payment for the european etf business acquisition.
(j)   other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the acquisition of invesco asset management (india) private limited.
(k)   the income tax provision for 2017 includes a retroactive state tax expense of $12.2 million related to 2016 and prior open tax years caused by changes in state tax regulations. 2017 also included a $130.7 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states.

unsettled fund receivables and payables unsettled fund receivables decreased by $602.5 million from $793.8 million at december 31, 2017 to $191.3 million at december 31, 2018, due primarily to the re-domicile of some of our cross-border funds and lower transaction activity between funds and investors in late december 2018 when compared to late december 2017 in our u.k. funds, offset by higher activity in uits. in our u.k. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. in the company's capacity as sponsor of uits, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and uits in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of uits. the presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ($178.7 million at december 31, 2018 down from $783.8 million at december 31, 2017) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company.
investments as of december 31, 2018 we had $613.5 million in investments (december 31, 2017: $674.6 million). included in investments are $202.8 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $78.6 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. seed investments decreased by $40.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in the period reflects cash redemptions of $59.6 million, a decrease of $101.5 million due to the consolidation of certain cip in the period eliminating the investment balances upon consolidation, as well a decrease of $18.7 million driven by market valuation changes and foreign exchange movements. these decreases were partially offset by increases due to purchases of $97.0 million and a non-cash increase of $32.7 million due to the deconsolidation of certain cip in the period (restoring the company's formerly eliminated investment balances). investments related to deferred compensation awards decreased by a net $13.7 million during the period.
included in investments are $296.3 million in equity method investments in invesco great wall and in certain of the company's private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments (december 31, 2017: $277.3 million). the increase of $19.0 million in equity method investments was driven by an increase from partnership contributions of $53.4 million and $34.0 million in current period earnings. this increase was partially offset primarily by a decrease of $52.7 million due to distributions from partnership investments and a decrease of $7.6 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates. also included in investments are foreign time deposits of $28.1 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the december 31, 2017 balance of $28.6 million.
assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables one of our subsidiaries, invesco perpetual life limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the u.k. the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. the decrease in the balance of these accounts from $12,444.5 million at december 31, 2017, to $11,384.8 million at december 31, 2018,was the result of negative foreign exchange rate movements of $717.6 million and negative market movements of $718.6 million, partially offset by net business inflows of $376.5 million .
intangible assets, net intangible assets reflect a net increase of $617.4 million from $1,558.7 million at december 31, 2017, to $2,176.1 million at december 31, 2018. the increase includes $663.8 million related to the preliminary purchase price allocation to intangible assets from the guggenheim investments' etf and intelliflo acquisitions in 2018, offset by amortization of $29.7 million and decreases in foreign exchange movements of $16.7 million.
goodwill goodwill increased from $6,590.7 million at december 31, 2017, to $7,157.1 million at december 31, 2018. the increase includes $819.2 million related to the preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill from the guggenheim investments' etf and intelliflo acquisitions in 2018 offset by a decrease in foreign exchange movements of $252.8 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 6, "goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. the company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year. as a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. see "critical accounting policies - goodwill" for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process.

long-term debt long-term debt increased from $2,075.8 million at december 31, 2017, to $2,408.8 million at december 31, 2018, an increase of $333.0 million. as of december 31, 2018, there was $330.8 million outstanding on the credit facility (at december 31, 2017: zero).
liquidity and capital resources our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include:
2018: on october 17, 2018, the company entered into a definitive agreement, whereby invesco will acquire massmutual's asset management affiliate, oppenheimerfunds, inc. in turn, massmutual and the oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders will receive a combination of common and preferred equity consideration, and massmutual will become a significant shareholder in invesco, with an approximate 17% stake expected at closing. under the terms of the agreement, invesco will acquire oppenheimerfunds with consideration to massmutual and oppenheimerfunds employees consisting of 81.9 million shares of invesco common equity and $4 billion in perpetual, non-cumulative preferred shares with a 21-year non-call period and a fixed rate of 5.9%. the shareholder agreement specifies a lock-up period of two years for the common stock and five years for the preferred stock. the preferred stock will not be convertible into any other class of capital stock or debt of invesco.
the preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a non-cumulative basis when, if and as declared by the board of directors of invesco. however, if invesco has not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period, it may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, its common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period. shares of preferred stock can not be redeemed prior to the 21st anniversary of their original issue date, and are redeemable at the option of invesco thereafter. the preferred stock has no put feature to accelerate redemption.
on october 18, 2018, the company announced a common stock buyback program of $1.2 billion to be completed within the next two years, which will be financed through the strong operating cash flows of the combined invesco and oppenheimerfunds organization. for the purpose of repurchasing its shares, the company entered into a forward contract during the fourth quarter of 2018. under this contract, the counterparty purchased $300 million (14.4 million shares) of the company's shares in the fourth quarter. the shares are included as treasury shares in the company's balance sheet and reduced outstanding shares as of december 3, 2018. the company intends to repurchase an additional $100-$300 million prior to the closing of the oppenheimerfunds acquisition (depending on market conditions), with the remainder to be purchased by the end of 2020.
on april 6, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments' etf business for a purchase price of $1.2 billion. to fund the purchase, the company borrowed approximately $835 million on its credit facility in early april 2018. in addition, the company also borrowed on the credit facility to fund part of the intelliflo acquisition. as of december 31, 2018, the remaining balance on the credit facility was $330.8 million.
2017: during 2017, the company amended and restated the existing credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing limit to $1.5 billion and extending the expiration date to august 11, 2022.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax act, was signed into law. the 2017 tax act, among other items, reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018.
2016: during 2016, we repurchased 18.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $535.0 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program.
our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include:
•   reinvestment in the business;
•   moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "dividends" section below);
•   share repurchase; and
•   target an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of european regulatory and liquidity requirements.
63
these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. as of the filing of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a2/stable, bbb+/stable and a-/positive from moody's, s&p, and fitch ratings fitch, respectively. our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. see also item 1a - "risk factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings.
certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive and the u.k.'s internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. as of december 31, 2018, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $720.2 million (december 31, 2017: $761.4 million); the decrease was primarily driven by the weakening of the pound sterling against the u.s. dollar. the total amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents was $996.7 million at december 31, 2018 (december 31, 2017: $1,595.6 million). in october 2018, upon completion of redomicile of certain funds, regulatory credit risk volatility has been reduced, which allowed the company to return capital to the parent.
the consolidation of $6,982.0 million and $5,226.0 million of total assets and long-term debt of cip as of december 31, 2018, respectively, did not impact the company's liquidity and capital resources. the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, if the clos were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "consolidated investment products," for additional details.
cash flow discussion the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products.

(1)   these tables include non-gaap presentations. cash held by cip is not available for use by invesco. additionally, there is no recourse to invesco for cip debt. the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions. policyholder assets and liabilities are equal and offsetting and have no impact on invesco's shareholder's equity. the impact of cash inflows/outflows from policyholder assets and liabilities are reflected within cash flows from operating activities as changes in receivable and/or payables, as applicable.
operating activities operating cash flows include the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum, offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments which are paid out during the first quarter, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by cip, and investment activities, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income.
during 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $828.8 million compared to $1,157.8 million provided during 2017 (a decrease of $329.0 million). as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip to cash used in operating activities was $234.2 million of cash used during 2018 compared to $294.2 million of cash used during 2017. excluding the impact of cip, cash provided by operations was $1,063.0 million during 2018 compared to $1,452.0 million of cash provided by operations during 2017. this decrease includes a $74.2 million decrease in operating income and a $287.7 million decrease in net purchases/sales of investments. cash provided by operations in the 2017 period included $143.5 million of dispositions of investments, including seed money and deferred compensation investments sold in connection with the entry into the total return swap.
during 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased $503.8 million to $1,157.8 million from $654.0 million in 2016. as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip to cash used by operating activities was $294.2 million of cash used during 2017 compared to $210.2 million of cash used during 2016. excluding the impact of cip, cash provided by operations was $1,452.0 million in 2017 compared to $864.2 million in 2016, an increase of $587.8 million. this increase is larger than the $126.7 million increase in operating income principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. excluding the impact of cip, the changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $154.5 million of cash in 2017, as compared to utilizing $243.2 million in the same period in 2016, increasing cash provided by operating activities by $397.7 million when comparing the two periods. this includes a $59.6 million reduction in payments for annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vestings, annual retirement plan contributions, and a $304.2 million decrease in net purchases of available-for-sale investments. the increases
65
in receivables and payables, excluding the impact of cip, of $3,393.4 million and $3,404.4 million, respectively, include increases in our assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables, as discussed in item 7, management's discussion and analysis -- balance sheet discussion -- "assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables" of $3,260.6 million each. excluding cip, there were no significant non-cash items that impacted the comparison between the periods of operating income to net cash provided by operations.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,898.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 (2017: net cash used of $974.4 million). as shown in the tables above, the impact of cip on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $1,248.0 million used (2017: $678.3 million used). excluding the impact of cip cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $1,650.7 million (2017: net cash used of $296.1 million).

during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company had capital expenditures of $102.5 million (2017: $111.7 million). our capital expenditures related principally in each period to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. also, in each period, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. these projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows.

dividends invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. the 2018 quarterly dividend was 30.0 cents per invesco ltd. common share. on january 31, 2019, the company declared a fourth quarter 2018 cash dividend, which will be paid on march 1, 2019, to shareholders of record as of february 14, 2019 with an ex-dividend date of february 13, 2019. the total dividend attributable to the 2018 fiscal year of 1.20 per share represented a 3.4% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2017 fiscal year of 1.16 per share.
the declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. the board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts.
share repurchase plan during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company entered into a forward contract to repurchase $300 million of shares as part of its announced $1.2 billion common stock buyback program. under this contract, the counterparty purchased 14.4 million shares during the fourth quarter which are included as treasury shares in the company's balance sheet and reduced outstanding shares as of december 3, 2018.

(1)   adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures.
(2)   ebitda and adjusted debt are non-gaap financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. the calculation of ebitda above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to invesco ltd.) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to invesco ltd. is the most appropriate gaap measure from which to reconcile to ebitda. the calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $2,408.8 million plus $10.4 million in letters of credit.
the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. the item 1. business -- risk management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management.
credit and liquidity risk capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"), through measurement and analysis. the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. as of december 31, 2018, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,147.7 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "related parties," for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.
the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $2,408.8 million in total debt. the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.

effects of inflation inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. first, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum.
off balance sheet commitments see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 18, "commitments and contingencies - off balance sheet commitments," for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments.
contractual obligations we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31, 2018:

(1)   long-term debt includes $2,078.0 million of fixed rate debt. fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. the table above includes the company's debt; debt of cip is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "consolidated investment products," for additional information.
(2)   operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, "operating leases" for sublease information.
(3)   in the ordinary course of business, invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of invesco. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2018, the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. in addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on aum levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements when services are provided. purchase obligations also include contingent consideration liabilities.
in october 2018, the company entered into a forward contract to purchase $300 million of its common shares and settlement of the purchase will occur by the third quarter of 2019. at december 31, 2018 the payable was $297.1 million and is included in other liabilities. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 7, "other liabilities" for additional details.
(4)   the company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. at december 31, 2018, the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $391.6 million. these are not included in the above table. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 18, "commitments and contingencies" for additional details.

(5)   due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2018, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $20.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 15 - "taxation" for a discussion regarding income taxes.
(6)   in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension plans. for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 we contributed $21.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively, to these plans. in 2019, we expect to contribute $23.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 12, "retirement benefit plans" for detailed benefit pension plan information. the company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies." the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future.
taxation we operate in several countries, states and other local/regional taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all our locations. annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled.
deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. in the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors.
the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. if it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense.
the company recognized a provisional income tax benefit of $130.7 million as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31, 2017 related to the 2017 tax act.  in 2018, the company filed its 2017 tax return and adjusted the provisional estimate for the re-measurement of deferred taxes by $13.1 million. see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for further details and additional discussion on the amounts recorded for the 2017 tax act.

goodwill our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2018 and 2017 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $7,157.1 million and $6,590.7 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's aum, or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees.
the october 1, 2018 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2017 annual impairment test. fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. market gains are based upon historical returns of the s&p 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's aum mix on the testing date. the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. the discount rate remained fairly consistent for the october 1, 2018 analysis compared to the october 1, 2017 as there were no significant changes in these assumptions from 2017.
the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period. while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments.
intangible assets where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). in addition, management's judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $29.7 million, $17.4 million and $13.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. in 2018 and 2017, annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required.

cip assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (vie) or voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. a vie, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund.
determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the fund's economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the consolidated statements of income.
as of december 31, 2018, the company consolidated cip that held investments of $6,213.5 million (december 31, 2017: $5,658.0 million).
contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.

united kingdom exit from european union following the june 2016 vote to exit the eu, the united kingdom ("uk") served notice under article 50 of the treaty on european union on march 29, 2017 to initiate the two-year long process of exiting from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit". there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the uk will ultimately exit the eu. as a result, the uk's relationship with the eu, as well as whether an agreement will be reached by the march 29, 2019 exit deadline, remains unclear. moreover, the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic, political and regulatory instability. blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu, and engaging in client communications. these steps, many of which have been time-consuming and costly, are expected to add complexity to blackrock's european operations. in addition, depending on the terms of the uk's exit from the eu, blackrock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations post-brexit, which may impede the company's growth or impact its financial performance.
acquisitions in august 2018, the company completed the acquisition of tennenbaum capital partners, llc ("tcp transaction"), a leading manager focused on middle market performing credit and special situation credit opportunities. the company believes the acquisition will enhance its

ability to provide clients with private credit solutions across a range of risk level, liquidity and geography. total cash consideration paid at closing was approximately $393 million.
in september 2018, the company completed the acquisition of the asset management business of citibanamex, a subsidiary of citigroup inc. ("citibanamex transaction"). the company acquired aum across local fixed income, equity and multi-asset products, enabling the company to offer a full range of local and international investment solutions for clients in mexico. total consideration at closing was approximately $360 million, including estimated contingent consideration.
divestitures in august 2018, the company completed the sale of its minority interest in dsp blackrock investment managers pvt. ltd. to the dsp group ("dsp transaction"). the company had a 40% stake in the joint venture, which managed and marketed a range of co-branded mutual funds in india. the company recorded a $40 million pre-tax nonoperating gain in connection with the dsp transaction.
in july 2018, the company completed the part vii transfer of the underlying assets and liabilities of its uk defined contribution administration and platform business to aegon n.v. ("aegon transaction"). the company continues to be the primary investment manager for the clients who transferred to aegon in connection with the transaction. this transaction was not material to the company's consolidated statements of financial condition or results of operations.
business outlook blackrock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. blackrock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning blackrock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management.
blackrock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients, could impact blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings.
blackrock manages $3.0 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. significant global equity market declines in the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced blackrock's aum by approximately $466 billion over that period, negatively impacted blackrock's base fee run-rate entering 2019. in addition, challenged market performance in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions in 2018 may also impact performance fees for 2019, as certain quarterly- and annual-locking funds are below high-water marks entering the year.
blackrock's highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. blackrock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. in addition, blackrock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in ishares etfs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. the diversity of blackrock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives, which are two areas of focus for blackrock.
the index investing industry has been growing rapidly - with etfs as a major beneficiary - driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, clients' focus on value for money, the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of all-to-all networked trading. ishares etfs growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including core, financial instruments and precision exposures, and fixed income, smart beta & sustainable etfs.
as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, blackrock's retail strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions. this includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock's retail strategy, as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by aladdin.
institutional client behavior was impacted by global market uncertainty in 2018, with many choosing to de-risk from equities. blackrock's institutional results will be driven by enhancing blackrock's solutions-oriented approach; deepening client relationships through product diversification and higher value-add capabilities, including illiquid alternatives; and leveraging aladdin's analytical and risk management expertise.
blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions.

2018 compared with 2017
gaap.  operating income of $5,457 million increased $203 million from 2017. operating income growth primarily reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees, higher compensation and benefits, higher general and administration expense, and higher volume-related expense. operating income for 2018 also included a restructuring charge of $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 from an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ("nci"), decreased $44 million from 2017 driven by lower net gains on investments, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income during 2018. nonoperating results for 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the dsp transaction and a $10 million noncash pre-tax gain related to the revaluation of another strategic investment.
income tax expense for 2018 reflected a reduced tax rate associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 tax act") and included $145 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the company's organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2018. income tax expense for 2017 included $1.2 billion of net tax benefit related to the 2017 tax act and $173 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards. see income tax expense within discussion of financial results for more information.
diluted earnings per common share decreased $3.54, or 12%, compared with 2017, reflecting a lower tax rate in 2017 due to the net tax benefit from the 2017 tax act and lower nonoperating income in 2018, partially offset by higher operating income in 2018 and the benefit of share repurchases.
as adjusted.  operating income of $5,531 million increased $262 million and operating margin of 44.3% increased 20 bps from 2017. the pre-tax restructuring charge of $60 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results. on an as adjusted basis, income tax expense for 2017 excludes the previously described $1.2 billion of net noncash tax benefit related to the 2017 tax act and income tax expense for 2018 and 2017 excludes a $3 million net noncash benefit and a $16 million net noncash expense, respectively, associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. diluted earnings per common share increased $4.44, or 20%, from 2017, reflecting higher operating income, the impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2018 and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by lower nonoperating income in 2018.
2017 compared with 2016
gaap.  operating income of $5,254 million increased $689 million and operating margin of 38.6% increased 140 bps from 2016. operating income and operating margin growth primarily reflected higher base fees, performance fees, and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense. operating income for 2017 also included approximately $22 million of expense associated with the strategic repositioning of the active equity platform. operating income for 2016 included a restructuring charge of $76 million in connection with a project to streamline and simplify the organization. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, increased $76 million from 2016 driven by higher net gains on investments.
35
income tax expense for 2017 included the previously mentioned $1.2 billion net tax benefit related to the 2017 tax act, $173 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards, including a $151 million discrete tax benefit reflecting the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance, and the previously described noncash tax expense of $16 million. income tax expense for 2016 included a $30 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom, and state and local income tax changes. income tax expense for 2016 also included nonrecurring tax benefits of $65 million. see income tax expense within discussion of financial results for more information.
diluted earnings per common share increased $11.10, or 58%, compared with 2016, reflecting the net tax benefit from the 2017 tax act, higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases.
as adjusted.  operating income of $5,269 million increased $600 million and operating margin of 44.1% increased 30 bps from 2016. the pre-tax restructuring charge of $76 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2016. on as adjusted basis, income tax expense for 2017 excludes $1,758 million noncash tax benefit and $477 million deemed repatriation tax expense related to the 2017 tax act, and the previously described noncash expense of $16 million and income tax expense for 2016 excludes the previously mentioned net noncash benefit of $30 million. diluted earnings per common share increased $3.22, or 17%, from 2016.

for further discussion of blackrock's revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see discussion of financial results herein.
non-gaap financial measures blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"); however, management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-gaap financial measures. management reviews non-gaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating blackrock's financial performance over time. management also uses non-gaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. non-gaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock's revenue and expense. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock's financial performance. adjustments to gaap financial measures ("non-gaap adjustments") include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of blackrock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.

•   operating income, as adjusted, includes non-gaap expense adjustments. in 2018 and 2016, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of blackrock's ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("ltip") funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock's book value.

•   operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably, and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock's results until future periods.

36
revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties. management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the company's products. blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.

(1)   results for 2017 and 2016 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. for further information, refer to note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8.

management believes net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of blackrock's profitability and financial performance. net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to blackrock, inc., gaap basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and restructuring charge.
for each period presented, the non-gaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. the 2017 noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. a deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the 2017 as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
per share amounts reflect net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

(1)   amounts included net aum impact from the tcp transaction, the citibanamex transaction, the aegon transaction and the dsp transaction.

(2)   foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-us dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes.

(3)   average aum is calculated as the average of the month-end spot aum amounts for the trailing thirteen months.

(4)   advisory aum represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments.

(5)   amounts include commodity ishares etfs.

aum decreased $312.4 billion to $5.98 trillion at december 31, 2018 from $6.29 trillion at december 31, 2017 driven by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive long-term net inflows, led by ishares etfs, active multi-asset and illiquid alternatives, and net aum added from strategic transactions.
net market depreciation of $384.1 billion was driven by lower global equity markets.
aum decreased $79.4 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar, largely against the british pound and the euro.

aum increased $1.1 trillion to $6.29 trillion at december 31, 2017 from $5.15 trillion at december 31, 2016 driven by net market appreciation, positive net inflows, the impact of foreign exchange movements and aum acquired in the first reserve transaction.
net market appreciation of $628.9 billion was primarily driven by higher us and global equity markets.
aum increased $140.9 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound.

discussion of financial results introduction the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-us dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes.
the company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.
investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on aum. investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. as such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the company's revenue and earnings. the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31.
the company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. fees earned for technology services are recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis.
the company records distribution and servicing costs for distributing the company's products and for providing other support services to investment portfolios. the costs are based on net asset values and are recognized when the amount of costs is known.
the company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.
the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
the company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments.
operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
•   employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.

•   distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily aum driven, include payments made to third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain company products.

•   direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by the company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. these expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in aum, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.

•   general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $16 million, $5 million and $(6) million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

approximately 75% of the company's revenue is generated in us dollars. the company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states.
nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. the company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including federal reserve bank stock. the company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
in addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. the portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the company is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income.

2018 compared with 2017
gaap. expense increased $395 million, or 5%, from 2017, driven primarily by higher general and administration expense, higher volume-related expense, a restructuring charge recorded in 2018, and higher employee compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased $67 million, or 2%, to $4,320 million in 2018 from $4,253 million in 2017, primarily reflecting higher headcount and higher operating income, partially offset by lower incentive compensation primarily driven by lower performance fees. employees at december 31, 2018 totaled approximately 14,900 compared with approximately 13,900 at december 31, 2017.
direct fund expense increased $103 million from 2017, reflecting higher ishares etfs average aum.
general and administration expense increased $192 million from 2018, reflecting higher technology expense, higher marketing and promotional expense and higher portfolio services expense. the increase included the impact of contingent consideration fair value adjustments, higher professional fees (associated with strategic transactions, tax reform and brexit), product launch costs and foreign exchange remeasurement expense.
restructuring expense of $60 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2018 in connection with an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce.
amortization of intangible assets expense decreased $39 million, or 44%, to $50 million in 2018, primarily reflecting certain finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
as adjusted. expense, as adjusted, increased $336 million, or 4%, to $8,667 million in 2018 from $8,331 million in 2017. the increase in total expense, as adjusted, is driven primarily by higher general and administration expense, higher volume-related expense, and higher employee compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets. the restructuring charge recorded in 2018 has been excluded from the as adjusted results.

2017 compared with 2016
gaap. expense increased $650 million, or 8%, from 2016, driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense, partially offset by a restructuring charge recorded in 2016.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased $375 million, or 10%, to $4,253 million in 2017 from $3,878 million in 2016, reflecting higher incentive compensation, higher headcount, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the active equity platform. employees at december 31, 2017 totaled approximately 13,900 compared with approximately 13,000 at december 31, 2016.
distribution and servicing costs totaled $1,663 million in 2017 compared with $1,608 million in 2016 reflecting higher average aum and the effect of aum acquired in the bofa global capital management transaction.
direct fund expense increased $138 million from 2016, reflecting higher ishares etfs average aum.
general and administration expense increased $168 million from 2016, reflecting higher portfolio services, professional services fees (associated with strategic transactions, mifid implementation, and tax reform), technology expense, operating errors, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement expense.
as adjusted. expense, as adjusted, increased $739 million, or 10%, to $8,331 million in 2017 from $7,592 million in 2016. the increase in total expense, as adjusted, is driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefit expense, higher volume-related expense and higher general and administration expense. the restructuring charge recorded in 2016 has been excluded from the as adjusted results.

(4)   gaap income tax expense and effective tax rate for 2017 reflects a $1.2 billion net tax benefit related to the 2017 tax act.

the company's tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. the significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the us federal statutory rate of 21% include the united kingdom, germany, canada and switzerland.
2018 income tax expense (gaap) reflected:
o   a reduced tax rate associated with the 2017 tax act;

o   $81 million discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the company's organization entity structure; and

o   a $64 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2018.

2017 income tax expense (gaap) reflected:
o   the following amounts related to the 2017 tax act:

o   $106 million tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets;

o   $1,758 million noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and

o   $477 million tax expense related to the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits.

o   a noncash expense of $16 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes; and

o   $173 million discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards, including $151 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation awards. see note 2, significant accounting policies, for further information.

the as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.4% for 2017 excluded the noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and noncash expense of $16 million mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. in addition, the deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
2016 income tax expense (gaap) reflected:
o   a net noncash benefit of $30 million, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities; and

o   a benefit from $65 million of nonrecurring items, including the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters.

the as adjusted effective tax rate of 29.6% for 2016 excluded the net noncash benefit of $30 million mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
balance sheet overview as adjusted balance sheet the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
the company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-gaap financial measures, as an economic presentation of the company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
48
separate account assets and liabilities and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements separate account assets are maintained by blackrock life limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that is a registered life insurance company in the united kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. the company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. the separate account assets are not available to creditors of the company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the company's assets. the net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. while blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
in addition, the company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under blackrock life limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. the collateral is not available to creditors of the company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the company's assets.
consolidated sponsored investment products the company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as voting rights entities ("vres") and vies, (collectively, "consolidated sponsored investment products"). see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on the company's consolidation policy.
the company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. in addition, the company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the company's operations.

the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a gaap basis. please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. the discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on blackrock's stockholders' equity.
assets. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018 and 2017 included $59 million and $63 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated vres (see liquidity and capital resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2018).

accounts receivable at december 31, 2018 decreased $42 million from december 31, 2017. investments were $1,796 million at december 31, 2018 (for more information see investments herein). goodwill and intangible assets increased $756 million from december 31, 2017, primarily due to the tcp and citibanamex transactions, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. other assets (including property and equipment) increased $543 million from december 31, 2017, primarily related to an increase in certain strategic investments, deferred tax assets and current taxes receivable.
liabilities. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2018 decreased $165 million from december 31, 2017, primarily due to lower 2018 incentive compensation accruals. accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december 31, 2018 increased $131 million from december 31, 2017 primarily due to higher current income taxes payables and increased accruals. other liabilities increased $263 million from december 31, 2017, primarily related to an increase in uncertain tax positions and contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions.
investments and investments of consolidated vies the company's investments and investments of consolidated vies (collectively, "total investments") were $1,796 million and $2,680 million, respectively, at december 31, 2018. total investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as vres and vies. management reviews blackrock's total investments on an "economic" basis, which eliminates the portion of total investments that does not impact blackrock's book value or net income attributable to blackrock. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of total investments that is owned by the company, net of nci, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to blackrock.
the company further presents net "economic" investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. the economic impact of total investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. the impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to blackrock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. finally, the company's regulatory investment in federal reserve bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the company's net economic investment exposure.

short-term borrowings
2018 revolving credit facility. the company's credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in april 2018 to extend the maturity date to march 2023 (the "2018 credit facility"). the 2018 credit facility permits the company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2018 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable london interbank offered rate plus a spread. the 2018 credit facility requires the company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at december 31, 2018. the 2018 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. at december 31, 2018, the company had no amount outstanding under the 2018 credit facility.
commercial paper program.  the company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "cp notes") on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. the commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2018 credit facility. at december 31, 2018, blackrock had no cp notes outstanding.

contingent obligations(3)
(1)   the amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 notes (issued in euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the eur/usd foreign exchange rate as of december 31, 2018.

(2)   the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2018. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2018 totaled $287 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

(3)   at december 31, 2018, the company had approximately $546 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.

operating leases. the company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. in connection with certain lease agreements, the company is responsible for escalation payments. the contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. these leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are currently not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
in may 2017, the company entered into an agreement with 50 hymc owner llc, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 hudson yards, new york, new york. the term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in may 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term). this lease is classified as an operating lease and, as such, is currently not recorded as a liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
purchase obligations. in the ordinary course of business, blackrock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2018, the company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2018.
investment commitments. at december 31, 2018, the company had $352 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated vies. these products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. this amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. these unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. these commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the company that are not yet legally binding. the company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
contingent payments related to business acquisitions. in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2018 totaled $287 million, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
the following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table:
carried interest clawback. as a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. the company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments, or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated vies on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock's consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
indemnifications. in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2018. see further discussion in note 14, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
53
on behalf of certain clients, the company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. in connection with securities lending transactions, blackrock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. the amount of securities on loan as of december 31, 2018 and subject to this type of indemnification was $201 billion. in the company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $214 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2018. the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31, 2018.
while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification, blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
compensation and benefit obligations. the company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2018 totaled $1,988 million and included incentive compensation of $1,424 million, deferred compensation of $310 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $254 million. substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2019, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to three years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this filing, including information regarding the adoption of asu 2014-09.
consolidation in the normal course of business, the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre. assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis. factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. see note 5, consolidated voting rights entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information. investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary ("pb") of the entity.
at december 31, 2018, blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment products that were determined to be vies, which required blackrock to consolidate them. blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie. the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10%. see note 6, variable interest entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
investments equity method investments. for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee, and where it is not the pb of a vie, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the company follows the equity method of accounting. the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of blackrock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity.
blackrock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. therefore, under the equity method of accounting, blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock's core business.
at december 31, 2018, the company had $781 million and $459 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at december 31, 2017, the company had $816 million and $468 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively.
54
other nonequity method minority strategic investments.  other nonequity method minority strategic investments are recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  at december 31, 2018 and 2017, these investments totaled $199 million and $45 million, respectively, and included investments in equity securities, which are generally measured at fair value or under the measurement alternative to fair value for nonmarketable securities. changes in value of these securities are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
impairments of investments. evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
fair value measurements the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.
changes in valuation. changes in value on $4,476 million of total investments will impact the company's nonoperating income (expense), $280 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $387 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). at december 31, 2018, changes in fair value of $2,835 million of consolidated vies/vres will impact blackrock's net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. blackrock's net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated vies/vres was $1,740 million.
goodwill and intangible assets the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. in addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. finite-lived management contracts and investor/customer relationships, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at december 31, 2018, ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 6.5 years.
goodwill. the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company. the impairment assessment performed as of july 31, 2018 indicated no impairment charge was required. the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. at december 31, 2018, the company's common stock closed at $392.82, which exceeded its book value of approximately $204.23 per share.
indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum, revenue basis points, projected aum growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. in addition, the company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
for finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $50 million, $89 million and $99 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, the company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. the company continuously monitors various factors, including aum, for potential indicators of impairment.

contingent consideration liabilities in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets. the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently change, the contingent consideration liability is adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income. cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess (if any) cash payments classified in operating activities. any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities.
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company's current estimates. at december 31, 2018, blackrock had $795 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $462 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2018, the company had deferred income tax assets of $163 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,571 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company.
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. the assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $282 million and current income taxes payables of $341 million at december 31, 2018.

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated. management judgment may be also required when determining the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. many of blackrock's promised services represent a series of distinct services (e.g., investment advisory services) in which the associated variable consideration (e.g., management fees) is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term.
investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. in general, reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value).
the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. for 2018, 2017 and 2016, securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled $627 million, $597 million and $579 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
the company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.

performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund's investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. significant judgement is involved in making such determination. performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. consequently, a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. at each reporting date, the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. these factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company's influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. the company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. therefore, carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments/investments of consolidated vies or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.
the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the company had $293 million and $219 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition. a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. see note 15, revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2018 and 2017.
fees earned for technology services are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis.
adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
distribution and service fees represent fees earned for distributing investment products and for providing other support services to investment portfolios, are based on net asset values, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
accounting developments for accounting pronouncements that the company adopted during the year ended december 31, 2018 and for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.

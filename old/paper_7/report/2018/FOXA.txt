overview of the company's business the company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following four segments:
•   cable network programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed primarily through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunication companies and online video distributors, (collectively, "multi-channel video programming distributors") ("mvpds") in the united states ("u.s.") and internationally.

•   television, which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the u.s. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the u.s. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with fox broadcasting company ("fox"), nine are affiliated with master distribution service, inc. ("mynetworktv"), one is affiliated with both the cw television network and mynetworktv and one is an independent station).

•   filmed entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide.

•   other, corporate and eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead costs and intercompany eliminations.

cable network programming and television the company's cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from mvpds based on the number of their subscribers. affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to u.s. mvpds to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. in the u.s., cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators are currently the predominant means of distribution of the company's program services. internationally, distribution technology varies region by region.
the television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising and affiliate fee revenue. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues.
u.s. law governing retransmission consent revenue, recognized as affiliate fees, provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from mvpds who carry the company's broadcast signals. retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-based compensatory fees paid to the company by mvpds that distribute the signals of the company's owned and operated television stations. the company also receives compensation, primarily related to the distribution of fox programming, from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with fox.
the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment and the television segment are acquisition and production expenses related to programming, marketing and promotional expenses, and expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network or broadcaster. marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
the profitability of u.s. national sports contracts and certain international sports rights agreements is based on the company's best estimates at june 30, 2018 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. should revenues decline materially from estimates applied at june 30, 2018, amortization of rights may be accelerated. should revenues improve as
45
compared to estimated revenues, the company may have improved results related to the contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term.
filmed entertainment the filmed entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-action and animated motion pictures and television series. in general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the company are exhibited in u.s. and foreign theaters, followed by home entertainment, including sale and rental of dvds and blu-rays, licensing through digital distribution platforms, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently made available via digital distribution platforms and released in seasonal dvd and blu-ray box sets. more successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. the length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. license fees received for television exhibition (including international and u.s. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results.
the revenues and operating results of the filmed entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the company's theatrical, home entertainment and digital distribution releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. the distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, rental kiosks and digital distribution platforms), have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. a further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment.
the company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its theatrical and television productions. these arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. the parties to these arrangements, primarily for theatrical productions, include studio and non-studio entities both domestic and international. in several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. the filmed entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. the substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party investors' contractual interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 926, "entertainment-films" ("asc 926"), the estimate of the third-party investor's interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues.
operating costs incurred by the filmed entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
other business developments in june 2018, the company entered into an amended and restated merger agreement and plan of merger (the "amended and restated merger agreement") with the walt disney company ("disney"), which amends and restates in its entirety the agreement and plan of merger that the company entered into with disney in december 2017. prior to the mergers contemplated by the amended and restated
46
merger agreement, the company will transfer a portfolio of the company's news, sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities into a newly formed subsidiary ("new fox") and the holders of the outstanding shares of the company's class a common stock and class b common stock (other than holders that are subsidiaries of the company) will receive, on a pro rata basis, all of the issued and outstanding common stock of new fox.
in december 2016, the company made an offer to purchase the fully diluted share capital of sky plc ("sky") which the company does not already own. in july 2018, the company announced an increased offer price for the sky acquisition (the "increased offer"). on august 7, 2018, the company posted an offer document to sky shareholders in connection with the increased offer and announced that it intends to implement the sky acquisition by way of a takeover offer within the meaning of part 28 of the companies act 2006 (the "uk companies act") rather than by means of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with part 26 of the uk companies act, which had been the proposed structure of the sky acquisition prior to that date. the company has noted that the deadline for publication of any revised offer document in respect of its increased offer is september 22, 2018.

overview - the company's revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and content revenues partially offset by lower advertising revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to contractual rate increases at the cable network programming and television segments. the increase in content revenue was primarily due to higher subscription video-on-demand ("svod") revenue from the licensing of television productions, higher worldwide theatrical revenue and the sublicensing of big ten programming rights to third party networks. the decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of the national football league ("nfl") super bowl li in february 2017 and lower u.s. political advertising revenue due to the impact of the 2016 presidential election last year partially offset by the broadcasts of the indian premier league ("ipl") and the fédération internationale de football association ("fifa") world cup. these revenue increases include a benefit of approximately $135 million due to the strengthening of local currencies against the u.s. dollar for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.
operating expenses increased 9% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher sports and entertainment programming rights amortization at the cable network programming segment and higher production amortization and participation costs from television and motion picture productions at the filmed entertainment segment.
48
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher compensation expenses, including approximately $65 million of additional compensation expense related to the transaction (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "disney transaction/distribution of new fox"), and higher legal fees.
impairment and restructuring charges - see note 5 - restructuring programs and note 6 - inventories, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
equity losses of affiliates - equity losses of affiliates increased $97 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher losses at hulu, llc ("hulu") resulting from higher programming costs partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenues. partially offsetting the increased hulu equity losses were higher earnings at sky, principally as a result of increased revenues partially offset by higher programming and operating costs, and improved results at endemol shine group, primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal 2017.

interest expense, net - interest expense increased $29 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the bridge credit agreement and the bridge commitment letter related to the sky acquisition and the transaction, respectively (as described in note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the headings "sky acquisition" and "disney transaction/distribution of new fox").
other, net - see note 22 - additional financial information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "other, net".
income tax benefit (expense) - the company's effective tax rate of (8)% for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 28% primarily due to a provisional $1.5 billion tax benefit which reflects the effects of the legislation in the u.s. passed in december 2017 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") (see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "u.s. tax reform").
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% benefit from domestic production activities and a 2% benefit from the company's foreign operations.
net income - net income increased for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the income tax benefit as a result of the tax act.

overview - the company's revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues partially offset by lower content revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber at the domestic channels. the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of super bowl li in february 2017, higher ratings and pricing at fox news channel ("fox news") and the broadcast of the major league baseball ("mlb") world series, which benefited from higher ratings and two additional games. partially offsetting these increases in advertising revenue were lower entertainment advertising revenue at both fox and the company's television stations due to lower entertainment ratings at fox as compared to fiscal 2016, which included the final season of american idol. the increase in other revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of the publishing, travel and certain other businesses (the "ngs media business") in november 2015 from the national geographic society (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "national geographic partners"). the decrease in content revenue was primarily attributable to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues from motion pictures partially offset by higher svod and network and syndication revenues. the 4% revenue increase is net of a decrease of approximately $220 million due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
50
operating expenses increased 4% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization at the cable network programming and television segments, including super bowl li at the television segment, and the acquisition of the ngs media business partially offset by lower marketing costs at the filmed entertainment segment.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower compensation expense partially offset by the acquisition of the ngs media business.
impairment and restructuring charges - see note 5 - restructuring programs and note 6 - inventories, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
equity losses of affiliates - equity losses of affiliates increased $7 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher losses at hulu and lower equity earnings for sky principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling partially offset by improved results at endemol shine group. for fiscal 2016, endemol shine group's results include the company's proportionate share related to the loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary and other impairment charges of approximately $95 million (see note 7 - investments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "other equity affiliates").

interest expense, net - interest expense increased $35 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the bridge credit agreement (as described in note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "sky acquisition") and higher average debt outstanding as a result of the issuance in november 2016 of $450 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2026 and $400 million of 4.750% senior notes due 2046.

income tax expense - the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% benefit from domestic production activities and a 2% benefit from the company's foreign operations.
the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2016 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% rate reduction from the company's foreign operations and a 4% rate reduction from increased tax amortization deductions for certain film and television properties as a result of a ruling that was received by the company. in addition, increases in the net provision for uncertain tax positions were substantially offset by the final settlement of a foreign matter.
net income - net income increased for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher operating results.

segment analysis the company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. the company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment oibda. due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.
segment oibda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment oibda does not include: amortization of cable distribution investments, depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest expense, net, interest income, other, net, income tax benefit (expense), loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. management believes that segment oibda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the company's businesses.
management believes that information about total segment oibda assists all users of the company's consolidated financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. total segment oibda provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including segment oibda and total segment oibda, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment oibda may be considered a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance.

for fiscal 2018, television segment oibda decreased $532 million, or 60%, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above as well as increased expenses of $45 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2017. operating expenses remained relatively consistent with fiscal 2017, as the decreased expenses due to absence of super bowl li were offset by higher sports programming rights amortization primarily due to the broadcast of a higher number of college football games, the addition of the fifa world cup and contractual rate increases with the nfl and mlb. selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation, legal and facility costs. the absence of super bowl li in the current year decreased segment oibda by approximately $100 million for fiscal 2018.

cable network programming (57% and 55% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively)
for fiscal 2017, revenues at the cable network programming segment increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and content and other revenues as shown below:

these revenue increases are net of a decrease of approximately $155 million due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies, primarily in latin america and europe, for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

for fiscal 2017, cable network programming segment oibda increased $456 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses of $645 million, or 7%. for fiscal 2017, the segment oibda increase is net of a decrease of approximately $60 million due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies as compared to fiscal 2016. the incremental revenues and expenses related to the ngs media business as a result of the acquisition were approximately $140 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
domestic channels for fiscal 2017, domestic affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber led by fox news and the rsns partially offset by the impact of lower average subscribers. also contributing to the increase were fs1 and fs2 due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher average subscribers and fx networks due to higher average rates per subscriber. for fiscal 2017, domestic advertising revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher ratings and pricing at fox news and the broadcasts of the mlb postseason games at fs1 partially offset by the impact of lower ratings at fx networks. the increase in domestic content and other revenues for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to the acquisition of the ngs media business and higher svod revenue.
for fiscal 2017, domestic channels oibda increased 10%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. operating expenses increased approximately $505 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, principally due to higher sports rights amortization, including the mlb, nba and national association of stock car auto racing ("nascar") rights at the company's sports channels, higher programming and marketing costs related to the launch of new programming at fx networks and national geographic and the acquisition of the ngs media business.
international channels for fiscal 2017, international affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of local currency growth of 11%, led by additional subscribers and higher rates at fngi in latin america and europe and at star. partially offsetting the affiliate fee increase for fiscal 2017 was the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies. for fiscal 2017, international advertising revenues decreased, as compared to fiscal 2016, as local currency growth at fngi in latin america and europe was more than offset by lower local currency advertising revenue at star due to the effect of the indian government's demonetization initiatives on the general advertising market in india, a lower volume of cricket matches broadcast in the current year and a decrease in market share. the adverse impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies also contributed to the decrease in international advertising revenue. the increase in international content and other revenues for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher network and syndication revenues in latin america and asia at fngi partially offset by lower syndication revenues related to sports rights at star.
for fiscal 2017, international channels oibda increased 4%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. operating expenses increased approximately $125 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher entertainment programming rights amortization at fngi in europe and latin america and at star partially offset by lower sports programming amortization at star, due to lower volume of cricket matches broadcast in the current year.
television (20% and 19% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively)
for fiscal 2017, revenues at the television segment increased $544 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and content and other revenues. advertising revenue increased 8% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to revenues resulting from the broadcast of super bowl li in february 2017 of approximately $425 million after agency

commissions, the mlb world series which benefited from higher ratings and two additional games, higher political advertising related to the 2016 u.s. elections, the broadcast of one additional nfl divisional playoff game and higher ratings and pricing of the nfl postseason. partially offsetting these increases in advertising revenue were lower entertainment advertising revenue at both fox and the company's television stations due to lower entertainment ratings at fox as compared to fiscal 2016, which included the final season of american idol and the emmy awards, and lower ratings for the broadcast of the nfl regular season. affiliate fee revenue increased 14% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of higher rates. content and other revenues increased 45% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher svod revenue at fox and revenue generated by one of the company's television stations granting a license to permit the commercial use of adjacent wireless spectrum in that market.
for fiscal 2017, television segment oibda increased $150 million, or 20%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $394 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2016. operating expenses increased approximately $440 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs at fox, including super bowl li and one additional nfl divisional playoff game, and higher advertising and promotion costs at fox related to new television series. partially offsetting these increases in operating expenses were a decrease in entertainment programming rights amortization at fox, primarily due to the absence of american idol and the mix of programming in the current year compared to the prior year. the increase in operating expenses noted above was partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.
filmed entertainment (29% and 31% of the company's consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively)
for fiscal 2017, revenues at the filmed entertainment segment decreased $270 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues from motion picture productions. partially offsetting these decreases were higher svod revenue from television productions, led by the licensing of homeland and the people v. o.j. simpson: american crime story, and higher network and syndication revenues from television productions, led by a number of new series licensed for distribution. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $65 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
the following feature film titles contributed significant revenues for fiscal 2017 and 2016:

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds. the company also has an unused $1.4 billion revolving credit facility, as amended, which expires in may 2020, and has access to various film co-financing alternatives to supplement its cash flows. in addition, the company has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. as of june 30, 2018, the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any violation of such covenants. the company's internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising markets and public acceptance of its film and television productions.
as of june 30, 2018, the company's consolidated assets included $7.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $1.1 billion was held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which, for certain balances, may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company. as a result of the tax act, the company will continue to evaluate whether or not to assert indefinite reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings as further guidance becomes available.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new motion pictures and television programs; the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expenses; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.
in addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the company's securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox).

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to net repayments over borrowings in the current year partially offset by the absence of stock repurchases in fiscal 2018.
stock repurchase program the company has a stock repurchase program, but did not repurchase any of its class a common stock or class b common stock during fiscal 2018. pursuant to the amended and restated merger agreement, the company is prohibited from repurchasing any additional shares without disney's consent (see note 12 - stockholders' equity to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "stock repurchase program").

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations          $3,795          $3,142
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily reflects higher operating results and the absence of a payment at the cable network programming segment to the board of control for cricket in india ("bcci") for contract termination costs related to a program rights contract for the champions league twenty20 ("clt20") cricket tournament through 2018 partially offset by higher tax payments and lower cash distributions received from sky (see note 7 - investments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox).

revolving credit agreement
21st century fox america, inc. ("21cfa"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, is party to a credit agreement providing a $1.4 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $250 million (or its equivalent in euros) available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of may 2020 (see note 11 - borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "revolving credit agreement").
bridge credit agreement to provide financing in connection with the sky acquisition, the company and 21cfa entered into a bridge credit agreement, which was subsequently amended (see note 3 - acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "sky acquisition").
commitments and contingent guarantees the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ("firm commitments") to make future payments. these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. the following table summarizes the company's material firm commitments as of june 30, 2018:

the company also has certain contractual arrangements in relation to certain subsidiaries and investees that would require the company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur ("contingent guarantees"). the company does not expect that these contingent guarantees will result in any material amounts being paid by the company in the foreseeable future. the timing of the amounts presented in the table below reflect when the maximum contingent guarantees will expire and does not indicate that the company expects to incur an obligation to make payments during that time frame.

in addition to the contingent guarantees above, the company is party to a capital funding agreement related to hulu.
for additional details on commitments and contingent guarantees see note 15 - commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the headings "operating leases and service agreements", "sports programming rights", "other commitments and contractual obligations" and "hulu indemnity".
pension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits the table excludes the company's pension, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. the company made contributions of $36 million and $98 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material contributions to its u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's pension plans. the company does not expect its net opeb payments to be material in fiscal 2019 (see note 16 - pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion of the company's pension and opeb plans).
contingencies see note 15 - commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "contingencies".
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its
64
application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. for the company's summary of significant accounting policies, see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox.
use of estimates see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "use of estimates".
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable, the product or service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured. the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
cable network programming and television advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. subscriber fees received from mvpds for cable network programming and television are recognized as affiliate fee revenue in the period services are provided.
the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with asc 605-50, "revenue recognition-customer payments and incentives." the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
filmed entertainment content revenues from the distribution of motion pictures and television series are recognized in accordance with asc 926. revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited, and revenues from home entertainment sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, are recognized on the date that dvd and blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers or when made available for viewing via digital distribution platforms and all company-imposed restrictions on the sale or availability have expired. revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television series is made available to the licensee for broadcast.
license agreements for the broadcast of motion pictures and television series in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for broadcast. cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of motion pictures and television series which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing agreement.
the company earns and recognizes revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties. in such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management's assessment of whether the company acts as the principal or agent in the transaction. to the extent the company acts as the principal in a transaction, revenues are reported on a gross basis. determining whether the company acts as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether the company has the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement.
65
filmed entertainment costs and programming rights filmed entertainment costs accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with asc 926, which requires management's judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments.
in accordance with asc 926, the company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management's estimated ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period from all media and markets for such title. management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each motion picture on the historical performance of similar motion pictures, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the motion picture, pre-release market research, the expected number of theaters in which the motion picture will be released and, once released, actual results of each motion picture. for each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
programming costs costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, "entertainment-broadcasters." program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. television broadcast network entertainment programming and cable network entertainment programming, which includes acquired series, series produced in-house, movies and other programs, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with programming rights, the company recognized impairment charges of $44 million, $91 million and $92 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for entertainment programming rights principally relating to programming that it will no longer broadcast (see note 6 - inventories, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion).
the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sporting events. the costs of multi-year national sports contracts at fox and the national sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period's attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. such changes in the future could be material. the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on fox and the national sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis.
the costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on an event-by-event basis while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis.
66
goodwill and intangible assets the company's intangible assets include goodwill, film and television libraries, federal communications commission ("fcc") licenses, mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income.
the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 "intangibles-goodwill and other." the company's impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing. the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations. this method also involves the use of management's judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the u.s. broadcast industry. the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.
during fiscal 2018, the company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of twenty-first century fox as of june 30, 2018 were not impaired. the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.
see note 10 - goodwill and intangible assets, net to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "annual impairment review" for further discussion.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities.
67
significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740, "income taxes".
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.
for information regarding the impact of the tax act, see note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox under the heading "u.s. tax reform".
employee costs the measurement and recognition of costs of the company's pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation and other actuarial assumptions.
the company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. the major pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants (with the exception of groups covered by collective bargaining agreements). in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, the company settled a portion of its pension obligations by irrevocably transferring pension liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts and/or through lump sum distributions. these transactions, primarily funded with pension plan assets, resulted in pre-tax settlement losses related to the recognition of accumulated deferred actuarial losses of $91 million, $39 million and $75 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. the company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the company considered the pension portfolio's future return expectations of the various asset classes. the expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 47% equity securities, 28% fixed income securities and 25% in other investments. the mortality assumptions reflect data from the mortality table released by the society of actuaries in fiscal 2015 and subsequently updated in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018.
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the primary plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds.
beginning in fiscal 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. this change in estimate did not have a material impact on the company's pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in fiscal 2017 (see note 16 - pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of twenty-first century fox for further discussion).
68
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:

the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s. and u.k. as of the measurement date. the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 4.2% in calculating the fiscal 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans. the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 6.7% for fiscal 2019 based principally on future return expectation of the plans' asset mix. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension plans as of june 30, 2018 were $449 million which decreased from $584 million as of june 30, 2017. this decrease of $135 million was primarily due to the settlement of pension obligations through the purchase of a group annuity contract and through lump sum distributions and the recognition of deferred losses related to amortization. the accumulated pre-tax net losses as of june 30, 2018 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company's accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation ("pbo") are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.
the company made contributions of $36 million, $98 million and $195 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its primary u.s. pension plans for the immediate future. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.
69
changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
changes in assumption                            impact on annual       impact on pbo pension expense

0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   increase $5 million   increase $60 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   decrease $5 million   decrease $56 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $3 million   -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $3 million   -
fiscal 2019 net periodic pension expense for the company's pension plans is expected to be approximately $65 million, which is consistent with fiscal 2018.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k. we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for reconciliation information of non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap.
comparability of results adoption of new accounting standards on january 1, 2018 we retrospectively adopted the accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers and the related amendments ("the new revenue standard"). concurrent with the adoption of the new revenue standard, we reclassified certain costs from selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales, to align the cost of providing the service with the recognition of service revenue. the new revenue standard was applied to all periods presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the beginning of the earliest year presented.
we also retrospectively adopted accounting standards update 2017-07 compensation - retirement benefits: improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, relating to the presentation of the components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits within the consolidated statement of income ("the new pension standard").
all comparisons and discussion throughout the md&a reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard and new pension standard. further information about the adoption of the accounting standards is included in note 2.
fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. fixed currency amounts during 2018 for argentina operations are reflected at the argentine peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.     comparability of reportable segments effective in the first quarter of 2018, we established the colloidal technologies group ("ctg") operating segment. the ctg operating segment has not been aggregated, based on qualitative criteria, and is included in other. ctg produces and sells colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water; these products and associated programs are used primarily for binding and polishing applications. ctg was previously recorded in the water operating segment which is aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment. prior to the sale in november 2017, the equipment care operating segment was also included, which provided kitchen repair and maintenance. additionally, we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. all comparisons and discussion throughout the md&a are based on the new operating segment structure effective in the first quarter of 2018.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture.

executive summary we achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2018 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally improved market environment. increased pricing was implemented to offset significantly higher delivered product costs. adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth, benefiting from lower interest expense and taxes, to deliver the year's double-digit adjusted diluted eps growth.      sales reported sales increased 6% to $14.7 billion in 2018 from $13.8 billion in 2017. sales were positively impacted by volume and pricing. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year.     gross margin our reported gross margin was 41.2% of sales for 2018, compared to our 2017 reported gross margin of 41.7%. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2018 and 2017, our adjusted gross margin was 41.3% in 2018 and 42.0% in 2017.      operating income reported operating income was flat at $1.95 billion in 2018, compared to $1.95 billion in 2017. adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 5% in 2018. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income also increased 5%.
earnings attributable to ecolab per common share ("eps")        reported diluted eps decreased 5% to $4.88 in 2018 compared to $5.12 in 2017. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation. special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of equipment care. special (gains) and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by energy related charges, restructuring charges, other gains and charges and venezuelan related actions. adjusted diluted eps, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased to $5.25 in 2018 compared to $4.68 in 2017.
balance sheet we remain committed to maintaining "a" range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/baa1 by the major ratings agencies. our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
net debt to ebitda our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") was 2.3 and 2.4 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. see the "net debt to ebitda" table on page 43 for reconciliation information.
cash flow cash flow from operating activities was $2.3 billion in 2018 compared to $2.1 billion in 2017. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.      dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend 12% in december 2018 to an indicated annual rate of $1.84 per share. the increase represents our 27th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 82nd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards committee 606 (asc 606), revenue from contracts with customers, which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized. for additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard, see note 2.
revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 840 leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.
our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive.
the new revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. in addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level.
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. in addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. actual results could differ from these estimates.
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $61 million and $72 million, as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $17 million and $15 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. however, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.
for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see note 2.

accrued liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position.
for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see note 15.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
·   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of aa when averaging available moody's investor services, standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings. the discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2018 and 2017, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2018, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 4.34% from 3.70% at year-end 2017. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2018, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 4.29% from 3.66% at year-end 2017.

·   the expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. our weighted-average expected return on u.s. plan assets used in determining the u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75% for 2017 and 2018 and 7.25% for 2019.

·   projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the u.s. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2017, 2018 and 2019.

·   for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2018, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.25% for pre-65 costs and 11.5% for post-65 costs. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.

·   in determining our u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2018, we utilized the most recent mortality table, mp-2018 projection scale (applied to the rp-2006 mortality table).

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our u.s. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $539 million as of december 31, 2018 from $527 million as of december 31, 2017 (both before tax), primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses.

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2018, on the december 31, 2018 funded status and 2019 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant u.s. plans:

expected return on assets   -0.25 pts                n/a                      -
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.      restructuring our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income. amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. our restructuring liability balance was $79 million and $42 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
for additional information on our restructuring activities, see note 3.

income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted, which reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (gilti), the base erosion anti abuse tax (beat) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (fdii).
we initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66 million, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance, finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 u.s. federal tax return and final balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. as of december 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
in january 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy to either treat taxes due on future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or factor such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the "deferred method"). we have elected the period cost method and have considered the estimated 2018 gilti impact in our 2018 tax expense.
additionally, proposed regulations were released during 2018. certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge; therefore, we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the tax act and not the proposed regulations. if the proposed regulations become final, we will record the impact at that time.
effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. in the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.
prior to the enactment of the tax act, u.s. deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. as part of the tax act, we recorded a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years. we will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes.
uncertain tax positions a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (ecolab and nalco) through 2014 and the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
30
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $50 million and $62 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
for additional information on income taxes see note 12.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets we periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.1 billion and $7.0 billion as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.        we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. if our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we had total goodwill of $7.1 billion and $7.2 billion as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.
for our 2018 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. the two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. our goodwill impairment assessment for 2018 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit's carrying amount by a significant margin. we will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented.
as part of the nalco merger, we added the "nalco" trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2018. based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. additionally, no events during the second half of 2018 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2018.

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table. our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.
our reported gross margin was 41.2%, 41.7%, and 42.7% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. our 2018, 2017 and 2016 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $9.3 million, $44.0 million, and $66.0 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the "special (gains) and charges" table on page 33.
excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2018 adjusted gross margin was 41.3% compared against a 2017 adjusted gross margin of 42.0%. the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs more than offsetting the impact from increased pricing and cost savings.
excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 42.0% and 43.2% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in global energy (which on average has a lower gross margin), which more than offset pricing and cost savings.

restructuring activities restructuring activities are comprised of actions taken in 2018 related to accelerate 2020 (described further below) and other actions taken in years prior to 2018. these activities have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3.     accelerate 2020
during the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the plan"), to leverage technology and systems investments and organizational changes. subsequent to year-end, we raised our goals for the plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements. we expect the expanded restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with anticipated costs of $260 million ($190 million after tax), or $0.65 per diluted share, over this period of time. costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. the restructuring actions are expected to result in approximately $325 million of annual cost savings by 2021.
we recorded restructuring charges of $104.6 million ($79.6 million after tax), or $0.27 per diluted share in 2018. the liability related to this plan was $63.9 million as of the end of the year.
other restructuring activities prior to 2018, we engaged in a number of restructuring plans. during 2017, we commenced restructuring and other cost-saving actions in order to streamline our operations. these actions include a reduction of our global workforce, as well as asset disposals and lease terminations. actions were substantially completed in 2017. we also have restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2016. during 2018, net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were $3.1 million ($2.4 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. during 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $44.5 million ($32.3 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share. during 2016, we recorded restructuring gains of $9.1 million ($10.8 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. the restructuring liability balance for all plans commencing prior to 2018 was $14.9 million and $41.5 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. the majority of pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. cash payments during 2018 related to restructuring plans commencing prior to 2018 were $22.7 million.

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.
our reported operating income remained flat when comparing 2018 to 2017 and increased 4% when comparing 2017 to 2016. our reported operating income for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2018 adjusted operating income increased 5% when compared to 2017 adjusted operating income and 2017 adjusted operating income increased 1% when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income.
as shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2018 and 2017.

reported net interest expense totaled $222.3 million, $255.0 million and $264.6 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
during 2018, in conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense.
during 2017, in anticipation of u.s. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share.
the decrease in our 2018 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2017 was driven primarily by lower interest rates on debt. the decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt.

provision for income taxes the following table provides a summary of our tax rate:

non-gaap adjusted tax rate          20.3   %         23.8   %         25.2   %
our reported tax rate was 20.2%, 13.8%, and 24.4% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. the enactment of the tax act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate.
we recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of $4.7 million during 2018. in the third quarter of 2018, we filed u.s. federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of $39.9 million related to changes in estimates and an irs approved method change. u.s. tax reform (as described further below) resulted in $66.0 million expense for 2018. share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $28.1 million in 2018. the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in non-u.s. jurisdictions, audit settlements and both international and u.s. changes in estimates.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted, which reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (gilti), the base erosion anti abuse tax (beat) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (fdii). in january 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or factor such amounts into a company's measurement of our deferred taxes (the "deferred method"). we have elected the period cost method and considered the estimated 2018 gilti impact in our 2018 tax expense.
we initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160.1 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66.0 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the tax act, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits. our 2017 reported rate also includes a $319.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the u.s. enacted tax rate of 21%. our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of u.s. tax reform of $7.8 million. during 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits. in addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 u.s. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters.
our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special (gains) and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. the net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 u.s. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions.
the change in our adjusted tax rate from 2016 to 2018 was primarily driven by enactment of the tax act, global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the tax act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2016 to 2018 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable ("working capital"), the combination of which increased $192 million, $56 million and $35 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. the cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments.
the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table:

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.
total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $221 million, $870 million and $49 million, respectively. our acquisitions and divestitures across 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed further in note 4. we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.
we continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. total capital expenditures were $847 million, $869 million and $757 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. we repurchased a total of $562 million, $600 million, and $740 million of shares in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased in 2017 and 2016 through our accelerated stock repurchase ("asr") programs. see note 10 for further information regarding our asr programs.

in december 2018, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 12%. this represents the 27th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. we have paid dividends on our common stock for 82 consecutive years. cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows:

liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $115 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, substantially all of which was held outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2017, we had $211 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $151 million was held outside of the u.s.
as of december 31, 2018 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in november 2022. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our u.s. commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. at year-end, we had $141.4 million (€125.0 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the euro commercial paper program and $24.0 million outstanding under the u.s. commercial paper program. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2018 or 2017. as of december 31, 2018, both programs were rated a-2 by standard & poor's, p-2 by moody's and f-2 by fitch.
additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. these credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. we have $150 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.
as of december 31, 2018, standard & poor's and fitch both rated our long-term credit at a- (stable outlook) and moody's rated our long-term credit at baa1 (stable outlook). a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.
we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.

*interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2018.
as of december 31, 2018, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $50 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2019. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $48 million in 2019. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.

off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as discussed further in note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.     market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2018, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2018, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $400 million.
see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.
based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $258 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment energy markets approximately 23% of our sales are generated from our global energy segment, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets.
during 2018, oil industry drilling and production activity showed improved volumes over 2017, led by strong gains in north america drilling and production activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends, while international activity remained soft. demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016.
our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. as such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.
global economies approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the argentine peso, and increasing borrowing rates. argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with u.s. gaap, and the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina. during 2018, sales in argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. assets held in argentina at the end of 2018 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.

brexit referendum on march 29, 2017, the united kingdom ("u.k.") government gave formal notice to the european union ("eu") to begin the process of negotiating the u.k.'s exit ("brexit") from the eu. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. the negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between the u.k. and eu. in the longer term, any impact from brexit on our u.k. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. we will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the u.k. and eu.
during 2018, net sales of our u.k. operations were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales.
new accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 2.
subsequent events acquisitions subsequent to year-end, we closed on the acquisition of bioquell plc, a leading provider of hydrogen peroxide vapor bio-decontamination systems and services for the life sciences and healthcare industries and acquired lobster ink, a leading provider of end-to-end online customer training solutions. we also entered into various purchase and sale agreements which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. none of the agreements are significant to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate.         upstream energy spin-off ecolab intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by ecolab's board of directors and any regulatory approvals, a plan to separate and spin-off the upstream group of ecolab's global energy segment (the upstream business) through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the spin-off). under the plan, if effectuated, ecolab's shareholders would own 100% of the common stock of a new corporation that owns the upstream business. the spin-off is expected to be completed in 2020 and is intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to ecolab shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
in anticipation of and to facilitate the spin-off, ecolab is currently planning for the internal separation of the upstream business through a series of transactions that are intended to be tax-efficient from a u.s. federal income tax perspective. the spin-off is expected to consist of two phases: (i) a series of internal transactions undertaken by ecolab and its direct and indirect subsidiaries to separate the upstream business from ecolab's other businesses, including multiple distributions intended to qualify as tax-free distributions for u.s. federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code (collectively, the internal separations), followed by (ii) an external distribution by ecolab of the common stock of a newly-formed corporation owning the upstream business to current ecolab shareholders owning ecolab shares in a distribution that is intended to qualify as tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code.
the internal separations are currently expected to occur in the united states and in (or involving entities domiciled in) various other jurisdictions, including (but not limited to) luxembourg, the netherlands, jersey, saudi arabia, the united kingdom, singapore and switzerland. in particular, the ecolab subsidiaries (which shall also include any of their successors and transferees) that are anticipated to be distributing corporations in connection with the internal separations include: ecolab lux 9 s.à r.l., ecolab nl 11 b.v., nalco overseas holding b.v., nalco holding b.v.,  ecolab lux 11 s.à r.l., ecolab lux 10 s.à r.l., ecolab u.s. 2 inc., ecolab lux 7 s.à r.l., ecolab ch 2 gmbh, ecolab nl 3 b.v., ecolab lux 1 s.à r.l., ecolab lux 2 s.à r.l., nalco saudi co. ltd., nalco gulf limited, nalco manufacturing ltd., ecolab pte. ltd., ecolab usa inc., nalco holding company and nalco u.s. 2 inc. in addition, certain ecolab subsidiaries (or their respective successors and transferees) listed on exhibit (21.1) may also be distributing corporations in connection with the internal separations.

  adjusted interest expense, net
  ebitda
  adjusted tax rate
  adjusted net income attributable to ecolab

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of franklin resources, inc. ("franklin") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" disclosure set forth in part i and the "risk factors" set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k and in any more recent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.
overview we are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through our investment products which include our sponsored funds, as well as institutional and high net-worth separate accounts. in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, marketing, shareholder servicing, and other services. our products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to investors globally under various distinct brand names, including: franklin®, templeton®, franklin mutual series®, franklin bissett®, fiduciary trusttm, darby®, balanced equity management®, k2®, libertyshares® and edinburgh partnerstm. we offer a broad product mix of equity, multi-asset/balanced, fixed income and cash management funds and accounts, including alternative investment products, which meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. we also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management ("aum"). as noted in the "risk factors" section set forth above in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k, the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. the level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales, the number of shareholder transactions and accounts, and the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds or our clients. these arrangements could change in the future.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 ("fiscal year 2018"), the global equity markets experienced volatility but provided strong positive returns, reflecting, among other things, generally positive u.s. economic data tempered by concerns about rising interest rates, global trade tensions and political uncertainty, as the s&p 500 index and msci world index increased 17.9% and 11.8%. the global bond markets were negatively impacted by rising interest rates and the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index decreased 1.3% for the fiscal year.
our total aum was $717.1 billion at september 30, 2018, 5% lower than at september 30, 2017 as $38.0 billion of net outflows and $7.9 billion of net market change, distributions and other were partially offset by $9.8 billion from an acquisition. simple monthly average aum ("average aum") increased slightly during fiscal year 2018.
the business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations and registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business and add complexity to our global compliance operations.
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. we continuously perform reviews of our business model. while we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. we will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the "risk factors" section in part i of this annual report.

1    defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues.
operating income decreased $145.7 million in fiscal year 2018 due to a 1% decrease in operating revenues and a 2% increase in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. decreased $932.3 million primarily due to an estimated income tax charge of $968.8 million resulting from enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017.
operating income decreased $101.4 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 ("fiscal year 2017") as a 3% decrease in operating revenues was partially offset by a 3% decrease in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. decreased $30.0 million as the decrease in operating income was significantly offset by a $152.3 million increase in investment and other income, net, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests.
diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year 2018 consistent with net income and increased in fiscal year 2017 despite the decrease in net income. the amounts were impacted by 4% decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding in both periods primarily resulting from repurchases of shares of our common stock.

aum decreased $36.1 billion or 5% during fiscal year 2018 due to $38.0 billion of net outflows and $7.9 billion of net market change, distributions and other, partially offset by $9.8 billion from an acquisition. the net outflows included outflows of $7.6 billion from seven institutional products, $6.0 billion from three global/international fixed income funds with global macro strategies, $4.5 billion from two global/international equity funds, $4.1 billion from a multi-asset/balanced fund and $0.9 billion from a fixed income tax-free fund, and were partially offset by inflows of $3.3 billion in a global/international fixed income fund that introduced a new share class structure during fiscal year 2017, $3.0 billion in two institutional products and $1.2 billion in a multi-asset/balanced fund. long-term sales decreased 7% to $105.0 billion from the prior year due to lower sales in all long-term investment objectives with the exception of u.s. equity. long-term redemptions decreased 4% to $162.1 billion due to lower redemptions in all long-term investment objectives with the exception of tax-free fixed income. net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $25.3 billion of long-term distributions and a $4.7 billion decrease from foreign exchange revaluation, partially offset by $19.1 billion of market appreciation. the foreign exchange revaluation resulted from aum in products that are not u.s. dollar denominated, which represented 15% of total aum as of september 30, 2018, and was primarily due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the indian rupee, canadian dollar and australian dollar. the market appreciation occurred primarily in equity and multi-asset/balanced products, partially offset by depreciation in global/international fixed income products, and reflected positive returns in global equity markets as evidenced by increases of 11.8% and 17.9% in the msci world index and s&p 500 index and negative returns in global fixed income markets as evidenced by a 1.3% decrease in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index.
aum increased $19.9 billion or 3% during fiscal year 2017 primarily due to $58.1 billion of net market change, distributions and other, partially offset by $38.6 billion of net outflows. net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $78.0 billion of market appreciation and a $2.9 billion increase from foreign exchange revaluation, net of $23.0 billion of long-term distributions. the market appreciation occurred primarily in equity, global/international fixed income and multi-asset/balanced products, and reflected positive returns in global markets, as evidenced by increases of 18.8% and 18.6% in the msci world index and s&p 500 index, and strong performance of our global/international fixed income products despite a 1.3% decrease in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index. the foreign exchange revaluation resulted from aum in products that are not u.s. dollar denominated, which represented 14% of total aum as of september 30, 2017, and was primarily due to weakening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar and euro. the net outflows included $8.1 billion from two global/international fixed income funds with global macro strategies, $3.9 billion from three institutional separate accounts, $3.0 billion from two sub-advised variable annuity clients due to shifts in their investment strategies, $2.6 billion from two global/international equity funds, $1.2 billion from a multi-asset/balanced fund and $1.0 billion from a u.s. equity fund, and were partially offset by inflows of $4.0 billion in a global/international fixed income fund. long-term sales increased 10% to $112.3 billion from the prior year due to higher sales in all long-term investment objectives with the exception of tax-free fixed income. long-term redemptions decreased 9% to $169.7 billion primarily due to lower redemptions of global/international fixed income products.

1    latin america sales region includes north america-based advisers serving non-resident clients.
the percentage of average aum in the united states sales region was 66%, 67% and 68% for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region.
investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. a standard measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians. our global/international fixed income products generated notable long-term results with at least 65% of aum exceeding the benchmarks and peer group medians for the three-, five- and ten-year periods ended september 30, 2018. the performance of our multi-asset/balanced products significantly exceeded the peer group medians for the three- and ten-year periods, but has lagged in the other comparisons, reflecting the performance of a fund that represents 68% of this category. the performance of our tax-free and u.s. taxable fixed income, as well as of our equity products, has mostly lagged the benchmarks and peer group medians during the periods presented.

investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our investment products and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of the market value of aum. annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. rates for products sold outside of the u.s. are generally higher than for u.s. products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs.
investment management fees increased $8.3 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a slight increase in average aum partially offset by lower performance fees. investment management fees decreased $112.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in average aum and the impact of a lower effective fee rate, partially offset by higher performance fees. average aum increases in fiscal year 2018 in the asia-pacific and europe, middle east and africa sales regions were largely offset by a decrease in the u.s. the decrease in average aum in fiscal year 2017 occurred primarily in the global/international fixed income investment objective, and across all sales regions except asia-pacific.
our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average aum) was 59.0, 59.2 and 59.7 basis points for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to lower performance fees. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to higher weightings of aum in lower fee products in the global/international fixed income investment objective in the europe, middle east and africa and asia-pacific sales regions, partially offset by higher performance fees.
performance-based investment management fees were $21.2 million, $35.5 million and $26.5 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, with the changes primarily due to performance fees earned from separate accounts.
u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were as follows:

________________
1   u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper, a thomson reuters company, as of september 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and include all u.s.-registered open-end funds that reported expense data to lipper as of the funds' most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. as defined by lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included.
2   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 reflect higher weightings of two large low-fee passive funds.
3   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 reflect higher weightings of a large low-fee passive fund and lower weightings of two large higher-fee actively managed funds.
the declines in u.s. industry average management fee rates for long-term investment objectives generally reflect increased investor demand for lower-fee passive funds. our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the u.s. industry average rates as we actively manage substantially all of our products and have a higher level of international aum, both of which generate higher fees. our effective investment management fee rates in the u.s. decreased during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 to a lesser extent than the average industry rates.
our product offerings and global operations are diverse. as such, the impact of future changes in the market value of aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.
37
sales and distribution fees we earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase ("commissionable sales"). sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. therefore, sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors.
our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. specifically, the majority of u.s.-registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under rule 12b-1 (the "rule 12b-1 plans") promulgated under the investment company act of 1940. the rule 12b-1 plans permit the mutual funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the rule 12b-1 plans' limitations on amounts based on average daily net aum. similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non-u.s. funds.
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf. see the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.
sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below.

asset-based distribution fees decreased $30.8 million in fiscal year 2018 as a $60.3 million decrease in u.s. product fees primarily due to a 5% decrease in the related average u.s. aum was partially offset by a $29.5 million increase in non-u.s. product fees primarily due to a 4% increase in the related average international aum. asset-based distribution fees decreased $65.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a $55.2 million decrease from a 4% decrease in the related average total aum.
sales-based fees decreased $80.5 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to an $84.6 million decrease from a 26% decrease in total commissionable sales. sales-based fees decreased $35.6 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $18.8 million from lower effective fee rates and $18.5 million from a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. the lower effective fee rates primarily resulted from a higher mix of non-u.s. product fixed income sales and tiered pricing on larger trades. non-u.s. products typically generate lower sales fees than u.s. products, and fixed income products typically generate lower sales fees than equity products. total commissionable sales increased 4% in fiscal year 2017, however the increase resulted from significantly higher sales of non-u.s. products which were largely offset by lower sales of u.s. products; the lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales resulted in a net decrease in sales-based fees.
commissionable sales represented 9% of total sales for fiscal year 2018, 11% for fiscal year 2017, and 12% for fiscal year 2016, with u.s. product commissionable sales representing 74%, 72% and 92% of total commissionable sales.
contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. these charges are levied only on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares. contingent sales charges increased $5.5 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to higher redemptions of non-u.s. products.
shareholder servicing fees we earn shareholder servicing fees from our sponsored funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. effective november 1, 2017, the fees for u.s. funds changed to be based on the level of aum and number of transactions in shareholder accounts from the prior structure of a fixed charge per shareholder account that varied by fund type and service provided. outside of the u.s., the fees are based on the level of aum and/or the number of shareholder accounts.
38
we also provide other services to individual and trust clients, including trust services, for which fees are based on the level of aum, and estate planning and tax planning and preparation, for which fees are primarily account based.
shareholder servicing fees decreased $3.8 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a $4.9 million decrease from u.s. funds which reflects lower levels of transactions and aum under the new fee structure, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase from funds in europe resulting from higher levels of related aum. shareholder servicing fees decreased $17.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $14.8 million from u.s. funds resulting from a decrease in active accounts and $3.6 million from funds in europe resulting from lower levels of related aum and active accounts.
other other revenue increased $28.2 million and $5.4 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 primarily due to higher interest and dividend income from consolidated investment products ("cips").

sales, distribution and marketing sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily consist of payments to financial advisers, broker-dealers and other third parties for providing services to investors in our sponsored funds, including marketing support services. sales expenses are determined as percentages of sales and are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues. distribution expenses are determined as percentages of aum and are incurred from assets that generate either distribution fees or higher levels of investment management fees. marketing support expenses are based on aum, sales or a combination thereof. also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to up-front commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge. the deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

asset-based expenses decreased $31.9 million in fiscal year 2018 as a $60.8 million decrease in u.s. product expenses primarily due to a 5% decrease in the related average u.s. aum was partially offset by a $28.9 million increase in non-u.s. product expenses primarily due to a 2% increase in the related average international aum. asset-based expenses decreased $56.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a $62.4 million decrease from a 3% decrease in the related average total aum. distribution expenses, which are typically higher for non-u.s. products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees.
39
sales-based expenses decreased $68.0 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a $75.0 million decrease from a 26% decrease in total commissionable sales, partially offset by a $4.4 million increase from a higher average commission rate resulting from a higher mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. u.s. products typically generate higher sales commissions than non-u.s. products.
sales-based expenses decreased $18.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million from lower average commission rates and $9.0 million from a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. the lower average commission rates primarily resulted from a higher mix of non-u.s. product fixed income sales and tiered pricing on larger trades. fixed income products typically generate lower sales commissions than equity products. total commissionable sales increased 4% in fiscal year 2017, however the increase resulted from significantly higher sales of non-u.s. products that were largely offset by lower sales of u.s. products; the lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales resulted in a net decrease in sales-based expenses.
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $8.7 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a $21.0 million increase from higher sales of non-u.s. shares sold without a front-end sales charge, partially offset by a $12.0 million decrease from lower such sales of u.s. shares. amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $3.2 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to an $18.5 million decrease related to lower sales of u.s. shares sold without a front-end sales charge, substantially offset by $12.7 million of adjustments recognized in fiscal year 2016 related to prior-year amortization expense and $4.3 million from higher sales of non-u.s. shares sold without a front-end sales charge.
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses increased $56.9 million in fiscal year 2018 due to a $69.1 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits, partially offset by a $12.2 million decrease in variable compensation. the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to increases of $25.1 million from higher average staffing levels, $21.9 million for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2017 and 2016, $14.2 million in termination benefits and $6.5 million from unfavorable foreign currency impacts. the decrease in variable compensation was primarily due to decreases of $24.0 million related to unvested mutual fund awards and $5.5 million in stock and stock unit award amortization, partially offset by a $14.2 million increase in bonus expense primarily due to higher staffing levels.
compensation and benefit expenses decreased $27.2 million in fiscal year 2017 due to a $55.7 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, partially offset by a $28.5 million increase in variable compensation. the decrease in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to decreases of $51.4 million in termination benefits and $19.9 million from a higher weighting of employees in lower cost regions outside the u.s., partially offset by an $18.3 million increase for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2016 and 2015. the increase in variable compensation was primarily due to increases of $13.1 million from higher market valuations of mutual fund awards, $13.1 million in bonus expense based on our overall performance and $6.5 million from higher sales-related commissions, partially offset by an $8.3 million decrease in amortization of stock and stock unit awards.
variable compensation as a percentage of compensation and benefits was 33%, 36% and 33% for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. at september 30, 2018, our global workforce had increased to approximately 9,700 employees from approximately 9,400 at september 30, 2017.
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. as such, any changes in the underlying performance of our investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. however, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.

information systems and technology information systems and technology expenses increased $24.1 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to higher technology consulting and software costs, and increased $12.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to higher external data service and software costs.

occupancy we conduct our worldwide operations using a combination of leased and owned facilities. occupancy expenses include rent and other facilities-related costs including depreciation and utilities.
occupancy expenses increased $7.3 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to $6.6 million of equipment impairment, and decreased $12.8 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower rent expense.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of fund-related service fees payable to external parties, professional fees, advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses.
general, administrative and other operating expenses increased $75.5 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to higher contingent consideration expense, third-party service fees, professional fees, advertising and promotion, and travel and entertainment expenses. contingent consideration expense increased $26.9 million due to revised estimates of future revenues and profits from k2 advisors holdings, llc ("k2") and a prior-year decline in other acquisition-related aum. third-party fees primarily for sub-advisory and fund administration services increased $17.6 million, professional fees increased $16.6 million related to various corporate activities, and advertising and promotion and travel and entertainment expenses increased $7.3 million and $6.6 million due to higher activity levels.
general, administrative and other operating expenses decreased $17.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower expenses related to intangible assets and contingent consideration, partially offset by higher cips, advertising and promotion, and travel and entertainment expenses. definite-lived intangible asset impairment decreased $18.6 million and amortization expense decreased $6.5 million, both primarily resulting from a prior-year impairment related to the k2 acquisition. contingent consideration expense decreased $12.8 million due to revised estimates of k2's future revenues and profits and a decline in other acquisition-related aum. the decreases were partially offset by increases of $9.8 million in cips expenses, $6.7 million in advertising and promotion expenses and $4.5 million in travel and entertainment expenses.
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. as a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenses may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues.

investment and other income, net consists primarily of interest and dividend income, income from equity method investees, gains (losses) on investments of cips and trading investment securities, rental income and foreign currency exchange gains (losses).
other income, net decreased $188.2 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to losses on investments held by cips, lower income from equity method investees and lower net gains on trading investment securities, partially offset by higher dividend income and foreign exchange gains. investments held by cips generated net losses of $55.0 million, as compared to net gains of $118.2 million in the prior year. the losses were primarily from lower market valuations of holdings by an emerging markets equity fund with a significant exposure in turkey, several global/international fixed income funds and a u.s. fixed income fund. income from equity method investees decreased $63.5 million primarily due to lower gains and losses on investments held by three global equity funds, one of which incurred losses on turkish holdings, and a global macro hedge fund. net gains on trading investment securities decreased $11.1 million primarily due to losses and lower gains from fixed income funds and other debt and equity securities. the decreases were partially offset by a $37.2 million increase in dividend income primarily due to higher investments in, and yields on, money market funds, and net foreign currency exchange gains of $0.6 million, as compared to net losses of $16.0 million in the prior year, primarily from the impact of strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in u.s. dollars held in europe.
other income, net increased $150.7 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to gains on investments held by cips and higher income from equity method investees and interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on trading investment securities and net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities. investments held by cips generated net gains of $118.2 million, as compared to net losses of $13.5 million in the prior year. the gains were primarily from higher market valuations of holdings by various global/international private equity funds and from a net increase of 20 cips due to adoption of new accounting guidance on october 1, 2016. income from equity method investees increased $51.2 million primarily due to gains on investments held by a global macro hedge fund and a global equity fund. interest income increased $38.4 million primarily due to higher levels of interest rates and debt securities. the increases were partially offset by a $37.9 million decrease in net gains on trading investment securities primarily due to lower gains from fixed income funds, partially offset by gains on corporate debt securities, as compared to losses in the prior year, and a $24.9 million decrease in net realized gains on sale of available-for-sale securities. the investments in sponsored funds that were classified as trading securities and available-for-sale securities in the prior year were significantly reduced on october 1, 2016 as a substantial amount of the investments were in funds that were consolidated as a result of the new accounting guidance.
significant portions of the net gains (losses) of cips are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.
our investments in sponsored funds include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. the market conditions that impact our aum similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our investments in sponsored funds.

taxes on income as a multi-national corporation, we provide many of our services from locations outside the u.s. some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the u.s. additionally, in certain countries our income is subject to reduced tax rates due to tax rulings. the mix of pre-tax income subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the u.s., produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing u.s. federal and state income tax rates.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted into law in the u.s. on december 22, 2017. the tax act includes various changes to the tax law, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 and assessment of a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings. the estimated effects of the changes in the tax rate and laws resulting from the tax act were recognized during the quarter ended december 31, 2017, and were subsequently revised based on completion of certain tax return filings, additional technical guidance from the department of treasury and various states, and further refinement of the transition tax calculation. as of september 30, 2018, we have completed our analysis of the tax act impact except for the transition tax, which is expected to be completed within one year of the tax act enactment date.
the transition tax expense was estimated to be $983.2 million as of september 30, 2018 and may be adjusted in the future upon issuance of additional technical guidance, legislative updates from states on tax reform, and the completion of our tax return filings for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. the estimate includes an $87.6 million tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 related to u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year. this benefit may be reduced or eliminated by future regulation or legislation. the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate income tax rate resulted in a net tax benefit of $53.3 million during fiscal year 2018.
43
the federal statutory rate for fiscal year 2018 is a blended rate of 24.5% based on the pre- and post-tax act rates, and will be 21% for future fiscal years.
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 66.5% as compared to 29.8% in fiscal year 2017 and 29.7% in fiscal year 2016. the rate increase in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of the transition tax, partially offset by the lower federal statutory rate and the net tax benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 excluding the one-time impacts of the tax act was 22.7%. the rate increase in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to foreign earnings subject to u.s. taxes and the prior-year recognition of tax benefits in u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions as a result of various adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits including the expiration of statutes of limitations, substantially offset by higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non-u.s. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates. changes in tax rates in these jurisdictions and in our estimated impacts from the tax act may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.

net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a decrease in trading securities of cips as compared to an increase in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in our trading securities as compared to a decrease in the prior year. net cash used in investing activities, as compared to net cash provided in the prior year, primarily resulted from net purchases of investments of cips, as compared to net liquidations in the prior year, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to higher dividends paid on common stock, lower net subscriptions in cips by noncontrolling interests and higher repurchases of common stock, partially offset by lower payments on debt by cips.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a larger net increase in trading securities of cips. net cash provided by investing activities decreased mainly due to net purchases of the company's investments, as compared to net liquidations in the prior year, and the adoption of new accounting guidance. net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to net subscriptions in cips by noncontrolling interests, as compared to net distributions in the prior year, and lower repurchases of common stock, partially offset by payments on the company's debt, higher payments on debt by cips and prior-year proceeds from a loan.
the assets and liabilities of cips attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. we have no right to the cips' assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management fees earned from them. the debt holders of the cips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the cips' liabilities. accordingly, the assets and liabilities of cips, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.

our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:

as of september 30,                        2018                  2017                  2016
assets cash and cash equivalents          $6,610.8              $8,523.3              $8,247.1
receivables                           733.7                 767.8                 746.4
investments                         2,130.6               1,995.2               1,896.7
total liquid assets                $9,475.1             $11,286.3             $10,890.2
liability debt                                 $695.9              $1,044.2              $1,401.2
liquidity liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and certain investments. cash and cash equivalents at september 30, 2018 primarily consist of money market funds and deposits with financial institutions, and in prior years also included debt instruments and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less at the purchase date. liquid investments consist of trading and available-for-sale securities, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual funds, direct investments in redeemable cips, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.
we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions relating to our products. certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents. as a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. at september 30, 2018, our subsidiaries held $3,382.6 million of liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions to our products, as compared to $3,481.9 million held at september 30, 2017. included in these amounts were liquid assets restricted by regulatory requirements from transfer to franklin and other subsidiaries of $252.6 million at september 30, 2018 and $167.4 million at september 30, 2017. should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases, or we could raise capital through debt or equity issuance. these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings.
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted private placement program.
in prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. at september 30, 2018, $699.3 million of the notes were outstanding with an aggregate face value of $700.0 million. the notes were issued at fixed interest rates and consist of $300.0 million at 2.800% per annum which mature in 2022 and $400.0 million at 2.850% per annum which mature in 2025.
interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. the notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. the indentures governing the notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. the indentures also include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2018.
at september 30, 2018, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012.

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, repurchase shares of our common stock, invest in our products, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and income taxes, and repay and service debt.
prior to enactment of the tax act, we indefinitely reinvested the undistributed earnings of all non-u.s. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the u.s. or subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements. effective january 1, 2018, we intend to repatriate the earnings in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements for substantially all non-u.s. subsidiaries.
we declare dividends on a quarterly basis. we declared regular cash dividends of $0.92 per share ($0.23 per share per quarter) and a special dividend of $3.00 per share in fiscal year 2018 and regular cash dividends of $0.80 per share ($0.20 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2017. we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 39.9 million and 19.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1,426.7 million and $771.5 million. at september 30, 2018, 71.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program, which is not subject to an expiration date. on april 11, 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 80.0 million shares of our common stock in either open market or private transactions. the size and timing of these purchases will depend on price, market and business conditions and other factors.
during fiscal year 2018, we paid $86.8 million, net of cash acquired, and issued 0.8 million shares of our common stock related to acquisitions. on october 24, 2018, we entered into an acquisition agreement with a purchase consideration of approximately $683 million in cash.
on may 21, 2018, we redeemed our outstanding $350.0 million 4.625% senior notes due in may 2020 at a make-whole redemption price of $361.9 million.
we redeemed $105.9 million, net of investments, from our sponsored products during fiscal year 2018, and invested $4.2 million, net of redemptions, during fiscal year 2017.
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. while we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. in july 2018, we purchased $32.6 million of certain equity and debt securities from two sponsored funds. we did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during fiscal year 2017.

the debt holders of cips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments, therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities' liabilities and have not included them in the table above. see note 9 - consolidated investment products in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
at september 30, 2018, our consolidated balance sheet included liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $77.5 million and related accrued interest of $11.3 million (see note 11 - taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k). because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of future cash outflows, unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest are not included in the table above.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. these estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. actual results could differ from the estimates. described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. for additional information about our accounting policies, see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. we have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity ("voe") or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie").
47
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity's legal organization and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. substantially all of our vies are investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products.
we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. investment management fees earned from vies are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. the key estimates and assumptions used in the analyses include the amount of aum and the life of the investment product. these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. for example, aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, distributions to investors and reinvested distributions. there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. as of september 30, 2018, we were the primary beneficiary of 29 investment product vies.
fair value measurements a substantial amount of our investments are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. we use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. the assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k for more information on the fair value hierarchy.
as of september 30, 2018, level 3 assets represented 14% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to cips' investments in equity and debt securities that are not traded in active markets. there was one level 3 liability, a contingent consideration liability which represented 81% of total liabilities measured at fair value. there were no transfers into or out of level 3 during fiscal year 2018.
following are descriptions of the significant assets and liability measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies.
investment securities, trading consist of nonconsolidated sponsored funds, debt and other equity securities. the fair values of all funds and certain other equity securities are determined based on their published net asset values ("nav"). the fair values of debt and certain other equity securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs.
investment securities, available-for-sale consist primarily of nonconsolidated sponsored funds and, to a lesser extent, debt and other equity securities. the fair value of funds is determined based on their published nav. the fair value of debt securities is primarily determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes. the fair value of other equity securities is determined using quoted market prices.
investment securities, available-for-sale are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery, and the financial condition of and specific events related to the issuer.
investments of cips consist of trading securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. the fair value of trading securities is determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. the investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of debt and equity securities of entities in emerging markets and fund products. the fair values of the debt and equity securities are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach. the fair value of fund products is estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
48
contingent consideration liability consists of the expected future payments related to our commitment to acquire the remaining interests in k2. the liability is determined using the net present value of anticipated future cash flows based on estimated future revenue and profits and timing of payments.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. other intangible assets consist of investment management contracts acquired in business acquisitions. we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to 15 years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period.
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an ongoing basis.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. we have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned.
we may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. a quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. quantitative tests compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.
fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows which include assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate, effective tax rate and discount rate, which is based on our weighted-average cost of capital. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and the discount rate.
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of august 1, 2018. we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of the valuation of goodwill and 88% of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting unit and the specific intangible assets exceed their carrying values. we performed a quantitative test for the remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets and did not recognize any impairment because our estimated fair values of the assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 20%.
we subsequently monitor market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that the indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. we considered, among other things, changes in our aum and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of august 1, 2018. we also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. subsequent to august 1, 2018, there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired.
while we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment.
revenues investment management, distribution and shareholder servicing fees are recognized as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance-based investment management fees which are recognized when earned. sales commissions related to the sale of shares of sponsored funds are recognized on trade date. investment management fees, other than performance-based fees, and distribution fees are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using average daily aum. performance-based investment management fees are based on performance targets established
49
in the related investment management contracts. shareholder servicing fees are based on factors such as aum, transactions and shareholder accounts established in the related service contracts.
aum is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by our investment products and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate significant unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. pricing of the securities is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. as of september 30, 2018, our total aum by fair value hierarchy level was 54% level 1, 45% level 2 and 1% level 3.
as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
as a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the u.s. and generate earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. prior to enactment of the tax act, we indefinitely reinvested the undistributed earnings of all our non-u.s. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the u.s. or subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements. effective january 1, 2018, we intend to repatriate earnings in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements for substantially all of our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. in management's opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of september 30, 2018 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. see also note 12 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.

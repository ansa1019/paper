item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with item 6. "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." the discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements." factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.  overview as of december 31, 2018, we operated 2,452 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states, 37 international chipotle restaurants, and two non-chipotle restaurants. we are committed to making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose.
2018 financial and operational highlights    sales trends. average restaurant sales were $2.004 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase from $1.940 million for the year ended december 30, 2017. we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12-month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months.
comparable restaurant sales increased 4.0% for the full year 2018 and increased 6.1%, which included a 2% increase in comparable restaurant transactions, for the three months ended december 31, 2018. comparable restaurant sales and comparable restaurant transactions represent the change in period-over-period sales or paid transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months. we expect our full year 2019 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the mid-single digit range.
we continue to invest in improving our digital platforms and equipping select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling out-of-restaurant orders. sales from out-of-restaurant orders, including delivery orders, increased 260 basis points to 10.9% of revenue for the full year 2018, an increase from 8.3% of revenue for the full year 2017.
restaurant operating costs. during the full year 2018, our restaurant operating costs (food, beverage and packaging; labor; occupancy; and other operating costs) as a percentage of revenue decreased 180 basis points to 81.3% compared to the full year 2017. the decrease was primarily due to comparable restaurant sales increases combined with lower marketing and promotional expenses, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew level.
corporate restructuring. during 2018, we opened a new headquarters office in newport beach, california, consolidated certain corporate administrative functions into our existing office in columbus, ohio, closed a corporate office in new york, new york, and commenced the closure of our previous headquarters office in denver, colorado. all affected employees were either offered an opportunity to continue in the new organization or were offered a severance package. we expect to incur total corporate restructuring costs, including costs already incurred, aggregating approximately $48 million to $58 million including (i) employee severance and other employee transition costs of approximately $8 million to $10 million; (ii) recruitment and relocation costs of approximately $12 million to $14 million; (iii) lease termination and other office closure costs of approximately $17 million to $22 million; and (iv) third-party and other costs of approximately $11 million to $12 million. we recognized a total of $42.6 million of the foregoing costs during 2018, and expect to incur additional corporate restructuring costs into 2019 aggregating approximately $5 million to $15 million. for additional information, please see note 5. "corporate restructuring costs" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data" as well as "risks unique to our business strategy - our restructuring activities will increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention" in item 1a. "risk factors".
restaurant closures. in june 2018, we announced planned restaurant closures of approximately 55 to 65 restaurants beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and continuing over the next several quarters.  during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018, we closed or relocated 45 chipotle restaurants and five pizzeria locale restaurants in connection with this initiative. we expect to incur total restaurant exit costs, inclusive of costs already incurred, aggregating approximately $37 million to $43 million. we recognized restaurant exit costs of approximately $35.8 million during 2018, and expect to incur additional restaurant exit costs into 2019 aggregating approximately $1 million to $7 million. for additional information, please see note 6. "restaurant closure costs and impairment of long-lived assets" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data", as well as "risks unique to our business strategy - our restructuring activities will increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention" in item 1a. "risk factors".
restaurant development. for the full year 2018, we opened 137 new restaurants. we expect 2019 openings will be approximately 140 to 155 with a heavier weighting of openings towards the second half of the year.

the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2018 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed $237.4 million to the revenue increase, of which $112.1 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2018, and comparable restaurant sales increased $151.2 million. the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check, including a 4.0% benefit from menu price increases, partially offset by 0.8% fewer comparable restaurant transactions.
the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2017 were comparable restaurant sales increases and new restaurant openings. revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed $338.8 million to the revenue increase, of which $149.1 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2017, and comparable restaurant sales increased $233.2 million. the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check, including a 1.2% benefit from menu price increases.

food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases taken in select restaurants in 2017 and again at the end of 2018. food, beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from favorable avocado prices. these decreases were partially offset by increased freight costs, and to a lesser extent increased costs for tortillas and rice.
33
food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017. food, beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using pre-cut produce during portions of 2016, and cost savings initiatives resulting in lower prices and usage of paper and packaging products. these decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices.

labor costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 primarily due to an increase in wage inflation. the increase was partially offset by sales leverage as our revenues increased 8.7% in 2018, which included the benefit of menu price increases.
labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased during 2017 due primarily to increased crew efficiency, including the benefit of lower promotional activity during the year, improved manager deployment, and sales leverage, including the impact of menu price increases. the decrease was partially offset by wage inflation.

other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card processing fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 due primarily to sales leverage, including the benefit of menu price increases, and to a lesser extent marketing and promotional spend decreasing from 3.5% of revenue in 2017 to 2.9% of revenue in 2018. this is partially offset by increased costs associated with store repairs and maintenance, and delivery.
other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due primarily to decreased marketing and promotional spend, sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases, and decreased kitchen supplies expense. marketing and promotional spend decreased to 3.5% of revenue in 2017, as compared to 5.1% of revenue in 2016.

34
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2018, due to $32.1 million related to the corporate restructuring and other unusual charges, $21.4 million related to higher costs associated with our annual incentive cash bonus program and retention bonuses, $10.9 million associated with the biennial all managers' conference that was held in september 2018, $3.8 million in higher stock compensation expense, and the remaining increase primarily relates to general and administrative growth to support our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience. these increases were partially offset by the benefit of comparing against a non-recurring charge of $30.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017 related to the data security incident in the second quarter of 2017.
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2017, due to the liability of $30.0 million for the data security incident that occurred in 2017, increased bonus costs and higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $11.8 million. the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $10.5 million in legal expenses, and decreased meeting costs of $9.1 million primarily because of the biennial all managers conference held in september 2016. the increase in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 was primarily a result of a cumulative reduction of expense in 2016 for performance share awards that were no longer expected to vest.

depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2018 due primarily to accelerated depreciation on certain restaurant assets in connection with a large restaurant refresh project and from the restaurant closures described above under "2018 financial and operating highlights-restaurant closures."
depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due to sales leverage on a partially fixed-cost base.

impairment, closure costs, and asset disposals increased in dollar terms in 2018 primarily due to the planned closures of underperforming restaurants that began in the second quarter of 2018, offices affected by corporate restructuring, and the write down of a large portion of the associated long-lived asset values, which are discussed above under "2018 financial and operational highlights-corporate restructuring" and "-restaurant closures."
impairment, closure costs, and asset disposals during 2017 consisted primarily of charges related to the closure of underperforming chipotle restaurants and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment. this was a decrease from the prior year due to the closing of all shophouse restaurants in 2016.

effective tax rate                34.2%             36.1%             40.8%
the 2018 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2017 rate primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act that was enacted in december 2017 and federal tax credits offset by unfavorable tax impacts of expirations and cancellations of various equity awards.
35
the 2017 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, resulting in our recording a benefit for the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability, as well as from a lower state tax rate. the decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pre-tax operating income.

seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower, and net income has generally been lower, in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. for example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way, as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives. the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.
our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter, the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and anticipated and unanticipated events. new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance new restaurant construction, initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants, working capital, and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2018, we had a cash and cash equivalent and short-term investment balance of $676.8 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, to invest in, maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions, and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2018, there was $57.6 million remaining available under previously-announced stock repurchase authorizations approved by our board of directors. we announced $100 million in additional repurchase authorizations in february 2019. under the repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
we have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. in addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.

our total capital expenditures for 2018 were $287.4 million. in 2018, we spent on average about $0.9 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant, or about $0.8 million net of landlord reimbursements of $0.1 million. in 2019, we expect to incur about $300 million in total capital expenditures.  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to consist of investments in existing restaurants, including remodeling and similar improvements, and upgrading our second make lines and other restaurant equipment. we also expect about $130 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants, before any reductions for landlord reimbursements. for new restaurants to be opened in 2019, we anticipate average development costs will increase due to strategic initiatives planned in new restaurants such as a pickup lane and an upgraded second make line. finally, we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives.

(1)   see note 11. "leases" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."

(2)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. the majority of our purchase obligations relate to amounts owed for chicken, produce, and other ingredients and supplies, construction contractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.

the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. additionally, we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies, including the accrued liability related to the data security incident described elsewhere, due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment. see note 13. "commitments and contingencies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, healthcare costs, fuel, utility costs, and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level. additionally, many of our leases require us to pay property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases. there have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases. if we do raise menu prices in the future, general competitive pressures or negative consumer responses may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation.  critical accounting estimates we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. we believe that of our critical accounting estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity.

leases we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations. our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. we have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years.  we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term. in addition, tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions of rent expense over the reasonably assured lease term. the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term.  if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
we record a liability for lease termination costs consisting of the net present value of remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained, at the date we cease using a property, and measure fair value using level 3 inputs (unobservable inputs) based on a discounted cash flow method. any subsequent adjustments to that liability as a result of lease termination or changes in estimates of sublease income are recorded in the period incurred. if the estimate of sublease income was changed, our lease termination expenses could differ materially.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level, or in the case of a potential relocation or closure, at the restaurant level. we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market.
the fair value measurement for asset impairment is based on level 3 inputs. we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using a discounted cash flow projection model. in certain cases, management uses other market information, when available, to estimate the fair value of an asset. the impairment charges represent the excess of each asset's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. we make significant judgments to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations, historical performance, and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs, and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions. the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and market-based analyses to determine resale value. if our estimates or underlying assumptions, including discount rate, change in the future, our operating results may be materially impacted.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award's fair value. we use the black-scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or sosars, and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions. both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards, and sosars with performance-based vesting conditions, is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars. we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. certain awards that contain service, performance and market conditions have vesting criteria based on chipotle's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth, net income growth, and total shareholder return. our estimates of chipotle's future performance and the future performance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity. if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.
38
insurance liability we are self-insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers' compensation, general liability, employee health, property and auto damage. predetermined loss limits have been arranged with third party insurance companies to limit exposure to these claims. we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs.
reserves/contingencies for litigation and other matters we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. we record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.  although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability.  as a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
income taxes our provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items including impacts on effective tax rates, deferred tax items and valuation allowances based on our management's interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance. we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item. while we believe that our reserves are adequate, issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in the current and/or future periods.

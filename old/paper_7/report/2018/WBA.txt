investment in chinese pharmacy chain guoda
- 34 -
on december 6, 2017 the company announced that it had reached an agreement with china national accord medicines corporation ltd. to become an investor in its subsidiary sinopharm holding guoda drugstores co., ltd. ("guoda"), a leading retail pharmacy chain in china.
following a public tender process, the company's bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in guoda for approximately $416 million. on july 5, 2018, the company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
u.s. tax law changes the united states government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in december 2017. the u.s. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the company's fiscal 2018 and future results. among other things, the u.s. tax law changes reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. the u.s. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (gilti) regime.
in connection with the company's ongoing analysis of the impact of the u.s. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $125 million during fiscal 2018. this provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of $648 million from re-measuring the company's net u.s. deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by the company's accrual for the transition tax and other u.s. tax law changes of $523 million. as of august 31, 2018, while the company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the u.s. tax law changes, the final impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the u.s. department of the treasury and irs and actions the company may take.
in addition, the company's results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the u.s. tax law changes. the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective january 1, 2018, resulting in a u.s. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately $307 million.
exit and disposal activities store optimization program on october 24, 2017, the company's board of directors approved a plan to implement a program (the "store optimization program") to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the company's retail pharmacy usa segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from rite aid. the actions under the store optimization program commenced in march 2018 and are expected to take place over an 18 month period. the store optimization program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $325 million per year, compared to the company's previously stated expectation of $300 million, to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020.
the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. the company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. the company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures.
the company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap") of $100 million, which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. these charges included $19 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $81 million in employee severance and other exit costs.
store optimization program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with gaap. the company treats charges related to the store optimization program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
cost transformation program
- 35 -

the company completed the cost transformation program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. the company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2017 financial results in accordance with gaap of $1.8 billion. these charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. the company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. see note 3, exit and disposal activities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

walgreens boots alliance results of operations fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
fiscal 2018 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance increased 23.2 percent to $5.0 billion, while diluted net earnings per share increased 33.6 percent to $5.05 compared with the prior year. the increases primarily reflect the company's cost transformation program in prior year, operating performance and the gain on sale of the company's equity interest in premise health, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals and an impairment of the company's equity method investment in guangzhou pharmaceuticals corporation. diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.
other income for fiscal 2018 was $177 million compared to an expense of $11 million for fiscal 2017. other income for fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the company's equity interest premise health, partially offset by the impairment of the company's equity method investment in guangzhou pharmaceuticals corporation.
interest was a net expense of $616 million and $693 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
- 37 -
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 16.7% and 15.7%, respectively. the net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, partly offset by a provisional net tax benefit of $125 million as a result of u.s. tax law changes enacted in december 2017. in addition, the company's results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the u.s. tax law changes.
adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2018 increased 8.8 percent to $6.0 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2018 increased 18.0 percent to $6.02 compared with the prior year. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by 0.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2018 primarily reflect the impact of u.s. tax law changes and increased adjusted operating income. adjusted diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect rite aid related costs, the phasing of the company's cost transformation program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for the company's investment in amerisourcebergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate.
other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. in fiscal 2016, the change in fair value of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, the company recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for its investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the rite aid transaction.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between the company's financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. the mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by the cost transformation program and costs associated with the termination of the rite aid merger agreement, both of which reduced the company's u.s. pre-tax earnings. for fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the u.k. tax rate, adopting asu 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years.
adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from amerisourcebergen and a lower effective tax rate. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were $0.8 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) as of august 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 billion (including $1.8 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) at august 31, 2017. short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. to attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. investments are principally in u.s. treasury money market funds and aaa-rated money market funds.
the company's long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in its core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce those core strategies and meet return requirements and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. in june 2018, the company's board of directors reviewed and refined the company's dividend policy to set forth the company's current intention to increase its dividend each year.

the company believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. the company's cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.

see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. we use the following methods to determine our estimates:
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
- 52 -
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of the company's equity securities. this comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 11% to approximately 312%. the fair value of our boots reporting unit, within our retail pharmacy international division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 11%. we will continue to monitor the u.k. industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the boots reporting unit. see note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments - we use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.
we evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

pension and postretirement benefits - we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our non-u.s. employees. we also have a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. our pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. in determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $354 million to our pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $21 million.
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. our postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.
income taxes - we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

general during the fiscal year ended september 28, 2018, the following key factors contributed to our overall results of operations, financial position and cash flows:
•   net revenue increased to approximately $3,868.0 million, an increase of 6% as compared to the prior fiscal year. this increase in revenue was primarily driven by our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing radio frequency and analog content per device as smartphone models continue to evolve, increases in applications for the iot, and the expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including aerospace, automotive, industrial, medical and military.
25
•   our ending cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased 35.0% to $1,050.2 million in fiscal 2018 from $1,616.8 million in fiscal 2017. this was the result of a 13% decrease in cash from operations to $1,260.6 million in fiscal 2018 from $1,456.3 million in fiscal 2017 due to a $221.9 million increase in cash used for working capital. in addition, we returned $1,002.7 million to shareholders through repurchasing 7.7 million shares of our common stock for $759.5 million together with payments of $243.2 million in cash dividends. lastly, we invested approximately $422.3 million in capital expenditures and $404.0 million in payments for acquisitions.

we market and sell our products directly to oems of communications and electronics products, third-party original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components distributors. we generally experience seasonal peaks during the second half of the calendar year, primarily as a result of increased worldwide production of consumer electronics in anticipation of increased holiday sales, whereas our second and third fiscal quarter is typically lower and in line with seasonal industry trends.
the $216.6 million increase in revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and the $362.4 million increase in revenue in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 were primarily driven by our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing radio frequency and analog content per device as smartphones models continue to evolve, the increasing number of applications for the iot, and our expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including automotive, industrial, medical and military.

gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and share-based compensation expense) associated with product manufacturing. erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry. consistent with trends in the industry, we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline over time. as part of our normal course of business, we mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes, reduce material costs, improve manufacturing efficiencies, lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value-added products.
gross profit was $108.9 million higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher unit volumes, lower overall per-unit material and manufacturing costs, and favorable product mix, with an aggregate gross profit benefit of $267.1 million. these benefits were partially offset by the erosion of average selling price that negatively impacted gross profit by $158.2 million. gross profit margin remained consistent at 50.4% of net revenue for fiscal 2018.
gross profit was $176.6 million greater in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher unit volumes and lower overall per-unit material and manufacturing costs, with an aggregate gross profit benefit of $306.6 million. these benefits were partially offset by the erosion of average selling price and changes in product mix that combined to negatively impact gross profit by $130.0 million. as a result of these impacts, gross profit margin decreased to 50.4% of net revenue for fiscal 2017.

research and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs including share-based compensation expense, costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, masks, engineering prototypes and design tool costs.
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 is primarily related to increased headcount, overall employee-related compensation expense, and expenses associated with product development activity. research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue due to increased development complexity and our efforts to increase the value of our future products.
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily related to increased headcount, overall employee-related compensation expense, and expenses associated with product development activity. research and development expense increased slightly as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned factors.

selling, general and administrative expenses include legal and related costs, accounting, treasury, human resources, information systems, customer service, bad debt expense, sales commissions, share-based compensation expense, advertising, marketing, costs associated with business combinations completed or contemplated during the period and other costs.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily related to increases in employee-related compensation expenses, including share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the net gain related to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration of $11.9 million. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to the increase in net revenue.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to increases in employee-related compensation expenses, including share-based compensation, partially offset by lower legal expenses and the net gain related to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration of $1.3 million. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned factors and the increase in net revenue.

during fiscal 2018, $8.4 million and $18.3 million in amortization of intangibles were included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. during fiscal 2017, $27.6 million in amortization of intangibles was included in selling, general and administrative expense.
the decrease in amortization for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, primarily relates to fully amortized intangible assets that were acquired in prior years partially offset by additional intangible assets acquired during the fiscal year.

the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 of 31.1% was greater than the united states federal statutory rate of 24.6% primarily due to increases in tax from a one-time charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings of 16.9%, a one-time charge related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities of 1.4%, and income tax rate expense impact of 0.5% related to a change in our tax reserves, partially offset by benefits of 8.4% related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate, 1.0% related to a domestic production activities deduction, 1.9% related to stock windfall deductions, and 1.5% related to the recognition of federal research and development tax credits.
we operate under a tax holiday in singapore, which is effective through september 30, 2020. this tax holiday is conditioned upon our compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds in singapore. the impact of the tax holiday decreased the taxes we owe in singapore by $38.4 million and $37.4 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. this resulted in tax benefits of $0.21 and $0.20 of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
28
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 of 19.6% was less than the united states federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to benefits of 14.3% related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate, 1.6% related to a domestic production activities deduction, and 1.3% related to the recognition of federal research and development tax credits, partially offset by income tax rate expense impact of 1.0% related to a change in our tax reserves.

cash provided by operating activities:
cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. for fiscal 2018, we generated $1,260.6 million in cash from operations, a decrease of $195.7 million when compared to $1,456.3 million generated in fiscal 2017. the decrease in cash from operating activities during fiscal 2018 was primarily related to a $221.9 million increase in cash used for working capital. specifically, the increase in uses of cash were: $156.7 million in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer collections and $273.8 million related to accounts payable, due to the timing of capital expenditures and vendor payments. these increases in uses of cash were offset by increases in sources of cash of: $143.0 million related to changes in other current and long-term liabilities primarily related to the unpaid portion of the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
cash used in investing activities:
cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired, capital expenditures, purchased intangibles, cash received from the sale of capital assets, and cash related to the sale or maturity of investments. cash used in investing activities was $1,150.4 million during fiscal 2018, compared to $325.9 million during fiscal 2017. the cash used for capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 was $422.3 million, primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment to support the expansion of our assembly and test operations, filter production operations, and wafer fabrication facilities. during fiscal 2018, we paid $404.0 million, net of cash acquired, to complete an acquisition and $315.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities.
cash used in financing activities:
cash used in financing activities consists primarily of cash transactions related to equity. during fiscal 2018, we had net cash outflows of $993.7 million, compared to $597.4 million in fiscal 2017. the increase in cash used in financing activities primarily related to the increase in share repurchase activity and dividend payments during fiscal 2018. during fiscal 2018 we had the following significant uses of cash:
•   $759.5 million related to our repurchase of 7.7 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors on january 31, 2018, and january 17, 2017;
•   $243.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and
•   $48.0 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings upon vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
these uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $38.8 million and the proceeds from employee stock purchase plans of $18.2 million during fiscal 2018.
liquidity:
cash and cash equivalent balances were $733.3 million at september 28, 2018, representing a decrease of $883.5 million from september 29, 2017. the decrease resulted from $759.5 million used to repurchase 7.7 million shares of stock, $422.3 million in capital expenditures, $404.0 million related to business acquisition activity, $315.5 million in net purchases of marketable securities and $243.2 million in cash dividend payments during fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by $1,260.6 million in cash generated from operations. based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
29
on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the board of directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months. however, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. in addition, any future strategic investments and acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources. if we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.
our invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid marketable securities that are available to meet near-term cash requirements including: term deposits, certificate of deposits, money market funds, u.s. treasury securities, agency securities, other government securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper.
we had $300.6 million of cash and cash equivalents located in foreign jurisdictions at september 28, 2018.
off-balance sheet arrangements all significant contractual obligations are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulation s-k-303(a)(4)(ii).

(1)   other long-term liabilities primarily include our gross unrecognized tax benefits, as well as executive deferred compensation, which are both classified as beyond five years due to the uncertain nature of the liabilities.
(2)   contingent consideration related to business combinations is recorded at fair value and actual results could differ. see note 3 and note 5 to item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further detail.
(3)   other commitments consist of contractual license and royalty payments and other purchase obligations. see note 12 to item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenue; inventory valuation, which impacts the cost of goods sold and gross margin; assessment of goodwill and long-lived assets, which impacts the impairment of the respective assets; business combinations, which impacts the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities; share-based compensation, which impacts cost of goods sold and operating expenses; loss contingencies, which impacts operating expenses; and income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision. these policies and significant judgments involved are discussed further below. we have other significant accounting policies that do not generally require subjective estimates or judgments or would not have a material impact on our results of operations. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to item 8 on this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards board's ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 605 revenue recognition net of estimated reserves. our revenue reserves contain uncertainties
30
because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for product returns, price protection and stock rotation for products sold to certain electronic component distributors. our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements. refer to note 2 to item 8 on this annual report on form 10-k for information about the expected impact of our adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("topic 606").
inventory valuation. we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established on a quarterly basis and are based on a detailed analysis of aged material, forecasted demand in relation to on-hand inventory, salability of our inventory, general market conditions, and product life cycles. once reserves are established, write-downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory. our reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience, forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. changes in actual demand or market conditions could adversely impact our reserve calculations.
goodwill and long-lived assets. we evaluate goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangibles may not be recoverable.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to items such as: determination of the reporting unit and asset groupings, estimated control premiums, discount rates, future cash flows, the profitability of future business strategies and useful lives.
business combinations. we apply significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill recognized in business combinations. the value of all assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date using a market participant approach.
in measuring the fair value, we utilize a number of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. the valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions such as projected revenue, royalty rates, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates and estimated useful lives. these assessments can be significantly affected by our judgments.
share-based compensation. we have share-based compensation plans which include non-qualified stock options, restricted and performance share awards and units, as well as an employee stock purchase plan and other special share-based awards. note 10 of item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k details our current share-based compensation programs.
we determine the fair value of our share-based compensation items with pricing models as of the date of grant using a number of highly complex and subjective variables and assumptions including, but not limited to: our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, correlation coefficients, risk-free rate, the expected life of the award, dividend yield, and estimated performance against metrics. compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the underlying awards. management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates share-based compensation expense accordingly.
loss contingencies. we record an estimate for loss contingencies such as a legal proceeding or claims if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. we disclose material loss contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred.
our loss contingency analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to assess the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss.
income taxes. we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting.  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets.
the application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions.  tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings.  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due.  we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount
31
that we feel is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority.
other matters inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the three-year period ended september 28, 2018.

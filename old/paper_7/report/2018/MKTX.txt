item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future events and the future performance of marketaxess that are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results and timing of various events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, as more fully described in this section, in "item 1a. risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
executive overview marketaxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments using our patented trading technology. over 1,500 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are active users of our trading platform, accessing global liquidity in u.s. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, european bonds, u.s. agency bonds, municipal bonds, credit default swaps and other fixed-income securities. through our open trading protocols, we execute bond trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in an all-to-all anonymous trading environment in which we act as the matched principal counterparty. we also offer a number of trading-related products and services, including: composite+ pricing and other market data products to assist clients with trading decisions; auto-execution and other execution services for clients requiring specialized workflow solutions; connectivity solutions that facilitate straight-through processing; and technology services to optimize trading environments. through our trax® division, we also offer a range of pre- and post-trade services, including trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products.
our platform's innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics.  our traditional rfq model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. our open trading protocols complement our request-for-quote model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment. clients can use our auto-execution technology with both our traditional rfq and open trading protocols, thereby using rules-based execution to connect to diverse sources of liquidity while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors. our platform also provides our broker-dealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds.
we derive revenue from commissions for trades executed on our platform, information services, post-trade services and other revenues. our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses.
our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of information, trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. the key elements of our strategy are:
•   to use our broad network of over 1,500 active institutional investor and broker-dealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixed-income trading platform;

•   to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platform by deploying innovative technology solutions, such as our open trading protocols, to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platform and to address different trade sizes, bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences;

•   to continue to develop innovative next-generation technologies that will allow our clients to further automate and improve the performance of their trading desks through increased liquidity, enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market;

•   to expand and strengthen our existing service, data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle so that we are more fully integrated into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients; and

•   to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients.

critical factors affecting our industry and our company economic, political and market factors the global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. these factors include, among others, credit market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors' forecasts of future interest rates, economic and political conditions in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.
in 2018, our business faced a mix of trading environments that impacted our market share and trading volumes.  in the first quarter, the trading environment was generally supportive of our business due to a number of factors, including increased volatility resulting from the end of quantitative easing in the u.s. and europe, higher interest rates and a reduced trading emphasis on new bond issues in favor of the secondary markets in which we operate.  in the second and third quarters, however, overall trading conditions were less favorable as credit spreads narrowed, volatility declined and there was an increase in the issuance of new high-grade corporate bond issues. trading conditions improved considerably in september and the fourth quarter as credit spreads widened and credit spread volatility increased.  new issue activity was lighter than normal, and investment managers experienced significant outflows, resulting in increased secondary trading volumes. in addition, the increase in yields and flattening of the yield curve in 2018 resulted in lower duration of bonds traded on the platform, which negatively impacted our fee capture rate.
our results of operations are also impacted by the overall level of activity in our core products. in 2018, market volumes in the u.s. high-grade market increased 5% compared to 2017 driven by the increased market volatility, trade war tensions and the year-over-year decline of u.s. high-grade new issuance of 10%.  international demand for u.s. high-grade bonds also declined in 2018 as a result of an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs.  estimated secondary markets trading volumes for u.s. high-yield bonds, emerging market bonds and eurobonds, however, declined compared to 2017 as a slowing global economy lead to wider credit spreads and a greater emphasis on risk reduction.  as a result, secondary market liquidity was tighter, which contributed to the year-over-year market volume decline for these products.
competitive landscape the global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer or all-to-all trading platforms. competitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us.
in general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors, including, among others, the liquidity provided on our platform, the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform, total transaction costs and the quality and speed of execution. we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.
our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems. we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.
regulatory environment our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which could require us to incur significant costs.
following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry, governments and regulators in both the united states and europe called for increased regulation and transparency in the over-the-counter markets. as a result, the dodd-frank act was enacted in 2010 and, among other things, mandated the clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or sefs, in each case, subject to certain key exceptions.
45
various rules promulgated since the financial crisis have adversely affected our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients' ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities, which could negatively impact the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform. for example, while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us, the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates. in addition, enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the u.s. and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform.
since the presidential election in november 2016, however, the u.s. has pursued a path of financial deregulation and has rolled back certain provisions of the dodd-frank act. there has also been a growing focus on u.s. capital markets regulations as the u.s. department of the treasury issued a report with recommendations to improve corporate bond liquidity and the regulations that implement the volcker rule. in 2017, the sec established a fixed income market structure advisory committee in order to provide the sec with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the u.s. fixed-income markets, as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixed-income market structure.
in europe, mifid ii and mifir were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to: (i) enhance pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed-income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity, (ii) increase and enhance post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to an arm, (iii) ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and (iv) establish a consolidated tape for trade data. mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance, business and technology resources, incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and post-trade services businesses. while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined.
in march 2017, the u.k. notified the european council of its intention to leave the e.u. (commonly referred to as "brexit"). by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty, the u.k. is currently set to leave the e.u. in march 2019.  following brexit, our u.k. subsidiaries will not be able to rely on the existence of a "passporting" regime that allows immediate access to the single e.u. market. although current discussions between the u.k. and the e.u. regarding a transitional period following march 2019 envisage a temporary continuation of the existing passporting rights during such period, we have established new subsidiaries in the e.u. in order to provide our trading platform and certain post-trade services to clients in the e.u. following brexit.
rapid technological changes we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform. the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models. our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology.
trends in our business the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between and among our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients and monthly distribution fees. we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us:
•   the number of participants on our platform and their willingness to originate transactions through the platform;

•   the number of institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on the platform and the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses they provide on our platform;

•   the number of markets for which we make trading available to our clients;

•   the overall level of activity in these markets; and

•   the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed through the platform.

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus u.s. treasury securities. because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability.
46
commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded. under our disclosed trading transaction fee plans, bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions.
for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades.
u.s. high-grade corporate bond commissions. our u.s. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. under these fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer client. the u.s. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded. the average u.s. high-grade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform. distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans.
other credit commissions. other credit includes eurobonds, emerging markets bonds, high-yield bonds and municipal bonds. commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules. during the third quarter of 2017, we changed our high-yield fee plan structure. similar to our u.s. high-grade fee plans, certain dealers now participate in a high-yield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee, while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols.
liquid products commissions. liquid products includes u.s. agency, european government bonds and credit derivatives. commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules.
we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.
information services we generate revenue from data licensed to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. these revenues are either for subscription based services transferred over time or one-time services. revenues transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. information services are invoiced monthly, quarterly, or annually; when billed in advance, information services revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.
post-trade services we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and trade matching services. revenues are recognized in the period that the transactions are processed. when billed in advance, revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period.  we also generate revenue from one-time implementation fees which are recognized in the period the implementation is complete.
other revenue other revenue includes revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients.
expenses in the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses:
employee compensation and benefits. employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based compensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.
47
depreciation and amortization. we depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to seven years. we amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 15 years. intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
technology and communications. technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware, our internal network connections, data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers. the majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. we charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur.
professional and consulting fees. professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform, information and post-trade services products and other services.
occupancy. occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.
marketing and advertising. marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services. this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information and post-trade services.
clearing costs. clearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by third-party clearing brokers for the clearing and settlement of matched principal trades.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, board of directors' expenses, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and u.k. value-added taxes.
expenses may grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits, primarily due to additional headcount to support investment in new products and geographic expansion. see item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of our properties. however, we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure.
other income (expense)
investment income. investment income consists of income earned on our investments.
other, net. other, net consists of unrealized gains or losses on trading security investments, realized gains or losses on investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, investment advisory fees and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.

critical accounting policies and estimates this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, also referred to as u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. effective january 1, 2018, we adopted revenue from contracts with customers asu 2014-09 using the modified retrospective approach, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. there were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to those we disclosed in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10-k, as amended, for the year ended december 31, 2017.
use of estimates on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical. these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
software development costs we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software, including among other items, employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
revenue recognition for further discussion related to revenue recognition, see the preceding "trends in our business" section and note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date. these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. effective upon our adoption of asu 2016-09 on january 1, 2017, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" ("asu-2016-09"), we account for forfeitures as they occur. prior to the adoption of asu 2016-09, expected forfeitures were included in determining share-based compensation expense.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years. we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. effective upon our adoption of asu 2016-09, all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded through tax expense in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest. see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to income taxes.
49
business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives.
we operate as a single reporting unit. subsequent to an acquisition, goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit. as a result, all of the fair value of the company is available to support the value of goodwill. an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if circumstances change. intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 15 years. intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
segment results we operate an electronic multi-party platform for the trading of fixed-income securities and provide related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services, of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities. we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for certain geographic information about our business required by u.s. gaap.
results of operations year ended december 31, 2018 compared to year ended december 31, 2017
overview total revenues increased by $42.2 million or 10.7% to $435.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $393.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commission revenue of $35.6 million. a 2.7% change in the average foreign currency exchange rates of the british pound sterling compared to the u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2018 had the effect of increasing revenues by $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
total expenses increased by $29.2 million or 15.1% to $223.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $193.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher occupancy of $8.1 million, employee compensation and benefits of $6.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million, technology and communication expenses of $3.8 million, marketing and advertising of $2.4 million and professional and consulting fees of $2.2 million. the change in the average foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing expenses by $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
income before taxes increased by $16.3 million or 8.1% to $218.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $201.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. net income increased by $24.8 million or 16.7 % to $172.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $148.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

for volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars at average monthly rates. the 12.5% increase in our u.s. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share coupled with growth in estimated overall market volume. our estimated market share of total u.s. high-grade corporate bond volume increased to 18.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 16.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017. estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume increased by 5.2% to $5.1 trillion for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $4.9 trillion for the year ended december 31, 2017.
other credit volumes increased by 26.2% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to increases of 30.7% in eurobond volume, 26.7% in high-yield bond volume and 23.3% in emerging markets bond volume. our estimated market share of u.s. high-yield trace volume increased to 8.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 6.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017.

total u.s. high-grade average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $156 per million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $166 per million for the year ended december 31, 2017, mainly due to a decrease in the duration of bonds traded and the migration of certain of our broker-dealer clients from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee. other credit average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $201 per million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $242 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, mainly due to eurobond fee schedule reductions implemented effective january 1, 2018, a decrease in high-yield average variable fee per million as a result of the change in the structure of our high-yield fee plan options implemented in august 2017 and a larger percentage of trading volume in emerging market bonds that command lower fees per million.
distribution fees u.s. high-grade distribution fees increased $7.4 million principally due to the migration of certain of our broker-dealer clients from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee. the $13.9 million increase in other credit distribution fees principally relates to distribution fees under the high-yield fee plan structure implemented in august 2017 and a $3.1 million increase in unused monthly fee commitments.

information services. information services revenue increased $2.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase is attributable to revenue from new data contracts of $2.0 million and the positive impact of foreign exchange of $0.4 million.
post-trade services. post-trade services revenue increased $4.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 principally due to an increase of $3.7 million in trade publication services revenue and $1.2 million in regulatory transaction reporting services revenue, offset by a decrease of $1.1 million related to mifid ii implementation services and the positive impact of foreign exchange of $0.4 million. our transaction reporting business processed 0.9 billion transactions for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. revenue from new customers and services and changes in pricing plans more than offset the decline in revenue related to the decreased number of reported transactions.

provision for income tax. on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted into law. the tax act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. we recorded a provisional tax charge in 2017 of $11.7 million, composed of $6.7 million to re-measure u.s. deferred tax assets and $5.0 million for the repatriation tax on accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we reduced the provisional tax charge by $0.4 million as a result of new regulatory guidance and changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us.
our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 20.7%, compared to 26.6% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflected a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and other changes associated with the tax act and $5.6 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the year. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2017 included $26.1 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards offset by the provisional tax charge of $11.7 million related to the enactment of the tax act. our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on the geographic mix of our earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates and the amount and timing of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments, among other factors.
as of december 31, 2018, we had restricted u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.9 million. the utilization of our restricted u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation determined by section 382 of the internal revenue code. see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to income taxes.

for volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars at average monthly rates. the 12.9% increase in our u.s. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share coupled with growth in estimated overall market volume. our estimated market share of total u.s. high-grade corporate bond volume increased to 16.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 from 16.0% for the year ended december 31, 2016. estimated u.s. high-grade trace volume increased by 7.0% to $4.9 trillion for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $4.6 trillion for the year ended december 31, 2016.
other credit volumes increased by 14.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to a 37.2% increase in emerging markets bond volume offset by decreases of 5.3% in our high-yield bond volume and 4.8% in our eurobond volume.  liquid products volume (excluding credit derivatives) decreased by 25.2% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, due mainly to a 27.5% decrease in u.s. agencies bond market volume as reported by trace.

total u.s. high-grade average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $166 per million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $185 per million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the decline was mainly due to an increase in the number of larger sized trades, the migration of certain of our broker-dealer clients from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee and a decrease in the duration of bonds traded. other credit average variable transaction fee per million decreased to $242 per million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $256 per million from december 31, 2016, mainly due to a larger percentage of trading volume in emerging market bonds that command lower fees per million, as well as a decrease in high-yield average variable fee per million as a result of the change in the structure of our high-yield fee plan options implemented in august 2017.  the decrease in other credit average variable transaction fee per million was partially offset by an increase in eurobond fees per million as a result of the change in the structure of our eurobond fee plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.
distribution fees u.s. high-grade distribution fees increased $6.0 million principally due to the migration of certain of our broker-dealer clients from an all-variable fee plan to a plan that incorporates monthly a distribution fee. the $5.4 million increase in other credit distribution fees principally relates to a $8.2 million increase in distribution fees under the high-yield fee plan structure implemented in august 2017 that allows our broker-dealer clients to elect a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee. this was offset by a decline of $3.2 million relating to the change in the eurobond fee plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.
information services. information services revenue increased $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to higher data revenue.
post-trade services. post-trade services revenue increased $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to a $1.4 million increase in revenues associated with mifid ii implementation services which was offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in transaction reporting revenues. our transaction reporting business processed approximately 1.0 billion transactions for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to approximately 1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016.

quarterly results of operations our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of:
●   changes in trading volume due to market conditions, changes in the number of trading days in certain quarters, and seasonality effects caused by slow-downs in trading activity during certain periods;

●   changes in the number of broker-dealers and institutional investors using our trading platform, as well as variation in usage by existing clients;

●   expansion of the products we offer to our clients; and

●   variance in our expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits.

liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds. cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $486.4 million at december 31, 2018.
in october 2015, we entered into a two-year amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that increased our borrowing capacity to an aggregate of $100.0 million. in october 2017, we amended the credit agreement and extended the maturity date to october 2018. the amended credit agreement also provided for two additional one-year extension options and modified certain borrowing terms and covenants. in october 2018, we exercised our first option to extend the maturity date to october 2019. subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by an additional $50.0 million. as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.7 million in letters of credit outstanding and $98.3 million in available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement.
during the past three years, our cash flows were as follows:

cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to year ended december 31, 2017
the $55.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of $24.8 million, a decrease in net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of $17.9 million and a decrease in working capital of $14.5 million.
the $3.4 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of $22.0 million offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available-for-sale of $25.3 million. capital expenditures in 2018 included $25.1 million related to the build-out of our new headquarters in new york city.
the $24.4 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of $19.7 million and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of $17.3 million, offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of $13.5 million.
cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016
the $78.3 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of $57.1 million and an increase in net income of $21.9 million offset by an increase in working capital of $2.1 million.
the $0.5 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of $7.1 million offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available-for-sale of $7.1 million.
the $51.8 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of $22.5 million, an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $18.5 million and an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of $10.4 million.
past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business and financial condition.
non-gaap financial measures we use a non-gaap financial measure called "free cash flow". free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. we believe this non-gaap financial measure is important in gaining an understanding of our financial strength and cash flow generation.
the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, as defined, for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream. we may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our business. in the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders. any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business.
certain of our u.s. subsidiaries are registered as a broker-dealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc. these rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations, and also may require a significant part of the registrants' assets be kept in relatively liquid form. certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the u.k. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. as of december 31, 2018, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. as of december 31, 2018, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $162.8 million in excess of the required levels of $15.0 million.
each of our u.s. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity's principal regulator. as of december 31, 2018, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $93.3 million.
pursuant to the tax act, all previously undistributed earnings have now been subject to u.s. tax. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we consider our undistributed foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s. and do not expect to incur any significant additional taxes related to such amounts.
we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through third-party clearing brokers. settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. under securities clearing agreements with third party clearing brokers, we maintain collateral deposits with each clearing broker in the form of cash. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of the collateral deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction. pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty failure on any of our trades. we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to this right for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and general indemnifications. our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred. however, based on past experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be remote.
see item 5 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy.
effects of inflation because the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. however, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses, such as employee compensation, office leasing costs and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

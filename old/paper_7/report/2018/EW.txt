item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the three years ended december 31, 2018. also discussed is our financial position as of december 31, 2018. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
overview we are the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world's leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care. we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: united states, europe, japan, and rest of world. our products are categorized into the following main areas: transcatheter heart valve therapy ("thvt"), surgical heart valve therapy ("shvt"), and critical care. beginning in 2019, we will report our sales in four main areas: transcatheter aortic valve replacement, surgical structural heart, critical care, and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies ("tmtt"). going forward, tmtt will be reported as a separate product category to allow greater visibility into our performance in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies.

financial highlights our sales growth was led by our thvt products, primarily due to increased sales of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve across all regions, primarily the united states, and our critical care products, primarily the introduction of our hemosphere advanced monitoring platform in the united states. our 2018 shvt net sales in the united states decreased compared to 2017, primarily related to a $82.5 million sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves. our gross profit margin in 2018 and 2017 was positively impacted by an improved product mix, led by thvt products.
the increase in our net income in 2018 was primarily driven by the aforementioned operating performance, combined with tax benefits from a reduction in the u.s. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21% and the settlement of tax audits. this increase was partially offset by charges for a litigation settlement and impairment of intangible assets. the increase in our net income in 2017 was primarily driven by our increased sales and a gain from litigation related to the theft of trade secrets, partially offset by increased tax expenses associated with the tax cuts and jobs act.
healthcare environment, opportunities, and challenges the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. in 2018, we invested 16.7% of our net sales in research and development. the following is a summary of important developments during 2018:
•   we received ce mark for the sapien 3 ultra system for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients and we received fda approval for the sapien 3 ultra system for those patients who are determined to be at intermediate or greater risk of open-heart surgery;
•   we received ce mark for our self-expanding centera valve for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at high risk of open-heart surgery, and we initiated a pivotal trial in the united states to study centera for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at intermediate risk of open-heart surgery;
•   we received regulatory approval of our acumen hypotension prediction index in the united states. this technology leverages predictive analytics to alert clinicians of hypotension, or low blood pressure, before it occurs in their surgical patients;
•   we received ce mark for the edwards cardioband tricuspid valve reconstruction system for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation;
23
•   we received fda approval for the acumen suite of intelligent decision-support solutions for use on the hemosphere advanced monitoring platform; and
•   we reached an agreement with boston scientific corporation ("boston scientific") in january 2019 to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a one-time payment to boston scientific of $180.0 million.
we are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.

transcatheter heart valve therapy
2018 compared with 2017
the increase in net sales of thvt products was due primarily to:
•   higher sales of the edwards sapien 3 valve across all regions, particularly the united states and japan, driven by strong therapy adoption; and
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $20.0 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
2017 compared with 2016
the increase in net sales of thvt products in the united states was due primarily to:
•   the edwards sapien 3 valve, driven by strong therapy adoption.
the increase in international net sales of thvt products was due primarily to:
•   the edwards sapien 3 valve, due primarily to increased sales in japan, driven by its launch in march 2016, and europe, driven by strong therapy adoption;
partially offset by:
•   lower sales of the edwards sapien xt valve as customers converted to edwards sapien 3.
in february 2018, we received ce mark for our self-expanding centera valve for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at high risk of open-heart surgery. also, in april 2018, we received approval to initiate a united states pivotal trial to study centera for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at intermediate risk of open-heart surgery, and commenced the trial in october 2018. in april 2018, we received united states food and drug administration approval for a limited continued access protocol of our partner 3 trial for low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis in the united states, which we began enrolling late in the third quarter of 2018. also in april 2018, we received ce mark for the edwards cardioband tricuspid valve reconstruction system for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation. in november 2018, we received ce mark for the edwards sapien 3 ultra system, which features the sapien 3 ultra valve with a heightened outer skirt, and a delivery system that incorporates an on-balloon design that is compatible with the low-profile axela sheath. in december 2018, we received
25
fda approval for the edwards sapien 3 ultra system for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients who are determined to be at intermediate or greater risk of open-heart surgery.
surgical heart valve therapy
2018 compared with 2017
the decrease in net sales of shvt products was due primarily to:
•   sales return reserves in the united states related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves;
partially offset by:
•   increased sales of surgical aortic tissue valves in the united states and rest of world; and
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $9.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
2017 compared with 2016
the increase in net sales of shvt products was due primarily to:
•   surgical aortic tissue valves in europe and the united states, primarily due to increased sales of the edwards intuity elite valve system, and growth in our core products, partially offset by the continuing shift from our surgical aortic tissue valves to transcatheter aortic valves; and
•   mitral tissue valves, due to increased sales in rest of world, primarily china.
in september 2018, we began launching our inspiris resilia aortic valve in japan. the inspiris relilia valve is the first in a new class of resilient heart valves designed to be an option for active patients.
26
critical care
2018 compared with 2017
the increase in net sales of critical care products was driven by our hemosphere advanced monitoring platform, core hemodynamic products, and our enhanced recovery products, primarily in the united states. in addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales by $5.1 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
2017 compared with 2016
the increase in net sales of critical care products was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products and core hemodynamic products, primarily in the united states and rest of world.
during the first quarter of 2018, we received regulatory approval of our acumen hypotension prediction index in the united states. this technology leverages predictive analytics to alert clinicians of hypotension, or low blood pressure, before it occurs in their surgical patients. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we received fda approval of our acumen hypotension prediction index for use on the hemosphere platform.
27
gross profit the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by:
•   a 0.7 percentage point increase in the united states and a 0.2 percentage point increase in international markets due to an improved product mix, driven by thvt products;
partially offset by:
•   the impact of multiple investments in our operations, including an increase in costs to improve our manufacturing processes; and
•   a 0.2 percentage point decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts.
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by:
•   a 1.3 percentage point increase in the united states and a 0.3 percentage point increase in international markets due to an improved product mix, driven by thvt products;
partially offset by:
•   expenses associated with flooding from hurricane maria in puerto rico and the planned closure of our manufacturing plant in switzerland.
28
selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses the increase in sg&a expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states, europe and rest of world, mainly to support the thvt program, (2) higher personnel-related costs, and (3) the impact of foreign currency, which increased expenses by $10.6 million primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar. the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2018 was due primarily to the previously mentioned expense increases.
the increase in sg&a expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and europe, mainly to support the thvt program, and higher personnel-related costs. the decrease in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2017 was due primarily to leverage from our higher thvt sales in the united states and japan.
research and development ("r&d") expenses the increase in r&d expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including spending on clinical trials.
the increase in r&d expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs, including development expenses associated with the cardioband reconstruction system.
29
intellectual property litigation expenses (income), net we incurred intellectual property litigation expenses, including settlements and external legal costs, of $214.0 million, $39.2 million and $32.6 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in january 2019, we reached an agreement with boston scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a one-time payment to boston scientific of $180.0 million, which was included as an expense in 2018. the settlement covers alleged past damages and no further royalties will be owed by either party. in november 2017, we recorded a $112.5 million litigation gain related to the theft of trade secrets.
change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, net the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in income of $5.7 million, income of $9.9 million, and expense of $1.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the income in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to longer product development timelines, which reduced the probability of milestone achievements. these gains were net of expenses associated with changes in the fair value of the liabilities associated with the december 2017 acquisition of harpoon medical inc., the achievement by valtech cardio ltd. of a regulatory milestone, adjustments to discount rates, and accretion of interest due to the passage of time. for further information, see note 10 to the "consolidated financial statements."
special charges, net for information on special charges, see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements."
interest expense interest expense was $29.9 million, $23.2 million, and $19.2 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the increase in interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates. the increase in interest expense for 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a higher average debt balance, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
interest income interest income was $32.0 million, $20.3 million, and $10.8 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the increase in interest income for 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates.

the net foreign exchange (gains) losses relate primarily to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances, offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures.
the loss (gain) on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale money market and cost method investments.
the non-service cost components of net periodic pension benefit (credit) cost includes the costs of our defined benefit plans that are not attributed to services rendered by eligible employees during the year, such as interest costs, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of actuarial gains or losses. certain costs associated with realignments, including settlements

and curtailments, have been included as a component of "special (gains) charges, net." for further information, see notes 4 and 12 to the "consolidated financial statements."
in march 2016, we contributed $5.0 million to the edwards lifesciences foundation, a related-party not-for-profit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health- and community-focused charitable organizations. the contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment.

on december 22, 2017, public law 115-97, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 act"), was signed into law. the 2017 act (1) reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, (2) required companies to pay a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and (3) created new taxes on certain foreign earnings in future years.
on december 22, 2017, staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") was issued to address the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap") in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 act. in accordance with sab 118, as of december 31, 2017, we estimated provisional amounts for (1) $3.3 million of tax benefits in connection with the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities, (2) $297.4 million of net tax expense recorded in connection with the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, and (3) $32.3 million of tax benefits associated with a tax reform related restructuring. in accordance with sab 118, during 2018 we adjusted the provisional amounts as described below.
as a result of internal revenue service ("irs") guidance issued subsequent to the 2017 act, the $32.3 million of tax benefits associated with the tax reform related restructuring mentioned above were reversed. in addition, during 2018, we recorded a $12.8 million reduction in the repatriation tax and an additional benefit of $3.7 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. in accordance with sab 118, we completed our accounting for the 2017 act during the fourth quarter of 2018.
our effective tax rate for 2018 is lower than our effective tax rate for 2017 primarily because of the benefit from the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21% and tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits. in addition, the effective rate for 2017 included the one-time impact of the mandatory taxation of previously unrepatriated earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of tax-related balance sheet items due to the u.s. tax rate changes required by the 2017 act.

uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, gross uncertain tax positions were $150.7 million and $225.6 million, respectively. we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $42.7 million and $94.0 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. the net amounts of $108.0 million and $131.6 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):

the table above summarizes the gross amounts of uncertain tax positions without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such uncertain tax positions were settled.
we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. as of december 31, 2018, we had accrued $4.6 million (net of $1.9 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of december 31, 2017, we had accrued $7.4 million (net of $2.9 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. during 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized interest (benefit) expense, net of tax benefit, of $(2.8) million, $(7.3) million, and $4.0 million, respectively, in "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of operations.
we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
at december 31, 2018, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008. during 2018, we signed agreements with the irs to settle tax years 2009 through 2014 including transfer pricing matters and the tax treatment of a portion of a litigation settlement payment received in 2014. the irs began its examination of the 2015 and 2016 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2018.
during 2018, we executed an advance pricing agreement ("apa") between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters and we have updated our transfer pricing policies accordingly. certain intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2018 were not resolved and those related tax positions remain uncertain. these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, we executed other apas as follows: during 2017, an apa between the united states and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019, and during 2018, apas between japan and singapore as well as switzerland and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019.
based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
32
we have received tax incentives in certain non-u.s. tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024. the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were $144.9 million ($0.70 per diluted share), $81.0 million ($0.39 per diluted share), and $78.7 million ($0.32 per diluted share) for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
our dominican republic branch receives tax incentives, including an exemption from paying dominican republic income taxes, under a free trade zone law. effective november 9, 2012, the dominican republic enacted a law which, among other tax provisions, would apply a 10% withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a free trade zone company to its shareholder(s). the dominican republic withholding tax provision was, however, contingent upon certain future events. on october 5, 2016, the dominican republic ministry of finance published a notification confirming that the 10% withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by dominican republic free trade zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after october 5, 2016. the impact of this withholding tax has been reflected in our income tax provision.
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations. we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date. however, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
the 2017 act, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017, included extensive changes to the international tax regime. the 2017 act required a deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits. the deemed repatriation resulted in a $270.5 million tax obligation as of december 31, 2018. the one-time transition tax liability, as adjusted, is payable in seven remaining annual installments, as outlined in the contractual obligations table below. see note 16 to the "consolidated financial statements" for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
as of december 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the united states and outside the united states were $659.3 million and $297.2 million, respectively. during 2018, we repatriated cash and short-term investments of $1.4 billion. we assert that $1.1 billion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate $0.6 billion of our foreign earnings as of december 31, 2018.
certain of our business acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements. payment of additional consideration in the future may be required, contingent upon the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones, such as attaining specified revenue levels, or obtaining regulatory approvals. for further information, see note 7 to the "consolidated financial statements."
in april 2018, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement ("the credit agreement") which matures on april 28, 2023, and the previous five-year credit agreement was terminated. the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of$750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. subject to certain terms and conditions, we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate. as of december 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement. the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31, 2018.
in october 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the "2013 notes") due october 15, 2018. the 2013 notes were repaid in october 2018. in june 2018, we issued $600.0 million of 4.3% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the "2018 notes") due june 15, 2028. a portion of the proceeds from the 2018 notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our previous five-year credit agreement, and the remainder was used to partially repay the maturing 2013 notes and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2018, the total carrying value of our 2018 notes was $593.8 million. for further information on our debt, see note 9 to the "consolidated financial statements."
we reached an agreement with boston scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a one-time payment to boston scientific of $180.0 million, which was paid in january 2019.
from time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors. we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. during 2018, under the board
33
authorized repurchase programs, we repurchased a total of 5.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $784.3 million, and as of december 31, 2018, we had remaining authority to purchase $0.5 billion of our common stock. for further information, see note 13 to the "consolidated financial statements."
consolidated cash flows - for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016
net cash flows provided by operating activities of $926.8 million for 2018 decreased $73.9 million from 2017 due primarily to higher tax payments and a higher bonus payout in 2018 associated with 2017 performance, partially offset by improved operating performance in 2018 and higher working capital needs in 2017.
net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.0 billion for 2017 increased $296.3 million from 2016 due primarily to improved operating performance and receipt of a litigation payment, partially offset by higher working capital needs associated with growth in the business and the timing of tax payments.
net cash provided by investing activities of $76.7 million in 2018 consisted primarily of net proceeds from investments of $323.2 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $238.7 million.
net cash used in investing activities of $647.2 million in 2017 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $235.7 million, capital expenditures of $168.1 million, a $100.0 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of harpoon medical, inc., and an $81.9 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of valtech cardio ltd.
net cash used in investing activities of $211.7 million in 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $176.1 million and $41.3 million for the acquisition of intangible assets.
net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in 2018 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $795.5 million and net debt repayments of $437.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $147.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities of $473.2 million in 2017 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $763.3 million, partially offset by (1) net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $176.3 million and (2) proceeds from stock plans of $113.8 million.
net cash used in financing activities of $268.5 million in 2016 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $662.3 million, partially offset by (1) net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $222.1 million, (2) proceeds from stock plans of $103.3 million, and (3) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $64.3 million.

_______________________________________________________________________________
(a)   as of december 31, 2018, we had recorded $270.5 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act. the transition tax is due in eight annual installments, and the first annual installment was paid in 2018. the second annual installment is 8% of the total liability, net of a $16.1 million overpayment of 2017 federal income taxes. the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, 15% in fiscal year 2023, 20% in fiscal year 2024, and 25% in fiscal year 2025. see note 16 to the "consolidated financial statements" for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
(b)   the amount included in "less than 1 year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31, 2018 was $37.0 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment returns on plan assets. therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. see note 12 to the "consolidated financial statements" for further information.
(c)   as of december 31, 2018, the gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest, was $157.2 million and relates primarily to transfer pricing matters. during 2018, we executed an advance pricing agreement ("apa") between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters and we have updated our transfer pricing policies accordingly. certain intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2018 were not resolved and those related tax positions remain uncertain. these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations is uncertain. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
(d)   we acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, acquire businesses, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above. however, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial. we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to $585.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations are met. this amount includes certain milestone-based contingent obligations that may be paid through a combination of cash and issuance of common stock.
critical accounting policies and estimates our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the "consolidated financial statements." certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under gaap. in evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
35
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. we also use outside experts where appropriate. we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
revenue recognition when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms, sales rebates, discounts, and other incentives that we may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. the estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment. we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
in addition, in limited circumstances, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products, such as for next-generation product offerings. for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory. this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
excess and obsolete inventory the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory. we base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales. a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future. in addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
intangible assets and long-lived assets we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
ipr&d acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts
36
of an asset may not be recoverable. the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
contingent consideration we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:
•   timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals;
•   timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones; and
•   discount rates.
on a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings. changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events, or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax credits, net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the u.s. tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes. we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
for additional details on our income taxes, see note 2 and note 16 to the "consolidated financial statements."
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values. stock-based awards consist of stock options, service-based restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions. the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option valuation model. the fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. the black-scholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term. for performance-based restricted stock units, expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, which requires judgment. stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of
37
estimated forfeitures. judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted.
new accounting standards information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the "consolidated financial statements."

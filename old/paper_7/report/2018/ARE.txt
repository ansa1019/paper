2019 capital strategy during 2019, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. for further information, refer to the "projected results" section below within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k.
consistent with 2018, our capital strategy for 2019 includes the following elements:
•   allocate capital to class a properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters;
•   continue to improve our credit profile;
•   maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in ebitda, real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as sales of equity;
•   maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•   prudently ladder debt maturities;
•   reduce short-term variable-rate debt;
•   prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;
•   maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•   maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a properties, we expect to be able to debt fund a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. in addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and other debt and equity capital.
80
improved cost of capital as part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental ebitda. as our ebitda grows in 2019 and beyond, this growth in ebitda should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. additionally, the resulting improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of capital. in addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. for the year ended december 31, 2018, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 88%.
81
investments on january 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard that requires us, on a prospective basis, to present our equity investments at fair value whenever fair value (or nav) is readily available. for investments without readily available fair values, we adjust the cost basis whenever such investments have an observable price change. further adjustments are not made until another price change, if any, is observed. refer to note 7 - "investments" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

results of operations we present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results and provide context for the disclosures included in our annual report on form 10-k. we believe this tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to period. we also believe this tabular presentation will supplement an understanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of held for sale assets are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption charges are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments and impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment decisions and external market conditions. significant items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure, for current periods are described in further detail within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. items included in net income attributable to alexandria's common stockholders are as follows:

same properties rental operating expenses increased by $6.9 million, or 2.9%, to $244.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the $238.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to higher repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher utility expenses and snow removal services resulting from a comparably colder winter. the increase in same properties' rental operating expense was partially offset by property tax refunds during the year ended december 31, 2017.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased by $11.1 million, or 17.4%, to $75.0 million, compared to $63.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the continued growth in depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including a 28.1% increase in total rental revenue to $863.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $673.8 million for the same period in 2016, and a 5.1 million rsf, or 20.7%, increase in our north america asset base subsequent to january 1, 2017. accordingly, total assets as of december 31, 2017, increased by $1.7 billion, or 16.9%, to $12.1 billion from $10.4 billion as of december 31, 2016. as a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, were consistent at 0.6% for both periods.

we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases/redemptions of preferred stock, and payment of dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
97
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•   retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•   improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•   maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, preferred stock, and common stock;
•   maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•   maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•   maintain solid credit metrics;
•   maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•   mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;
•   maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•   fund preferred stock and common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•   manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; and
•   maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $272.1 million and $277.2 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; cash flows from operating activities; proceeds from real estate asset sales; non-real estate investment sales; borrowings under our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit; issuances of unsecured notes payable; and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, increased to $570.3 million, compared to $450.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. this increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since january 1, 2017, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2017.

the change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, is primarily due to an increased use of cash for property acquisitions and for investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments and an increase in return of capital from our unconsolidated real estate joint venture. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.

inflation as of december 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 95% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. an increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and secured construction loan.

the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under item 1a and within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
101
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $170.0 million to $210.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. for the year ending december 31, 2019, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed, along with contributions from same properties and recently acquired properties, to contribute significant increases in rental revenue, net operating income, and cash flows. we anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $42 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. refer to the "cash flows" section within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018.
debt in february 2018, s&p global ratings raised its credit outlook for our corporate credit rating to bbb/positive from bbb/stable. the positive outlook reflects s&p's belief that "there is further ratings upside over the next couple of years stemming from the company's high quality operating portfolio and projects under development, combined with a prudent financial policy."
in september 2018, moody's investors service upgraded our corporate issuer credit rating to baa1/stable from baa2/stable. the rating upgrade reflects the continued and significant improvement of our credit profile resulting from our diversified portfolio of life science properties in key markets with consistently high occupancy and high-quality tenants, many of which are less sensitive to economic cyclicality.
on september 28, 2018, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan to extend the maturity date of each to january 28, 2024, including two six-month extension options related to our unsecured senior line of credit. we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $634 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees associated with these amendments. the table below reflects the total commitments, outstanding balances, applicable margins, maturity dates, and facility fees for each of the following facilities as of as of december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
commitment     balance(1)   applicable rate   maturity date     facility fee unsecured senior line of credit   $2.2 billion   $208 million   l+0.825%          january 2024(2)   0.15%
unsecured senior bank term loan   $350 million   $350 million   l+0.90%           january 2024      n/a
(1)   excludes amortization of loan fees and amortization of premiums (discounts) as of december 31, 2018.
(2)   includes two six-month extension options that we control.
as of december 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan is $208.0 million and $347.4 million, respectively. borrowings under the $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan bear interest at libor or the base rate specified in the amended agreement plus, in either case, a specified margin (the "applicable margin") based on our existing credit ratings as set by certain rating agencies.
we use our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. borrowings under the $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a "eurocurrency rate," a "libor floating rate," or a "base rate" specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any case, the applicable margin. the eurocurrency rate specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the libor or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in a libor quoted currency (i.e., u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to canadian dollar bankers' acceptances for loans denominated in canadian dollars, (iii) the bank bill swap reference bid rate for loans denominated in australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-libor quoted currency (other than canadian or australian dollars). the libor floating rate means, for any day, one month libor, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in u.s. dollars. the base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its "prime rate," and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result
102
in an interest rate that is below the stated rate. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding.
we expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2019 from the issuance of unsecured senior notes payable and from borrowings under our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repaid the remaining $200.0 million balance under our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $189 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.
in july 2018, we repaid $150.0 million of the outstanding balance of our secured construction loan and reduced aggregate commitments to $200.0 million. in connection with the partial repayment of the secured construction loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $299 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.
in june 2018, we completed an offering of $900.0 million of unsecured senior notes for net proceeds of $891.4 million. the offering consisted of $450.0 million of 4.00% unsecured senior notes, payable on january 15, 2024, which will be used to fund certain eligible green development and redevelopment projects that have received or are expected to receive leed® gold or platinum certification, and $450.0 million of 4.70% unsecured senior notes, payable on july 1, 2030.
refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this report for additional information regarding our unsecured senior notes payable.
real estate dispositions and common equity we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a properties and/or development projects. for 2019, we expect real estate dispositions and issuances of common equity ranging from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, which includes the sale of a 60% interest in 75/125 binney street, a class a property located in our cambridge submarket for a sales price of $438.0 million. we expect to complete this partial interest sale during the first quarter of 2019. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold. in addition, the amount of common equity issued will be subject to market conditions.

other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.

104
uses of capital summary of capital expenditures our primary use of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 3.9 million rsf of new class a office/laboratory and tech office space, and intermediate-term and future value-creation projects supporting an aggregate of 6.8 million sf of ground-up development in north america. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to the "new class a development and redevelopment properties: 2019 deliveries" and "summary of capital expenditures" sections under item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, of $66.2 million and $58.2 million, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate. indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects which aggregated $32.5 million and $23.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our value creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre‐construction activities aggregating 11 projects with 2.6 million rsf in 2018 over 2017. pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $9.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
we also capitalize initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee's financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. costs that we capitalized relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not occurred. the initial direct costs capitalized also include the portion of our employees' total compensation and payroll-related benefits directly related to time spent performing the activities described above and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, our total leasing activity aggregated 4.7 million rsf with a weighted-average lease term of 9.1 years and 4.6 million rsf with a weighted-average lease term of 7.9 years, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $61.4 million, or $1.43 per rsf leased per year of the lease term, and $68.9 million, or $1.91 per rsf leased per year of the lease term, respectively, primarily consisting of third-party broker commissions.
the fasb has issued several lease asus that set out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leases, including the accounting for costs to execute leases effective january 1, 2019. as a result of changes in accounting rules, certain initial direct leasing costs will no longer be capitalizable. refer to the "lease accounting" subsection of the "recent accounting pronouncements" within note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

7.00% series d cumulative convertible preferred stock repurchases as of december 31, 2018, we had 2.6 million shares of our series d convertible preferred stock outstanding. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 402,000 shares of our series d convertible preferred stock at an aggregate price of $14.0 million, or $34.77 per share, and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $4.2 million.
in january 2019, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 275,000 shares of our series d convertible preferred stock for $9.2 million, or $33.60 per share, and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $2.6 million. as of january 2019, we have 2.3 million shares of our series d convertible preferred stock outstanding.
we may seek to repurchase additional shares of our series d convertible preferred stock in the future, subject to market conditions. to the extent that we repurchase shares of our series d convertible preferred stock, we expect to fund such amounts with the proceeds from issuances of our common stock, subject to market conditions.
6.45% series e cumulative redeemable preferred stock redemption in march 2017, we announced the redemption of our series e redeemable preferred stock. on april 14, 2017, we completed the redemption of all 5.2 million outstanding shares of our series e redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, or an aggregate $130.0 million, plus accrued dividends.

$385,839                  $321,750           $64,089
the increase in dividends paid on our common stock for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to january 1, 2017, as a result of issuances of common stock under our atm program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $3.66 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2018, from $3.38 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2017.
dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock for the year ended december 31, 2018, decreased slightly from the dividends paid for the year ended december 31, 2017, due to a decrease in number of shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 402,000 and 501,115 outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the decrease in dividends paid on our series e redeemable preferred stock was due to the redemption of all 5.2 million outstanding shares of our series e redeemable preferred stock on april 14, 2017.

estimated interest payments estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including estimated interest expense related to interest rate hedge agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate hedge agreements. refer to our interest rate hedge agreements in "contractual obligations and commitments" and "interest rate hedge agreements" in the "uses of capital" subsection of the "sources and uses of capital" section within this item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. the remaining 3% of our debt as of december 31, 2018, was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on libor. interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2018. for additional information regarding our debt, refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
interest rate hedge agreements we utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of our exposure to volatility in variable interest rates primarily associated with our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and variable-rate secured construction loan. our derivative instruments consisted of interest rate hedges.
our interest rate hedge agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is based on one-month libor. the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we have entered into master derivative agreements with our counterparties. these master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard international swaps and derivatives association, inc. form) define certain terms between us and each of our respective counterparties to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. in order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, these agreements are spread among various counterparties. the largest aggregate notional amount in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty in our interest rate hedge agreements existing as of december 31, 2018, was $150.0 million. if one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate libor-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. we have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge agreements.
ground lease obligations ground lease obligations as of december 31, 2018, included leases for 29 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total number of properties. excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of $8.8 million as of december 31, 2018, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 35 to 96 years, including extension options. refer to note 15 - "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our ground leases.
108
as of december 31, 2018, the remaining contractual payments under our ground and office lease agreements for which we are the lessee aggregated $587.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively. under the new lease asu effective on january 1, 2019, described in detail under the "lease accounting" subsection of the "recent accounting pronouncements" within section note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k, we are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under our ground and office lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. the lease liability will be measured based on the present value of the remaining lease payments. the right-of-use asset will be equal to the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease. on january 1, 2019, we recognized a lease liability of $218.7 million measured based on the present value of the lease payments aggregating $590.3 million remaining as of the initial application date of january 1, 2019, under our ground and office lease agreements for which we are the lessee.
commitments as of december 31, 2018, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $829.9 million. we expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. we may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. we have existing office space at 161 first street/50 rogers street in our alexandria center® at kendall square ("acks") campus that we are required to partially convert to multifamily residential space, pursuant to our entitlements for our acks campus. pursuant to these requirements, we expect to begin construction of the conversion to multifamily residential in 2019. in addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $9.2 million primarily related to construction projects.
in march 2018, we acquired a 10% interest in a real estate joint venture with uber technologies, inc. and the golden state warriors that owns 1655 and 1725 third street, located in our mission bay/soma submarket of san francisco. our total equity contribution commitment is $78.0 million, of which we have contributed $32.0 million through december 31, 2018.
in november 2017, we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer in the san francisco bay area to own a 49% interest in a real estate joint venture at menlo gateway in our greater stanford submarket of san francisco. our total equity contribution commitment is $269.0 million, of which we have contributed $177.7 million through december 31, 2018.
we are committed to funding approximately $248.3 million for all investments, which primarily consist of $247.8 million related to investments in limited partnerships. our funding commitments expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a weighted-average remaining period of 8.8 years.
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed. in addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

interest rate hedge agreements changes in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance relate to the change in fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements. we reclassify amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as we recognize interest expense related to the hedged variable-rate debt instrument.
foreign currency translation changes in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance relate to changes in the foreign exchange rates for our real estate investments in canada and asia. additionally, we reclassify unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses into net income as we dispose of these holdings.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
110
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a reit. however, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. if we lose our reit status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
investments in real estate recognition of real estate acquired we evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and needs to be accounted for as a business combination. an acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition.
for acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the acquisition consideration (excluding acquisition costs) to the assets acquired (including the intangible value of acquired above-market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including the intangible value of acquired below-market leases and other intangible liabilities), noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.
generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). the accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business combinations except that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a fair value basis. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. as a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. incremental and external direct acquisition costs (such as legal and third party expenses) are capitalized.
we exercise judgment to determine the key assumptions used to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired among its components. the allocation of the consideration to the various components of properties acquired during the year can have an effect on our net income due to the differing depreciable and amortizable lives of each component and the recognition of the related depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations. we apply judgment in utilizing available comparable market information to assess relative fair value. we assess the relative fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available comparable market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.
the value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an "as if vacant" basis. the value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. the value of above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities reflects the difference between (i) the contractual rents to be paid over the remaining term for each in-place lease and (ii) the estimated current market lease rates using available comparable market information and tenant credit quality. if there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate intangible factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in
111
order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. when we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. we also recognize the relative fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.
we completed the acquisition of 27 properties for a total purchase price of $1.2 billion during the year ended december 31, 2018. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed.
depreciation and amortization the values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of up to 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. the values of acquired above- and below-market leases are amortized over the terms of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market leases) or a decrease (for above-market leases) to rental revenue. the values of acquired above- and below-market ground leases are amortized over the terms of the related ground leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market ground leases) or a decrease (for above-market ground leases) to rental operating expense. the values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.
capitalized project costs we capitalize project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. capitalization of development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
properties classified as held for sale a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
if the disposal of the property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. the disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations.
impairment of long-lived assets on a quarterly basis, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our properties prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows for the properties, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
112
long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
we use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. the held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
equity investments we hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science and technology industries. as a reit, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.
our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies continue to be determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges and therefore generally requires no judgment to determine fair value. investments in privately held entities that report nav per share, such as our privately held investments in limited partnerships, are carried at fair value using nav as a practical expedient with changes in fair value recognized in net income. as a result, fair value estimation for these investments generally requires limited judgment. investments in privately held entities that do not report nav are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. for these transactions to be considered observable price changes, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold.
investments in privately held entities that do not report nav continue to be evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment. we monitor each of our investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, merger and acquisition activities, effect on an investee of changes in overall market conditions. if such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment's fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss, without consideration as to whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, in an amount equal to the investment's carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value. if there are no identified impairment indicators, we do not estimate the investment's fair value.
113
interest rate hedge agreements we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. we principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. we manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by entering into interest rate hedge agreements. specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the values of which are determined by interest rates. our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on libor. our objectives in using interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. all of our interest rate hedge agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. interest rate hedge agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company's making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate hedge agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate hedge agreements.
we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with borrowings based on libor. we classify our interest rate hedge agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. our interest rate hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge.
all of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. we formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. we make a quantitative assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement, and qualitatively on an ongoing basis, to determine whether these instruments are "highly effective" in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. the entire change in the fair value of our highly effective interest rate hedge agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if our interest rate hedges did not qualify as "highly effective," the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.
the fair value of each interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. these analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. the fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. the variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. the fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using "significant unobservable inputs," such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements.
recognition of rental revenue and tenant recoveries rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. we classify amounts currently recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. amounts received currently but recognized as revenue in future years are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits to our consolidated balance sheets. we commence recognition of rental revenue at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of, or controls the physical use, of the property.
114
rental revenue from direct financing leases is recognized over the respective lease terms using the effective interest rate method. at lease inception, we record an asset within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, which represents our net investment in the direct financing lease. this initial net investment is determined by aggregating the total future minimum lease payments attributable to the direct financing lease and the estimated residual value of the property less unearned income. over the lease term, the investment in the direct financing lease is reduced and rental income is recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the direct financing lease.
tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.
tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments and tenant recoveries. these tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year. we may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent arising from the straight-lining of rent. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, no allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent was deemed necessary. refer to the "revenue recognition" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
monitoring of tenant credit quality during the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.

non-gaap measures and definitions this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the nareit board of governors in its april 2002 white paper and related implementation guidance (the "nareit white paper"). the nareit white paper defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels, and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. the definition of funds from operations in the nareit white paper does not include adjustments related to unrealized gains and losses on non-real estate investments, which reflect market conditions outside of our control. consequently, unrealized gains and losses on non-real estate investments recognized in earnings are included in reported funds from operations as computed in accordance with the nareit white paper.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper excluding significant realized gains or losses on the sale of non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of non-depreciable real estate, impairments of non-real estate investments, deal costs, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.
in november 2018, nareit issued a restated white paper to incorporate its april 2002 white paper and subsequent guidance into a single comprehensive guide. we adopted prospectively nareit's restated white paper on january 1, 2019.

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, and impairments of real estate and land parcels. adjusted ebitda also excludes unrealized gains or losses, and significant realized gains and impairments, that result from our non-real estate investments. these non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our statement of operations outside of revenues.
we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. for example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, and significant impairments and significant gains on the sale of non-real estate investments allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real estate investment and disposition decisions. we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. adjusted ebitda has limitations as a measure of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net (loss) income or cash flows from
118
operations calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.
our calculation of adjusted ebitda margin, divides adjusted ebitda by our revenues, as adjusted. we believe that revenues, as adjusted provides a denominator for adjusted ebitda margin which is calculated on a basis more consistent with that of the adjusted ebitda numerator. specifically, revenues, as adjusted includes the same realized gains on, and impairments of, non-real estate investments that are included in the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda. we believe that the consistent application of results from our non-real estate investments to both the numerator and denominator of adjusted ebitda margins provide a more useful calculation for the comparison across periods.

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental amount, in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf. annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. annual rental revenue per rsf is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the rsf of our consolidated properties and our share of the rsf of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses are classified in tenant recoveries in our consolidated statements of operations.
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). see definition of fixed-charge coverage ratio for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.
class a properties and aaa locations class a properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction a key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new class a properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters. these projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory or tech office space. we generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new class a office/laboratory and tech office space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality class a properties.
pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.

fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. we believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).
the following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest and fixed charges (dollars in thousands):

fixed-charge coverage ratio:
- period annualized                        4.1x                        4.2x
- trailing 12 months                       4.2x                        4.1x initial stabilized yield (unlevered)
initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization and our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•   initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•   initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the 12 months ended december 31, 2018, as reported by bloomberg professional services. in addition, we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. material changes that cause a tenant's market capitalization to decline below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the 12-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.
121
joint venture financial information we present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our joint ventures, which are not presented in accordance with, or intended to be presented in accordance with, gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control, and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. for each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. refer to note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap.
net cash provided by operating activities after dividends net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.
net debt to adjusted ebitda and net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt to adjusted ebitda and net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda are non-gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as supplemental measures in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of net debt, as discussed above, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. refer to "adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin" within this section of this item 7 for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.
furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure for our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating the quotient of net operating income generated by a property on a straight-line basis and our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions and deterioration in market conditions. we also exclude investment income or loss calculated under a new asu effective january 1, 2018. investment income or loss represent changes in fair values of our equity

investments resulting from volatility of market conditions outside of our control. therefore, we do not consider investment income or loss to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute the number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. for operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to "annual rental revenue" herein.
same property comparisons as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total rental revenues, tenant recoveries, and rental operating expenses in our operating results can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. we separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the sec in our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. these same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
total market capitalization total market capitalization is equal to the sum of total equity market capitalization and total debt. total equity market capitalization is equal to the sum of outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock and common stock multiplied by the related closing price of each class of security at the end of each period presented.
unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding - diluted we enter into capital market transactions from time to time to fund acquisitions, fund construction of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. in march 2017 and january 2018, we entered into forward equity sales agreements to sell shares of our common stock. we are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. we also consider the effect of assumed conversion of our outstanding series d convertible preferred stock when determining potentially dilutive incremental shares to our common stock. when calculating the assumed conversion, we add back to net income or loss the dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock to the numerator and then include additional common shares assumed to have been issued (as displayed in the table below) to the denominator of the per share calculation. the effect of the assumed conversion is considered separately for our per share calculations of net income or loss; funds from operations, computed in accordance with the definition in the nareit white paper; and funds from operations, as adjusted. our series d convertible preferred stock is dilutive and assumed to be converted when annual basic eps, funds from operations, or funds from operations, as adjusted exceeds approximately $7.00 per share, subject to conversion ratio adjustments and the impact of repurchases of our 7.00% series d cumulative convertible preferred stock. the effect of the assumed conversion is included when it is dilutive on a per share basis. the dilutive effect to both numerator and denominator may result in a per share effect of less than a half cent, which would appear as zero in our per share calculation, even when the dilutive effect to the numerator alone appears in our reconciliation. refer to note 13 - "earnings per share" and note 16 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to our forward equity sales agreements and our series d convertible preferred stock.

the corporation conducts business through various u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries, including the northern trust company (the bank). the corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the bank in 1971. the corporation has a global presence with offices in 20 u.s. states and washington, d.c., and across 23 locations in canada, europe, the middle east and the asia-pacific region. except where the context requires otherwise, the terms "northern trust," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms refers to the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
financial overview net income in 2018 totaled $1.56 billion, up $357.4 million or 30%, from $1.20 billion in 2017. earnings per diluted common share totaled $6.64 in 2018 compared to $4.92 in 2017. return on average common equity improved to 16.2% in 2018 from 12.6% in 2017.
revenue increased 11% to $5.96 billion in 2018 from $5.38 billion in the prior year, driven by a 9% increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees, a 14% increase in net interest income, and a 46% increase in foreign exchange trading income, partially offset by a 19% decline in other operating income.
client assets under custody/administration (auc/a) and under custody, a component of auc/a, were each down 6%, as of december 31, 2018 as compared to december 31, 2017 levels. client assets under management were down 8% as of december 31, 2018 as compared to december 31, 2017 levels. as of december 31, 2018, auc/a decreased to $10.13 trillion from $10.72 trillion at december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, client assets under custody decreased to $7.59 trillion from $8.08 trillion, and included $4.70 trillion of global custody assets, down 5% from $4.94 trillion at december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, client assets under management decreased to $1.07 trillion from $1.16 trillion at december 31, 2017.
trust, investment and other servicing fees, which represent the largest component of total revenue, increased 9% to $3.75 billion, from $3.43 billion in 2017, primarily due to favorable markets, revenue associated with the acquisition and integration of ubs asset management's fund administration units in luxembourg and switzerland (the ubs acquisition), new business, a change in presentation of certain fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.
foreign exchange trading income of $307.2 million increased 46% from $209.9 million in 2017, primarily resulting from increased foreign exchange swap activity in treasury and higher volatility.
other operating income was $127.5 million in 2018, down 19% from $157.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to the impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, expenses related to existing swap agreements related to visa inc. class b common shares, and the net impact of various other operating income categories.
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (fte) basis in 2018 was $1.66 billion, an increase of $188.9 million, or 13%, from $1.48 billion in 2017, due to an increased net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.46% in 2018 from 1.33% in 2017, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates.
the provision for credit losses in 2018 was a credit of $14.5 million, reflecting reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. this was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio. the provision for credit losses in 2017 was a credit of $28.0 million, reflecting improvement in the credit quality of the corporation's loan portfolio and reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. loans and leases as of december 31, 2018 totaled $32.5 billion, down slightly from $32.6 billion in 2017. net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2018 were $1.1 million, down from $10.2 million in 2017. nonperforming assets as of december 31, 2018 were $117.7 million, a decline from $155.3 million in 2017.
noninterest expense totaled $4.02 billion in 2018, up $247.5 million, or 7%, from $3.77 billion in the prior year, reflecting increased compensation, outside services, equipment and software expense, and employee benefit expense, including higher third-party advisor costs due to a change in presentation resulting from the adoption of the new revenue
38 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recognition standard and higher expenses associated with the ubs acquisition, partially offset by lower severance and related charges. the prior year also included a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja).
the provision for income taxes in 2018 totaled $401.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 20.5%. the provision for income taxes in 2017 totaled $434.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.6%. the current year includes a net benefit to the tax provision primarily attributable to the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as adjustments recorded in the current year associated with the implementation of the tcja. also in 2018, the corporation recognized a tax benefit resulting from a change in accounting method regarding the timing of tax deductions for software-development related expenses. these decreases to the provision for income taxes in the current year were partially offset by tax accounting changes in 2018 brought about by the tcja including the tax accounting associated with additional non-deductible expenses and a reduction in the income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises.
northern trust continued to maintain a strong capital position during 2018, with all capital ratios exceeding those required for classification as "well-capitalized" under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. total stockholders' equity was $10.5 billion at year-end, up 3% from $10.2 billion in 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2018, northern trust increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.55 per share and repurchased 9.0 million shares of common stock, returning $1.36 billion in capital to common stockholders, compared to $895.6 million in 2017.
consolidated results of operations revenue northern trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.
revenue in 2018 was $5.96 billion, an increase of 11% from $5.38 billion in 2017. noninterest income represented 73% of total revenue in 2018 and 2017, and totaled $4.34 billion, up 10% from $3.95 billion in 2017.
the current-year increase in noninterest income primarily reflected higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and foreign exchange trading income, partially offset by lower other operating income. trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $3.75 billion in 2018, up $319.3 million, or 9%, from $3.43 billion in 2017, primarily due to favorable markets, revenue associated with the ubs acquisition, new business, a change in presentation of certain fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. foreign exchange trading income in 2018 totaled $307.2 million, up $97.3 million, or 46%, compared with $209.9 million in 2017, primarily resulting from increased foreign exchange swap activity in treasury and higher volatility. other operating income was $127.5 million in 2018, down 19% from $157.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to the impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, expenses related to existing swap agreements related to visa inc. class b common shares, and the net impact of various other operating income categories.
net interest income on an fte basis in 2018 was $1.66 billion, an increase of $188.9 million, or 13%, from $1.48 billion in 2017, due to an increased net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.46% in 2018 from 1.33% in 2017, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates. average earning assets increased $2.6 billion, or 2%, in 2018, primarily reflecting higher levels of securities, partially offset by a decrease in loans and leases and short-term interest bearing deposits.

trust, investment and other servicing fees trust, investment and other servicing fees were $3.75 billion in 2018 compared with $3.43 billion in 2017. trust, investment and other servicing fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed and serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. based on an analysis of historical trends and current asset and product mix, management estimates that a 10% rise or fall in overall equity markets would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in northern trust's trust, investment and other servicing fees of approximately 3% and in total revenue of approximately 2%. for a more detailed discussion of 2018 trust, investment and other servicing fees, refer to the "reporting segments and related information" section.

other income totaled $32.2 million in 2018, down $26.0 million or 44%, from $58.2 million in 2017, primarily due to the impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, expenses related to existing swap agreements related to visa inc. class b common shares, and the net impact of various other operating income categories.
investment security losses, net net investment security losses totaled $1.0 million and $1.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. losses in 2018 and 2017 include $0.5 million and $0.2 million of charges related to the other-than-temporary impairment (otti) of certain community reinvestment act (cra) eligible held-to-maturity securities, respectively.
noninterest income - 2017 compared with 2016
trust, investment and other servicing fees were $3.43 billion in 2017, up 10% from $3.11 billion in 2016, primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and revenue associated with the ubs acquisition. foreign exchange trading income decreased 11% to $209.9 million in 2017 from $236.6 million in 2016, primarily resulting from lower volatility and client volumes in 2017.
other operating income totaled $157.5 million in 2017, a decrease of 35% from $241.2 million in 2016. other operating income in 2016 included a gain on the sale of 1.1 million visa inc. class b common shares, net of a valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling $118.2 million, offset by impairment charges and a loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, as well as impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of $18.9 million.
net investment security losses totaled $1.6 million and $3.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. losses in 2017 and 2016 include $0.2 million and $3.7 million of charges related to the otti of certain cra eligible held-to-maturity securities, respectively.
net interest income net interest income stated on an fte basis is a non-generally-accepted-accounting-principle (gaap) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. when adjusted to an fte basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income. a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided on page 88.

net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. earning assets - including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal reserve and other central bank deposits, securities, and loans and leases - are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, and stockholders' equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. in addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.
net interest income in 2018 was $1.62 billion, up $193.5 million, or 14%, from $1.43 billion in 2017. net interest income on an fte basis for 2018 was $1.66 billion, an increase of $188.9 million, or 13%, from $1.48 billion in 2017, due to an increased net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets. average earning assets increased $2.6 billion, or 2%, to $113.7 billion in 2018 from $111.2 billion in 2017. the net interest margin in 2018 was 1.43%, up from 1.29% in 2017. the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2018 was 1.46%, up from 1.33% in 2017.
growth in average earning assets primarily reflected higher levels of securities, partially offset by reductions in loans and leases and interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks. securities, inclusive of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock and certain community development investments which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, averaged $50.3 billion, an increase of $5.6 billion, or 12%, from $44.7 billion in 2017. loans and leases averaged $32.0 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 5%, from $33.6 billion in 2017. interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged $6.0 billion in 2018, down $1.1 billion, or 16%, from $7.1 billion in 2017.
the increase in average earning assets was primarily funded by higher levels of short-term borrowings and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by reductions of demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits. average short-term borrowings increased $4.1 billion, or 61%, to $10.8 billion in 2018 from $6.7 billion in 2017. average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, to $74.6 billion in 2018 from $73.4 billion in 2017. average demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $2.6 billion, or 11%, to $20.5 billion in 2018 from $23.1 billion in 2017.
44 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations stockholders' equity averaged $10.2 billion in 2018, compared with $10.0 billion in 2017. the increase of $248.3 million, or 2%, was attributable to current-year earnings, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program and dividend declarations. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 31% to $0.55 per share and repurchased 9.0 million shares, returning $1.4 billion in capital to common stockholders, compared to $895.6 million in 2017.
under the corporation's 2018 capital plan, which was reviewed without objection by the federal reserve, the corporation may repurchase up to $529.5 million of common stock after december 31, 2018, through june 2019.

net interest income - 2017 compared with 2016
net interest income on an fte basis increased 17% to $1.48 billion in 2017 from $1.26 billion in 2016, reflecting higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. average earning assets increased $4.1 billion, or 4%, to $111.2 billion in 2017 from $107.0 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting higher levels of securities and short-term interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by reductions in loans and leases. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.33% in 2017 from 1.18% in 2016, primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates.
stockholders' equity averaged $10.0 billion in 2017, compared with $9.1 billion in 2016. the increase in 2017 was attributable to prior-year earnings, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program and dividend declarations.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit of $14.5 million in 2018 compared with a credit provision of $28.0 million in 2017, and a credit provision of $26.0 million in 2016. the current-year provision primarily reflected reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. this was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio. nonperforming assets at december 31, 2018 decreased 24% from the prior year-end. residential real estate, commercial, commercial real estate, and non-u.s. loans accounted for 87%, 6%, 6%, and 1% respectively, of nonperforming loans and leases at december 31, 2018. for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses for 2018, 2017, and 2016, refer to the "asset quality" section.
noninterest expense noninterest expense for 2018 totaled $4.02 billion, up $247.5 million, or 7%, from $3.77 billion in 2017, primarily reflecting increased compensation, outside services, equipment and software expense, and employee benefits expense. the current year included higher third-party advisor costs due to a change in presentation resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and higher expenses associated with the ubs acquisition, partially offset by lower severance-related charges. the prior year also included a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compensation, partially offset by lower severance-related charges and a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in the prior year in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act. the increase in salary expense was primarily driven by base pay adjustments. staff on a full-time equivalent basis totaled approximately 18,800 at december 31, 2018, up 4% from approximately 18,100 at december 31, 2017.
employee benefits employee benefits expense totaled $356.7 million in 2018, up $36.8 million, or 12%, from $319.9 million in 2017 reflecting higher retirement plan expenses, medical expenses, and payroll taxes, partially offset by lower severance-related charges.
outside services outside services expense totaled $739.4 million in 2018, up $71.0 million, or 11%, from $668.4 million in 2017, primarily reflecting a change in presentation of third-party advisor costs resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, increased costs associated with the ubs acquisition, higher technical services costs, increased restructuring charges, and higher subcustodian expense, partially offset by lower consulting services. there is a corresponding increase to trust, investment, and other servicing fees as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.

46 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations employee benefits expense totaled $319.9 million in 2017, up 9% from $293.3 million in 2016, reflecting increases in payroll taxes, medical expense, severance-related charges, expense associated with the ubs acquisition and payroll taxes on a one-time employee cash bonus recorded in 2017.
outside services expense totaled $668.4 million in 2017, up 7% from $627.1 million in 2016, reflecting an increase in technical services, subcustodian expense, expense associated with the ubs acquisition, and severance-related charges.
equipment and software expense increased 12% to $524.0 million in 2017 compared to $467.4 million in 2016, reflecting increased software amortization, software support costs, computer maintenance and rental costs, and expense associated with the ubs acquisition.
occupancy expense for 2017 was $191.8 million, up 8% from $177.4 million in 2016, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation expense related to a previously-announced facility exit, higher rent expense, and higher costs associated with the ubs acquisition.
other operating expense totaled $331.6 million in 2017, down 9% from $364.4 million in 2016, primarily due to charges recorded in 2016 relating to certain securities lending litigation and contractual modifications associated with existing c&is clients, partially offset by increases in expense in 2017 related to higher business promotion expense driven by increased costs associated with the northern trust-sponsored pga tour golf tournament, and higher charges associated with account servicing activities, supplemental compensation plans, and costs associated with the ubs acquisition.
provision for income taxes provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pre-tax income as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws. the 2018 provision for income taxes was $401.4 million, representing an effective rate of 20.5%. this compares with a provision for income taxes of $434.9 million and an effective rate of 26.6% in 2017.
the current year includes tax benefits primarily attributable to the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, a tax benefit recognized in 2018 resulting from a change in accounting method regarding the timing of tax deductions for software-related expenses, and adjustments recorded in the current year associated with the implementation of the tcja as outlined below. these decreases to the provision for income taxes in the current year were partially offset by the impact of an increase in income before income taxes, tax accounting changes in 2018 brought about by the tcja including the tax accounting associated with additional non-deductible expenses, and a reduction in the income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises. also included in the 2017 tax provision were federal and state research tax credits related to the corporation's technology spend between 2013 and 2016.
the tcja was enacted on december 22, 2017, and reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. it also required companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. at december 31, 2017, northern trust made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the tcja. during 2018, northern trust completed the related calculations and additional analyses associated with the implementation of the tcja, resulting in a number of adjustments to the 2018 tax provision as follows:

impact related to federal deferred taxes              12.7          (210.0   )
other adjustments                                     (0.7   )         6.9
provision (benefit) for income taxes                 $(4.8   )      $(53.1   )
adjustments in the above table include a tax benefit of $16.8 million resulting from an adjustment to the corporation's 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-us subsidiaries, offset by a $12.7 million net provision associated with the repricing of deferred taxes.
the income tax provision of $434.9 million for 2017 represented an effective tax rate of 26.6%, and reflects reductions totaling $50.0 million related to certain non-u.s. subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states. as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, these earnings and the earnings from prior years which have been reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states are deemed to have been repatriated to the united states and subject to a repatriation tax. as of december 31, 2018, northern trust's repatriation tax has been estimated to be $133.2 million.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the 2016 income tax provision of $484.6 million represented an effective tax rate of 31.9%, and reflects reductions of $50.1 million related to certain non-u.s. subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside the united states.
reporting segments and related information northern trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: c&is and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to c&is and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business. the revenue and expenses of asset management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to c&is and wealth management. income and expense associated with the corporation's and the bank's wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation, and certain nonrecurring items are not allocated to c&is and wealth management, and are reported in northern trust's third reporting segment, treasury and other, in the following pages.
c&is and wealth management results are presented to promote a greater understanding of their financial performance. the information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is derived from internal accounting systems that support northern trust's strategic objectives and management structure. management has developed accounting systems to allocate revenue and expense related to each segment. these systems incorporate processes for allocating assets, liabilities and equity, and the applicable interest income and expense. equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. northern trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.

the 47% increase in c&is net income in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily resulted from higher net interest income, trust, investment and other servicing fees, foreign exchange trading income, and a lower provision for income taxes, partially offset by higher noninterest expense including expenses associated with the ubs acquisition. the 24% increase in c&is net income in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, net interest income, and other noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense, including expenses associated with the ubs acquisition, and lower foreign exchange trading income.
c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. the fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period.
securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. the other services fee category in c&is includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.
provided below are the components of c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees.

$176.1 million increased $29.1 million, or 20%, from $147.0 million in 2016 primarily due to impairment charges and loss on sales related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loans and leases portfolio in 2016.
c&is net interest income net interest income on an fte basis increased $258.4 million, or 35%, in 2018 to $992.2 million from $733.8 million in 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin and average earning assets. net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.29% from 0.99%, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and a mix shift in earning assets. average earning assets totaled $76.9 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 3%, from $74.3 billion in the prior year. the earning assets in c&is consisted primarily of intercompany assets and loans and leases. funding sources were primarily comprised of non-u.s. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $58.0 billion in 2018, up from $53.8 billion in 2017. net interest income on an fte basis increased $168.8 million or 30%, in 2017 to $733.8 million from $565.0 million in 2016, primarily attributable to increases in the net interest margin and average earning assets.

c&is noninterest expense total c&is noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $2.42 billion in 2018, an increase of $226.9 million, or 10%, from $2.19 billion in 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, indirect expense allocations, outside services, other operating expense, and employee benefits expense, all including the impact of higher noninterest expense associated with the ubs acquisition. noninterest expense for 2017 increased $182.3 million, or 9%, from $2.01 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher indirect expense allocations, compensation expense, severance-related charges, higher expense associated with the ubs acquisition, and higher outside services expense, partially offset by lower other operating expenses.

wealth management other noninterest income other noninterest income for 2018 totaled $102.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 1%, from $103.9 million in 2017, due to decreases in treasury management fees. other noninterest income in 2017 decreased $1.8 million, or 2%, as compared to 2016, primarily reflecting decreases in banking fees and credit-related service charges.
wealth management net interest income net interest income on an fte basis was $816.5 million for 2018, up $80.3 million, or 11%, from $736.2 million in 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin, partially offset by a decline in earning assets. net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 3.16% from 2.80%, reflecting higher yields on earning assets. average earning assets totaled $25.9 billion in 2018, down $469.9 million, or 2%, in the current year from $26.3 billion in 2017. net interest income on an fte basis in 2017 increased $84.8 million, or 13%, from 2016 and the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2017 of 2.80% increased from the 2016 net interest margin of 2.48%. the higher net interest margin in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher yields on earning assets. earning assets and funding sources in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits, respectively.
wealth management provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit of $16.4 million for 2018, compared to a credit of $31.4 million in 2017, and a credit of $27.9 million in 2016. the 2018 provision credit was primarily driven by improved credit quality and reductions in outstanding loans, standby letters of credit, and undrawn commitments, which resulted in a reduction of the inherent allowance. the 2017 provision credit was primarily driven by improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by charge-offs. the 2016 provision credit was primarily driven by improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate and private client portfolios.

treasury and other noninterest income in 2018 was $60.5 million compared to $30.8 million in 2017. the increase primarily reflects an increase in foreign exchange trading income, a component of other noninterest income, due to higher foreign exchange swap activity in treasury and increased market volatility, partially offset by decreases in various other operating income categories.
treasury and other net interest income on an fte basis in 2018 was a loss of $144.8 million, down $149.8 million from $5.0 million in 2017. the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin. net interest income on an fte basis in 2017 decreased $38.6 million, or 89%, to $5.0 million from $43.6 million in 2016. the decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin and lower levels of earning assets.
treasury and other noninterest expense in 2018 equaled $135.5 million, down $34.1 million, or 20%, from $169.6 million in 2017. the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in indirect expense allocations to c&is and wealth management and lower compensation expense, partially offset by higher general overhead costs, including equipment and software expense and outside services expense.
the benefit from income taxes was $74.8 million in 2018, down from $146.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, the higher net benefit recorded in the prior year attributable to the tax cuts and jobs act of $53.1 million compared to the current year net benefit of $4.8 million, a tax benefit recognized in 2018 resulting from a change in accounting method regarding the timing of tax deductions for software-related expenses of $24.4 million, federal and state research tax credits of $17.6 million recorded in the prior year related to the corporation's technology spend between 2013 and 2016, and a reduction in the income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower income before income taxes.

commercial real estate in managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower's principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to investors well known to northern trust. underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required.
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 59
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. these loans are primarily located in the california, illinois, florida, texas, and arizona markets. construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion.

the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component).

specific component of the allowance: the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay.
at december 31, 2018, the specific allowance component amounted to $10.0 million compared with $5.4 million at the end of 2017. the $4.6 million increase is primarily attributable to outstanding loans and standby letters of credit in the residential real estate and commercial and institutional portfolios, respectively.
the increase in the specific component of the allowance from $2.1 million in 2016 to $5.4 million in 2017 was primarily attributable to additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans, partially offset by charge-offs and pay-offs.
inherent component of the allowance: the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. to estimate the allowance for credit losses on
62 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans.
the inherent portion of the allowance decreased $20.2 million to $128.2 million at december 31, 2018, compared with $148.4 million at december 31, 2017, which decreased $41.5 million from $189.9 million at december 31, 2016.
the decrease in 2018 was primarily driven by reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. the decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios.
overall allowance: the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of $138.2 million at december 31, 2018, compared with $153.8 million at the end of 2017. the allowance of $112.6 million assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was 0.35% at december 31, 2018, down from a $131.2 million allowance assigned to loans and leases, representing 0.40% of total loans and leases at december 31, 2017. allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $25.6 million and $22.6 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
provision: the provision for credit losses was a credit of $14.5 million and net charge-offs totaled $1.1 million in 2018. this compares with a credit provision of $28.0 million and net charge-offs of $10.2 million in 2017, and a $26.0 million credit provision and net charge-offs of $15.2 million in 2016.
impaired loans a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor's financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. as of december 31, 2018, impaired loans totaled $116.2 million and included $99.8 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of $139.8 million at december 31, 2017, which included $98.4 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. impaired loans had $7.2 million and $5.4 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31, 2018, and december 31, 2017, respectively. impaired loans are measured based upon the loan's market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of december 31, 2018) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates. the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust's future financial condition and results of operations.
for northern trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors (audit committee).
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. the loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. in determining an appropriate allowance level, northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures.
the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 63
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations specific allowance: the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay. for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management's judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.
inherent allowance: the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio. the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments. for each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. in determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management, the reporting segments and corporate finance.
the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. in addition to northern trust's own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate.
loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management's assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. the provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs.
management's estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2018 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. however, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
pension plan accounting northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees (the qualified plan) and a u.s. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (the nonqualified plan). certain european-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarially-based projections relating to the plans. due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. as a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders' equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.
64 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans' actuaries. in addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.
in determining the pension expense for the u.s. plans in 2018, northern trust utilized a discount rate of 3.79% for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan. the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 4.39%. the expected long-term rate of return on qualified plan assets was 6.00%.
in evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the u.s. plans as of northern trust's december 31, 2018 measurement date, the following were considered:
•   discount rate: northern trust estimates the discount rate for its u.s. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the aon aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date. this yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aa-rated corporate bonds. this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 4.47% at december 31, 2018 for the qualified and nonqualified plans, an increase from 3.79% at december 31, 2017.
•   compensation level: based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption continues to be based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 4.39%.
•   rate of return on plan assets: the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. as a result of these analyses, northern trust's rate of return assumption for the qualified plan remains at 6.00% for 2019.
•   mortality table: northern trust uses the aggregate rp-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2014 to 2006. northern trust's pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale mp-2018, released by the society of actuaries in october 2018. this assumption was updated at december 31, 2018 from improvement scale mp-2017. the updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the mp-2017 improvement scale. mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2019.
annual net pension expense in 2019 is expected to decrease by approximately $8.2 million, primarily driven by the increase in discount rate.
in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected u.s plans' periodic pension expense in 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2018, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.

2006. there were no contributions to the qualified plan in 2018 plan year. northern trust contributed $50.0 million to the qualified plan at the beginning of 2018, retrospectively for the 2017 plan year. the minimum required contribution to the qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2019. the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at $270 million for 2019.
fair value measurements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 29% of northern trust's total assets and less than 1% of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (level 3). approximately 14% of northern trust's assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1. northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.
approximately 86% of northern trust's assets and 94% of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. investment debt securities classified as available for sale make up 96% of level 2 assets with the remaining 4% primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments.
northern trust's level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. northern trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
as of december 31, 2018, all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below, were classified as level 2 and approximately 96%, measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material.
as of december 31, 2018, northern trust's level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 1.1 million and 1.0 million shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015, respectively. pursuant to the swaps, northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc. class a common stock (visa class a common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest. the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust's own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price. see "visa class b common shares" under note 25, "contingent liabilities," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)" (asu 2016-02). asu 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet, with certain specified scope exceptions. specifically within the lessee model under asu 2016-02, a lessee is required to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make future lease payments, known as the lease liability, and a right-of-use asset

(rou asset) representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. northern trust has established a complete inventory of leases and has formalized the future operating model for lease accounting and related internal controls. asu 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, with certain practical expedients available. northern trust adopted asu 2016-02 as of january 1, 2019, the date of initial application, and in doing so does not expect to restate comparative periods for the effects of applying asu 2016-02. northern trust elected the package of practical expedients available under asu 2016-02, which allows northern trust to forego a reassessment of (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases. as a result of the adoption of asu 2016-02, northern trust will recognize operating lease liabilities of approximately $530 million, with corresponding rou assets of approximately $480 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under accounting standards codification 840 - leases, and adjustments to the rou assets for deferred rent required under asu 2016-02. the adoption of asu 2016-02 will not impact significantly northern trust's consolidated results of operations.
in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments" (asu 2016-13). asu 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. the main provisions of asu 2016-13 include (1) replacing the "incurred loss" approach under current gaap with an "expected loss" model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current gaap, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. asu 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted.
northern trust has established a working group across various functions, an overall governance structure, and has finalized a detailed project plan for its implementation efforts. further, northern trust is finalizing the development activities for its credit models, focusing initially on its securities credit models. northern trust's internal model validation group has started the review and validation process for these credit models. in addition, northern trust assessed the new disclosure requirements and evaluated the availability of required new data elements, and is in the process of drafting disclosures required under asu 2016-13. northern trust continues to evaluate specific application issues and the overall impact of the adoption of asu 2016-13.
in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-13, "fair value measurement (topic 820): disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement" (asu 2018-13). the primary objective of asu 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. asu 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. the adoption of asu 2018-13 will not impact significantly northern trust's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-15, "intangibles - goodwill and other - internal - use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force)" (asu 2018-15). asu 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). asu 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted. asu 2018-15 is not expected to impact significantly northern trust's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
in october 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-16, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) overnight index swap (ois) rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes" (asu 2018-16). asu 2018-16 permits use of the ois rate based on sofr as a u.s. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under topic 815. asu 2018-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted. asu 2018-16 is not expected to impact significantly northern trust's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
in october 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-17, "consolidation (topic 810): targeted improvements to related party guidance for variable interest entities" (asu 2018-17). asu 2018-17 requires that indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements should be considered on a proportional basis (rather than as the equivalent of a direct interest in its entirety) for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests. asu 2018-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted. asu 2018-17 is not expected to impact significantly northern trust's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

standby letters of credit obligate northern trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. these instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. northern trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. standby letters of credit of $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, include $72.3 million and $92.5 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others. the weighted average maturity of standby letters of credit was 23 months at december 31, 2018 and 24 months at december 31, 2017.
as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, northern trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the northern trust capital markets credit committee. in connection with these activities, northern trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower's failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. as securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. the collateral is revalued on a daily basis. the amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was $128.9 billion and $143.6 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. because of the credit quality of the
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 69
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations borrowers and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at december 31, 2018, or 2017 related to these indemnifications.
additional information about northern trust's off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in note 28, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
variable interest entities variable interest entities (vies) are defined within gaap as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vie's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie.
leveraged leases. in leveraged leasing transactions, northern trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20-30% of the asset's cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 70-80% provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. in such transactions, the trusts, which are vies, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. the lessee's maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. as a result, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the leveraged lease trust vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the leveraged lease trust vies.
tax credit structures. northern trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. the community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which northern trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. the economic performance of the community development projects, some of which are vies, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development project vies as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the community development project vies.
investment funds. northern trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of northern trust are investors. as an asset manager of funds, northern trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund's investment objective. based on its analysis, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies under gaap.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as the corporation's principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust's banking activities, the bank centrally manages liquidity for all u.s. and international banking operations. liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the c&is and wealth management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, federal home loan bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2018, the bank had over $38.6 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. the bank also is active in the u.s. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit.
70 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 68% of total assets as of december 31, 2018. the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank, which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window, totaled $47.3 billion at december 31, 2018. the corporation and the bank each satisfied the u.s. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2018.
the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank. the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the bank, and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. on august 3, 2018, the corporation issued $500 million of 3.650% senior notes, due august 3, 2028. the corporation also received $1.2 billion of dividends from the bank in 2018. dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in note 31, "restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
the corporation's uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation's stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2018 were $924.3 million of common stock repurchases and $405.4 million of common stock dividends.
the corporation's liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $866.8 million and $1.0 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. during, and at year-end, 2018 and 2017, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. average liquidity during 2018 and 2017 was $887.0 million and $750.5 million, respectively. the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 34, "northern trust corporation (corporation only)," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31, 2018, provided below, allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.

2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 71
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion, primarily reflecting period earnings and the impact of other operating activities and non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, was $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting earnings and the impact of non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by other operating activities.
net cash provided by investing activities was $4.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily reflecting decreased levels of deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks and lower interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by net purchases of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity and the net change in other investing activities.
net cash used in investing activities was $14.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks as well as net purchases of debt securities held to maturity.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities totaled $5.8 billion, primarily reflecting decreased levels of total deposits, the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program, lower securities sold under agreements to repurchase, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, and repayments of the 6.50% subordinated notes previously issued by the bank and due august 2018, partially offset by higher short-term other borrowings and the proceeds from the issuance by the corporation of 3.65% senior notes. the decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of non-interest bearing domestic and non-u.s. office client deposits and lower domestic interest-bearing client deposits.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $11.3 billion, primarily reflecting higher levels of total deposits, federal funds purchased, increases in short-term other borrowings, and the proceeds from the issuance by the corporation of 3.375% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, and repayments of the 5.85% subordinated notes previously issued by the bank and due november 2017.

72 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital management one of northern trust's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.
senior management, with oversight from the capital governance committee and the full board of directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. northern trust manages its capital on both a total corporation basis and a legal entity basis. the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the capital governance committee of the board of directors. in establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of northern trust's businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, and the impact on credit ratings.
capital levels were strengthened in 2018 as average stockholders' equity increased $248.3 million, or 2%, reaching $10.2 billion. total stockholders' equity was $10.5 billion at december 31, 2018, as compared to $10.2 billion at december 31, 2017. in july 2018, the board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 31% to $0.55 per common share. common dividends totaling $439.1 million were declared in 2018. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the corporation repurchased 9.0 million shares of common stock, including 0.5 million shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at an average price per share of $102.69. preferred dividends totaling $46.4 million were declared in 2018.

risk management risk management overview northern trust employs an integrated risk management framework to support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. the framework provides a methodology to identify, assess, monitor, measure, manage and report both internal and external risks to northern trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. northern trust's risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. northern trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.
northern trust's risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. the risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by northern trust, supporting the consistent identification and classification of risks across the organization. the risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. all identified risks inherent in northern trust's business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk. all material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.
northern trust implements its risk management framework through a "three lines of defense" operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. the model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each a complimentary level of risk management accountability. within this operating model, northern trust's businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. the risk management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for northern trust's risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. audit services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.
risk governance and oversight overview risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at northern trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. the diagram below provides a high-level overview of northern trust's risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the board of directors and key risk-related committees.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust's incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with northern trust's safety, soundness, and culture. this assessment includes an evaluation of whether northern trust's incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. the capital governance committee of the board assists the board in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and resolution planning activities. among other responsibilities, the capital governance committee oversees northern trust's capital adequacy assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual ccar exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. accordingly, the capital governance committee provides oversight with respect to northern trust's linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.
the chief risk officer (cro) oversees northern trust's management of risk and compliance, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. the cro reports directly to the business risk committee and the corporation's chief executive officer. the cro regularly advises the business risk committee and reports to the committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. in accordance with the risk management framework, the executive risk management team of northern trust, together with the chief financial officer, head of capital and resolution planning, general counsel and chief audit executive, meets as the global enterprise risk committee (gerc) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk within northern trust. among other risk management responsibilities, gerc receives reports or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. senior risk committees include:
the credit risk committee (crc) establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application.
the operational risk committee (orc) provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the corporate operational risk management policy and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities.
the fiduciary risk committee (frc) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities.
the compliance & ethics oversight committee (ceoc) provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the corporation.
the market & liquidity risk committee (mlrc) oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.
the model risk oversight committee (mroc) is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within northern trust.
in addition to the aforementioned committees, northern trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into gerc.
risk assessment, appetite and reporting processes as part of the integrated risk framework, northern trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. northern trust's risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.
northern trust defines its risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives and remain in compliance with applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. it includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks, using both
76 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance threshold and guideline levels that trigger escalation to senior management.
risk control risk control is an internal, independent review function within the risk management function. risk control is managed by the head of risk control and is comprised of model risk management, credit review, global compliance testing and basel independent verification groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. credit review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust. global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. lastly, basel independent verification promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust's ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity stress testing. the business risk committee oversees risk control generally as well as each of these groups.
audit services audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust's risk management framework. audit services is managed by the chief audit executive with oversight from the audit committee. audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee. audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. the chief audit executive reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation's chief executive officer.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.
credit risk overview credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust's activities. a significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. northern trust's loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large u.s. financial institutions in that northern trust is generally:
•   not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;
•   not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and
•   not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging.
credit risk framework and governance the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. to monitor and control credit risk, the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent relationship-based credit culture. this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, programs, and external regulations.
the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust's diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust.
the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee. credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee. the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties.
the crc establishes and monitors credit-related policies and programs throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application. the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro and chairs the crc. independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control.
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 77
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk measurement an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust's internal risk rating system. northern trust's internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor's or counterparty's probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity.
the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control.
loans and other extensions of credit a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the "off-balance-sheet arrangements" section and in note 28, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
as part of northern trust's credit processes, the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off. northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. independent from the credit risk management function, credit review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management's implementation of the credit risk management's requirements.
counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including over-the-counter (otc) currency and interest rate derivatives, and from indemnified securities lending transactions. credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.
to calculate exposure, northern trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives. the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity.
credit risk mitigation northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. however, northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.
physical and financial collateral: northern trust's primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral. residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.
netting: on-balance-sheet netting is employed on a limited basis. netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
guarantees: personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust's claims relative to other creditors. northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.
78 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.
operational risk overview operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust's businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or other catastrophes to result in losses. this includes the potential that continuity of service and resiliency may be impacted.
operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the corporation's risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.
operational risk framework and governance to monitor and control operational risk, northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation's operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust. it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trust's exposure to loss. several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:
•   loss event data program - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a basel advanced measurement approach (ama) capital quantification.
•   risk and control self-assessment - a structured risk management process used by northern trust's businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments, processes and activities and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls.
•   operational risk scenario analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses.
•   product and process risk management program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and related significant loss events.
•   outsourcing risk management program - a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing.
•   information security and technology risk management - a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security, including cyber threats and technology risks to the organization.
•   business continuity and disaster recovery management program - a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident.
•   physical security - a program that provides for the safety of northern trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide.
•   insurance management program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events.
as discussed in risk control, model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework.
the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the corporate operational risk policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management's insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks.
operational risk measurement northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable u.s. banking subsidiaries. northern trust's ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data, risk and control self-assessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 79
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital. business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.
information security and technology management effective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. northern trust's information security and technology risk management framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and an information security and technology risk management policy and program approved by the business risk committee. the framework is supported by an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the businesses, including the information security and technology risk committee (istrc). the istrc is chaired by the chief information security officer, who regularly reports to the business risk committee on the status of the information security and technology risk management program.
in addition to a strong governance process, internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust's overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates. northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer-based training, phishing simulations, and the designation of individuals as information security and privacy champions within the businesses. in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.
in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, northern trust uses external third-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness. these teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of northern trust's susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan.
the cyber incident response plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents. a cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity, which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions, denials, compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality, integrity and availably of the assets of northern trust or its clients. the plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions and status to senior management, including the chief information security officer, and appropriate stakeholders. the plan is designed to work with enterprise-level response plans, and is reviewed, tested, and updated regularly.
northern trust's disclosure controls and procedures also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents. northern trust also maintains compliance programs to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information, including in instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents.
business resiliency and continuity management northern trust's business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes mission-critical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements.
northern trust's business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.
all of northern trust's businesses are required to risk-assess their critical functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis. all of northern trust's businesses test their plans at least annually.
the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee.
80 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiduciary risk fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients' fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document.
fiduciary risk overview the fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization's overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level.
fiduciary risk framework and governance the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. in addition, the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to northern trust. compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:
•   regulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.
•   financial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.
compliance risk framework and governance the compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee.
each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. each business is responsible for its respective employees' compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust's compliance and ethics program.
the ceoc establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust's compliance and ethics program. the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee, as appropriate, and chairs the ceoc.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide events.
liquidity risk overview northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile. northern trust's balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. that is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits. this liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. northern trust's balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.
2018 annual report | northern trust corporation 81
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons.
the asset and liability management committee (alco) provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows and stress test results. the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.
liquidity risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.
the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. both northern trust's treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. holistic liquidity metrics such as lcr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.
market risk there are two types of market risk, interest rate risk and trading risk. interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.
market risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
exposure limits for market risk are set by the board, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (nii), sensitivity of market value of equity (mve), and value-at-risk (var) across a range of time horizons.
alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as stress test results. the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement.
interest rate risk overview interest rate risk is the risk to nii, associated with the balance sheet, or mve due to changes in interest rates. changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the mve. to mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are highly correlated, which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.
82 2018 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations there are four commonly recognized types of structured interest rate risk:
•   repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;
•   yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;
•   basis, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and
•   behavioral characteristics embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.
interest rate risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: nii and mve sensitivity. nii sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii. mve sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on mve as of the period-end balance sheet. both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances.
northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:
•   purchase of securities;
•   sale of debt securities that are classified as available for sale;
•   issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;
•   collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank;
•   placing and taking eurodollar time deposits; and
•   hedges with various types of derivative financial instruments.
nii sensitivity the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation:
•   the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;
•   prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;
•   cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;
•   nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on northern trust's actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and
•   new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. for that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. further, the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to the impact of certain client deposit modeling enhancements.
mve sensitivity mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. northern trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation:
•   the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of northern trust's actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment - some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives; and
•   the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values.
the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates.

foreign currency risk overview northern trust's balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-u.s. subsidiaries, and future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense. to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust's currency exposure to future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense.
in addition, northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients. most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust's growing global custody business. in the normal course of business, northern trust also engages in trading of non-u.s. currencies for its own account. both activities are considered trading activities. the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk.
foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the u.s. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods.
foreign currency risk measurement northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-u.s. currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology. this statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-u.s. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.
var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust's trading systems each day. data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.
foreign currency risk monitoring, reporting and analysis northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. variations include different methodologies (historical, variance-covariance and monte carlo), equally weighted and exponentially weighted volatilities, horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels ranging from 95% to 99.95% and look back periods of one year and four years. those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust's market risks.
automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.
the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally weighted volatility. the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other nonmaterial trading activities market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. northern trust's broker-dealer, northern trust securities, inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes, which averaged $1.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients' interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps, floors, and swaptions (an option to enter into an interest rate swap). all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department. when northern trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities.
strategic risk strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. strategic risk includes the following three subcategories:
•   macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, which centers on events or themes that would have a significant, detrimental impact on financial markets, and by extension, financial services firms. episodes of this kind would tend to have general, as opposed to idiosyncratic, consequences.
•   business risk, which arises from change in the following areas:
•   internal: situations within northern trust that threaten business continuity, profitability, or the achievement of strategic objectives
•   secular: behavioral or technological change that affects clients and renders a northern trust process or service obsolete
•   competitive: new products or shifts in the industry landscape that challenge northern trust's performance
•   regulatory: changes to prudential or fiscal policy that have an adverse impact on northern trust or its clients
•   reputation risk is a residual risk which arises from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects northern trust's ability to conduct its business. reputation risk can arise from a range of risk events and is not limited to strategic risk.
strategic risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies and practices designed to identify, analyze, and limit (where possible) the impact of strategic risk. the strategic risk management function is responsible for defining this framework and providing independent oversight of its application across northern trust. in furtherance of this effort, northern trust has established governance around its strategic planning processes to review and challenge strategic decisions.
in addition, northern trust maintains a global stress testing framework which guides stress testing exercises across the company. enterprise stress testing, a component of this effort, is specifically designed to look at the prospective impact of internal and external shocks on the organization. northern trust also maintains the global emergency response plan, which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise.
both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk.

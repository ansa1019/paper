overall results for fiscal 2018, consolidated net sales increased 14% as compared to fiscal 2017. after adjusting for the impacts of the trevigen, atlanta biologicals and eurocell acquisitions in fiscal 2018, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 9% with currency translation contributing 2% and acquisitions contributing 3%. the organic growth was broad-based as the company achieved high-single digit growth in the us with contributions from both the academic and bio-pharma end-markets. europe sales grew in the mid-teens with growth in both the academic and bio-pharma end-markets. china sales grew nearly 25% and japan sales grew in the mid-teens while the rest of the asia-pacific region grew in the high-teens.
consolidated gaap net earnings increased 65% for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 24% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. adjusted earnings growth was driven by strong volume leverage and the benefit from tax reform, which was partially offset by negative business mix, lower margin acquisitions, and investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure.
for fiscal 2017, consolidated net sales increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for the impacts of the space and advanced cell diagnostics (acd) acquisitions in fiscal 2017, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 6% with currency translation having a negative impact of 1% and acquisitions contributing 8%. the organic growth was broad-based, with the company achieving growth in all three of its reporting segments. a strong bio-pharma end-market in the us and europe and additional market demand for protein platforms instruments were the biggest contributing factors to organic growth.
consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 27% for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. adjusted earnings growth was driven by strong volume leverage, which was offset by negative mix and a negative impact from foreign currency translation.

in fiscal 2017, the protein platforms segment net sales increased 18% compared to fiscal 2016. organic growth for the segment was 19% with acquisitions contributing 1% and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2%. growth was broad-based and led by additional market demand for simple western (wes) instruments and consumables, and the simple plex (ella) and biologics (maurice) product lines.
in fiscal 2017, diagnostics segment net sales increased 3% compared to fiscal 2016. all results for fiscal 2017 were organic. timing of oem orders had a negative impact on fiscal 2017 results. mid-single digit sales growth in blood and glucose-based controls was partially offset by the timing of oem shipments from the diagnostic assay and reagent product lines.
gross margins consolidated gross margins were 67.2%, 66.5% and 67.5% in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2018, 2017, 2016 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 71.5%, 71.2% and 70.8% in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:

amortization of intangibles                                3.9   %           4.1   %           2.2   %
non-gaap adjusted gross margin percentage                 71.5   %          71.2   %          70.8   %
fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company's three business segments. since these results are used for this purpose, they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap. segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,

2018              2017              2016
biotechnology              79.4   %          80.5   %          80.0   %
protein platforms          69.6   %          67.6   %          67.8   %
diagnostics                43.5   %          42.3   %          44.8   %
the decrease in the biotechnology segment's gross margin percentage for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales made in this segment. the improvements in the protein platforms and diagnostics gross margin percentages for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 were due to higher volume leverage and operational productivity.
24
the biotechnology improvement for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to higher volume leverage and operational productivity. the diagnostics and protein platforms segment gross margin percentages for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by lower volume leverage and margin mix of product sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2 million (20%) and $59.6 million (42%) in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the increase in fiscal 2018 was driven by additional investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure, a larger cost base due to acquisitions and $13.6 million of additional stock-based compensation expense of which $8.3 million is from a new retirement policy that permits retirees to continue vesting in certain time-based stock options granted during employment, resulting in accelerated stock compensation expense for those employees meeting the definition of retirement eligible.
the increase in fiscal 2017 was driven by additional expenses associated with the space, acd and zephyrus acquisitions including $21.1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses, a $3.0 million increase in acquisition intangible amortization, a $18.4 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration and a $4.6 million increase in other acquisition related costs. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to additional investments in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, including increased stock compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefit increases.

during the third quarter fiscal 2018, the company recognized a $16.2 million impairment on the write-down of its investment in astute medical, inc. (astute) in anticipation of the amount of cash to be received upon completion of the sale of astute to a third party. the astute sale closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 at the anticipated amount. this loss was offset by a $16.1 million gain on the sale of a portion of the company's investment in chemocentryx, inc. (ccxi) and a $0.5 million gain on the sale of investment property in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. these gains and losses are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.
income taxes income taxes for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were at effective rates of (0.2)%, 32.0%, and 29.2%, respectively, of consolidated earnings before income taxes. the effective rate for june 30, 2018 decreased by 32.2% compared to the prior year. the decrease in the company's tax rate for fiscal 2018 was due to the impact of discrete items, primarily the net tax benefit of $33.0 million related to government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). this net tax benefit consisted of $36.5 million due to the re-measurement of the company's deferred tax accounts to reflect the u.s. federal corporate tax rate reduction impact to our net deferred tax balances offset by expense for the repatriation tax of $3.3 million. also impacting the company's fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was a $2.2 million tax benefit related to stock option exercises offset by a net discrete tax expense of $4.2 million related to the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not a tax deductible expense.
the effective rate for june 30, 2017 increased by 2.8% compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to unfavorable discrete events in fiscal 2017 related to the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not a tax deductible expense. the company recognized net expense related to discrete tax items of $3.8 million in fiscal 2017, including $4.5 million in expense related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense. there were no material discrete tax items in fiscal 2016.
u.s. federal taxes have been reduced by the manufacturer's deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the u.s. federal credit for research and development. foreign income taxes have been provided at rates which approximate the tax rates in the countries in which the company has operations, exclusive of permanent items.

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and non-gaap tax rate applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 is due primarily to recording the items attributable to the new tax legislation in the u.s. which resulted in a $33.0 million tax benefit. offsetting this benefit is the impact of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible. for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, the company recorded acquisition related expense of $20.1 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration.
the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and non-gaap tax rate applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 is primarily a result of the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not tax deductible. for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017, the company recorded acquisition related expense of $18.4 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration.

critical accounting policies management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. the calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company's business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. we may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.
the fair value of acquired technology is estimated, using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. the fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquirees. the fair value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings. we generally estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. this valuation model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as a brand name or fixed assets, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. the resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the customer list asset, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. the fair value of acquired customer relationships may also be estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. assumptions used in these calculations include same-customer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees' historical information.
30
we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. assumptions used in these calculations include discount rates, projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.
the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. for example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. as goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis.
impairment of goodwill goodwill goodwill was $597.9 million as of june 30, 2018, which represented 37.5% of total assets. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.
to analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.
31
2018 and 2017 goodwill impairment analyses in completing our 2018 and 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units. a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit, which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. in accordance with asu 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. in determining the fair values of our reporting units, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit's financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. the discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we were required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items.
because our 2018 and 2017 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units, the summation of our reporting units' fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value, as indicated by our market capitalization, to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations.
the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30, 2018 and 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom. this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows, as well as our selected discount rate. changes in the reporting unit's results, forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units.
2016 goodwill impairment analysis the company used a qualitative test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2016. the company elected to utilize a quantitative test for the protein platforms reporting unit for fiscal year 2016 using the previously described income approach given that this was a newer reporting unit created primarily through acquisitions. the qualitative analyses for our other reporting units completed during 2016 evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. in completing these assessments, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. based on the testing performed for the protein platforms reporting unit, fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial amount and no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary.
there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1, 2002.
new accounting pronouncements information regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2018 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption "note 1: description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appear in item 8 of this report.

subsequent events on july 2, 2018, the company acquired qt holdings corporation (quad) for approximately $20 million plus $51 million in potential contingent consideration. on august 1, 2018, the company acquired exosome diagnostics, inc. (exosome) for approximately $250 million plus $325 million in potential contingent consideration.
in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics, inc. on august 1, 2018, the company entered into a new credit facility that provides for a revolving credit facility of $600 million, which can be increased by an additional $200 million subject to certain conditions, and a term loan of $250 million.  the credit facility is governed by a credit agreement dated august 1, 2018 and matures on august 1, 2023
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k, including "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). these non-gaap measures include:
●   adjusted gross margin

●   adjusted net earnings

●   adjusted net earnings growth

●   adjusted effective tax rate

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related expenses. the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses, from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity.
the company's non-gaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes stock based compensation expense, restructuring, impairments of equity method investments, gain and losses from investments, and certain adjustments to income tax expense. stock based compensation is excluded from non-gaap adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically, the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. impairments of equity investments are excluded as we do not have significant influence over these investments and they are not part of our day to day operating decisions. additionally, gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded.   costs related to restructuring activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. the company independently calculates a non-gaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. in addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. we believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.
the company periodically reassesses the components of our non-gaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.

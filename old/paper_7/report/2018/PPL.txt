business strategy
(all registrants)
ppl operates seven fully regulated high-performing utilities. these utilities are located in the u.k., pennsylvania and kentucky, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes. ppl believes this business portfolio positions the company well for continued success and provides earnings and dividend growth potential.
ppl's strategy, and that of the other registrants, is to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop its people. ppl's business plan is designed to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. these businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the u.s. and rav in the u.k. rate base growth is being driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for lke, lg&e and ku, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities.
37
for the u.s. businesses, central to ppl's strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual ferc formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. in kentucky, the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in addition, the kpsc requires a utility to obtain a cpcn prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital expenditures to materially affect the utility's financial condition. although such kpsc proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the kpsc, in awarding a cpcn, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. in pennsylvania, the ferc transmission formula rate, dsic mechanism, smart meter rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. in addition, the registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. see "financial condition - risk management" below for further information.
earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. because wpd's earnings represent such a significant portion of ppl's consolidated earnings, ppl enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the gbp versus the u.s. dollar. these hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under gaap. see "financial and operational developments - u.k. membership in european union" for additional discussion of the u.k. earnings hedging activity.
the u.k. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the u.s. dollar to the extent of their u.s. dollar denominated debt. to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.
as discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which the registrants operate (u.k., u.s. federal and state). this is supported by a strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.
financial and operational developments equity forward contracts (ppl)
in may 2018, ppl completed a registered underwritten public offering of 55 million shares of its common stock. in conjunction with that offering, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase 8.25 million additional shares of ppl common stock solely to cover over-allotments.
in connection with the registered public offering, ppl entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties covering the 63.25 million shares of ppl common stock. full settlement of these forward sale agreements will occur no later than november 2019. the forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. ppl only receives proceeds and issues shares of common stock upon any settlements of the forward sale agreements. ppl intends to use net proceeds that it receives upon any settlements for general corporate purposes.
in september 2018, ppl settled a portion of the initial forward sale agreements by issuing 20 million shares of ppl common stock, and received net cash proceeds of $520 million. for the unsettled portion of the agreements, the only impact to the financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted eps using the treasury stock method.
see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.

u.s. tax reform (all registrants)
the registrants recognized certain provisional amounts relating to the impact of the enactment of the tcja in their december 31, 2017 financial statements, in accordance with sec guidance. included in those provisional amounts were estimates of: tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, accumulated foreign earnings, foreign tax credits, and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which were based on the interpretation and application of various provisions of the tcja.
in the third quarter of 2018, ppl filed its consolidated federal income tax return, which was prepared using guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department and the irs since the filing of each registrant's 2017 form 10-k. accordingly, the registrants have updated the following provisional amounts and now consider them to be complete: (1) the amount of the deemed dividend and associated foreign tax credits relating to the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings as of december 31, 2017; (2) the amount of accelerated 100% "bonus" depreciation ppl was eligible to claim in its 2017 federal income tax return; and (3) the related impacts on ppl's 2017 consolidated federal net operating loss to be carried forward to future periods. in addition, the registrants recorded the tax impact of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% on the changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the completed provisional amounts. the completed provisional amounts related to the tax rate reduction had an insignificant impact on the net regulatory liabilities of ppl's u.s. regulated operations. in the fourth quarter of 2018, ppl completed its analysis of the deductibility of executive compensation awarded as of november 2, 2017 and concluded that no material change to the provisional amounts is required. see note 6 to the financial statements for the final amounts reported in ppl's 2017 federal income tax return, provisional adjustment amounts for the year ended december 31, 2017, the related measurement period adjustments and the resulting tax impact for 2018.
the registrants' accounting related to the effects of the tcja on financial results for the period ended december 31, 2017 is complete as of december 31, 2018 with respect to all provisional amounts.
in 2018, the irs issued proposed regulations for certain provisions of the tcja, including interest deductibility, base erosion anti-avoidance tax (beat), and global intangible low-taxed income (gilti). ppl has determined that the proposed regulations related to beat and gilti do not materially change ppl's current interpretation of the statutory impact of these rules on the company. proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in november 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. these proposed regulations should not apply to the registrants until the year in which the regulations are issued in final form, which is expected to be 2019. it is uncertain what form the final regulations will take and, therefore, the registrants cannot predict what impact the final regulations will have on the tax deductibility of interest expense. however, if the proposed regulations were issued as final in their current form, the registrants could have a limitation on a portion of their interest expense deduction for tax purposes and such limitation could be significant.
kentucky state tax reform (all registrants)
hb 487, which became law on april 27, 2018, provides for significant changes to the kentucky tax code including (1) adopting mandatory combined reporting for corporate members of unitary business groups for taxable years beginning on or after january 1, 2019 (members of a unitary business group may make an eight-year binding election to file consolidated corporate income tax returns with all members of their federal affiliated group) and (2) a reduction in the kentucky corporate income tax rate from 6% to 5% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017. lke recognized a deferred tax charge of $9 million in the second quarter of 2018 primarily associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances.
as indicated in note 1 to the financial statements, lg&e's and ku's accounting for income taxes is impacted by rate regulation. therefore, reductions in regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the kentucky corporate income tax rate to 5% under the provisions of hb 487 will result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers in future periods. in the second quarter of 2018, lg&e and ku recorded the impact of the reduced tax rate, related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, as an increase in regulatory liabilities of $16 million and $19 million. in a separate regulatory proceeding, lg&e and ku have requested to begin returning state excess deferred income taxes to customers in conjunction with the 2018 kentucky base rate case, which was filed on september 28, 2018. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information related to the rate case proceedings. ppl is evaluating the impact, if any, of unitary or elective consolidated income tax reporting on all its registrants.

u.k. membership in european union (ppl)
the u.k. formally began the process of leaving the european union (eu) on march 29, 2017 by triggering article 50 of the lisbon treaty. the u.k. has two years from that date to negotiate a withdrawal agreement governing its exit from the eu (brexit). the u.k. and eu also agreed to a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, during which both parties will negotiate a future trade relationship. the final withdrawal agreement and future trade relationship are subject to ratification by both the u.k. and eu parliaments.
in november 2018, u.k. prime minister theresa may and the eu decided on a withdrawal agreement covering a broad range of issues. on january 15, 2019, the u.k. parliament voted overwhelmingly to reject this withdrawal agreement. on january 29, 2019, the u.k. parliament voted on a series of non-binding amendments to influence future brexit negotiations, directing may to conduct further negotiations with the eu. the eu has said that it is not prepared to renegotiate the existing deal.
significant uncertainty surrounds the status of negotiations and next steps in the brexit process. if an agreement is not reached, the default position is that the u.k. will have a disorderly exit from the eu on march 29, 2019. the u.k. may also request an extension of the article 50 process, subject to approval from the eu's 27 remaining members. the u.k. could also choose to revoke article 50 and remain in the eu.
ppl believes that its greatest risk related to brexit is the potential decline in the value of the gbp compared to the u.s. dollar. a decline in the value of the gbp compared to the u.s. dollar will reduce the value of wpd's earnings to ppl.
ppl has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to its u.k. earnings. as of february 6, 2019, ppl's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per gbp and 49% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.49 per gbp.
ppl cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or ppl's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the u.k. government to withdraw from the eu, although such impacts could be material.
ppl does not expect the financial condition and results of operations of wpd itself to change significantly as a result of brexit, with or without an approved plan of withdrawal. the regulatory environment and operation of wpd's businesses are not expected to change. wpd is less than halfway through riio-ed1, the current price control period, with allowed revenues agreed with ofgem through march 2023. the impact of a slower economy or recession on wpd would be mitigated in part because u.k. regulation provides that any reduction in the volume of electricity delivered will be recovered in allowed revenues in future periods through the k-factor adjustment. see "item 1. business - segment information - u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on the current price control and k-factor adjustment. in addition, an increase in inflation would have a positive effect on revenues and rav as annual inflation adjustments are applied to both revenues and rav (and real returns are earned on inflated rav). this impact, however, would be partially offset by higher o&m and interest expense on index-linked debt. with respect to access to financing, wpd has substantial borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and expects to continue to have access to all major financial markets. with respect to access to and cost of equipment and other materials, wpd management continues to review u.k. government issued advice on preparations for brexit without an approved plan of withdrawal and has taken actions to mitigate potential increasing costs and disruption to its critical sources of supply. additionally, less than 1% of wpd's employees are non-u.k. eu nationals and no change in their domicile is expected.

tcja impact on lg&e and ku rates (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
on december 21, 2017, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. submitted a complaint with the kpsc against lg&e and ku, as well as other utility companies in kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the tcja, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. the complaint requested the kpsc to issue an order requiring lg&e and ku to begin deferring, as of january 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.
on january 29, 2018, lg&e, ku, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. and the office of the attorney general reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the tcja to their customers through their ecr, dsm and lg&e's glt rate mechanisms beginning in march 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from april 1, 2018 through april 30, 2019 and thereafter until tax-reform related savings are reflected in changes in base rates. the estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in ku electricity revenues ($70 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $69 million in lg&e electricity revenues ($49 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $17 million in lg&e gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period january 2018 through april 2019.
on march 20, 2018, the kpsc issued an order approving, with certain modifications, the settlement agreement reached between lg&e, ku, kentucky industrial utility customers, inc. and the office of the attorney general. the kpsc estimates that, pursuant to its modifications, electricity revenues would incorporate reductions of approximately $108 million for ku ($87 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $79 million for lg&e ($59 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms). this represents $27 million ($17 million at ku and $10 million at lg&e) in additional reductions from the amounts proposed by the settlement. the kpsc's modifications to the settlement include certain changes in assumptions or inputs used in assessing tax reform or calculating lg&e's and ku's electricity rates. lg&e gas rate reductions were not modified significantly from the amount included in the settlement agreement.
on september 28, 2018, the kpsc issued an order on reconsideration, pursuant to lg&e's and ku's petition, implementing rates reflecting electricity revenue reductions of $101 million for ku ($80 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $74 million for lg&e electricity revenues ($54 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $16 million lg&e gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period january 2018 through april 2019. this represents lower revenue reduction amounts than the march 20, 2018 order of approximately $13 million ($7 million at ku and $6 million at lg&e).
in january 2018, the vscc ordered ku, as well as other utilities in virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate. in march 2018, ku reached a settlement agreement regarding its rate case in virginia. new rates, inclusive of tcja impacts, were effective june 1, 2018. the settlement also stipulates that actual tax savings for the five month period prior to new rates taking effect would be addressed through ku's annual information filing for calendar year 2018. in may 2018, the vscc approved the settlement agreement. the tcja and rate case are not expected to have a significant impact on ku's financial condition or results of operations related to virginia.
on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued a policy statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the tcja will be addressed in a notice of proposed rulemaking. also on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued the notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. the notice of proposed rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. lg&e and ku are currently assessing the notice of proposed rulemaking and are continuing to monitor guidance issued by the ferc. on february 5, 2019, in connection with a separate element of federal and kentucky state tax reform effects, lg&e and ku filed a request with the ferc to amend their transmission formula rates, effective june 1, 2019, to incorporate reductions to corporate income tax rates as a result of the tcja and hb 487. lg&e and ku do not anticipate the impact of the tcja related to their ferc-jurisdictional rates to be significant.

(ppl and ppl electric)
tcja impact on ppl electric rates on february 12, 2018, the puc issued a secretarial letter requesting certain information from regulated utilities and inviting comment from interested parties on potential revision to customer rates as a result of enactment of the tcja. ppl electric submitted its response to the secretarial letter on march 9, 2018. on march 15, 2018, the puc issued a temporary rates order to allow time to determine the manner in which rates could be adjusted in response to the tcja. the puc issued another temporary rates order on may 17, 2018 to address the impact of the tcja and indicated that utilities without a currently pending general rate proceeding would receive a utility specific order. the puc issued an order specific to ppl electric on may 17, 2018 that required ppl electric to file a tariff or tariff supplement by june 15, 2018 to establish (a) temporary rates to be effective july 1, 2018, and (b) to record a deferred regulatory liability to reflect the tax savings associated with the tcja for the period january 1 through june 30, 2018. on june 8, 2018, ppl electric submitted a petition to the puc to charge a negative surcharge of 7.05% to reflect the estimated 2018 tax savings associated with the tcja. the puc approved ppl electric's petition on june 14, 2018 and ppl electric filed a tariff on june 15, 2018 reflecting the increased negative surcharge. ppl electric recorded a $41 million noncurrent regulatory liability and a corresponding reduction of revenue to be distributed to customers pursuant to a future rate adjustment related to the period january 1, 2018 through june 30, 2018.
on march 15, 2018, the ferc issued a notice of inquiry seeking information on whether and how it should address changes to ferc-jurisdictional rates relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation resulting from passage of the tcja. on march 16, 2018, ppl electric filed a waiver request, pursuant to rule 207(a)(5) of the rules of practice and procedure of the ferc, to accelerate incorporation of the changes to the federal corporate income tax rate in its transmission formula rate commencing on june 1, 2018 rather than allowing the tcja tax rate reduction to be initially incorporated in ppl electric's june 1, 2019 transmission formula rate. the waiver was approved on april 23, 2018 and ppl electric submitted its transmission formula rate, reflecting the tcja rate reduction, on april 27, 2018. in addition, on may 21, 2018, ppl electric, as part of a pjm transmission owners joint filing, submitted comments in response to the ferc's march 15, 2018 notice of inquiry. the filing requested guidance on how the reduction in accumulated deferred income taxes, resulting from the tcja reduced federal corporate income tax rate, should be treated for ratemaking purposes. on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued a policy statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the tcja will be addressed in a notice of proposed rulemaking. also on november 15, 2018, the ferc issued the notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers should include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. the notice of proposed rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. ppl electric is currently assessing the notice of proposed rulemaking and is continuing to monitor guidance issued by the ferc. the changes, related to accumulated deferred income taxes impacting the transmission formula rate revenues, have not been significant since the new rate went into effect on june 1, 2018.
pennsylvania alternative ratemaking in june 2018, governor tom wolf signed house bill 1782 (now known as act 58 of 2018, and to be codified at 66 pa. c.s. § 1330) authorizing public utilities to implement alternative rates and rate mechanisms in base rate proceedings before the puc. the effective date of act 58 was august 27, 2018.
under the new law, a public utility may file an application to establish alternative rates and rate mechanisms in a base rate proceeding. these alternative rates and rate mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the following: decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates, multi-year rate plans, or a combination of those or other mechanisms.
the alternative rate mechanisms may include reconcilable surcharges and rates established under current law, including returns on and return of capital investments. act 58 explicitly provides that it does not invalidate or void any rate mechanisms approved by the puc prior to the legislation's effective date. act 58 also specifies customer notice requirements concerning the utility's application for alternative rates or rate mechanisms.
on august 23, 2018, the puc issued a tentative implementation order seeking comments on its proposed interpretation and implementation of act 58, section 1330 of the public utility code, 66 pa. c.s. 1330. ppl electric and various other parties filed comments on october 8, 2018. this matter remains pending before the puc.
ppl electric views the passage of act 58 to be a favorable regulatory development that is expected to expand the rate-making mechanisms available to pennsylvania regulated utility companies.

(ppl)
riio-ed1 mid-period review the riio framework allowed for an mpr. on april 30, 2018, ofgem announced its decision not to conduct an mpr of the riio-ed1 price control period.
riio-2 framework review on march 7, 2018, ofgem issued its consultation document on the riio-2 framework, which covers all u.k. gas and electricity transmission and distribution price controls. the current electricity distribution price control, riio-ed1, continues through march 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this riio-2 consultation process. ofgem consulted on a wide range of issues, including cost of debt and equity methodologies, the length of the price control period, indexation methodologies, innovation, stakeholder engagement in the business planning process and performance incentive mechanisms. the purpose of the riio-2 framework consultation was to build on lessons learned from the current price controls while supporting low costs to consumers, improved customer service and reliability, and the u.k.'s continued shift to a low-carbon future. comments on the riio-2 framework were due in may 2018. on july 30, 2018, ofgem published its decision following its riio-2 framework consultation after consideration of comments received. ofgem confirmed the following points in the decision document:
•   there will be a five-year default length for the price control period, compared to eight years in the current riio-ed1 price control.
•   there is intent to shift the inflation index used for calculating rav and allowed returns from rpi to cpih. ofgem stated overall, consumers and investors as a whole will be neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of the shift to cpih and a transition period may be required.
•   there will be no change to the existing depreciation policy of using economic asset lives as the basis for depreciating rav as part of base revenue calculations. wpd is currently transitioning to 45 year asset lives for new additions in riio-ed1 based on ofgem's extensive review of asset lives in riio-ed1.
•   ofgem will retain the option for fast-tracking for electricity distribution companies only. fast tracking will be further considered as part of the electricity distribution sector specific consultation.
•   a new enhanced engagement model will be introduced which will require distribution companies to set up a customer engagement group to provide ofgem with a public report of their views on the companies' business plans from the perspective of local stakeholders. ofgem will also establish an independent riio-2 challenge group comprised of consumer experts to provide ofgem with a public report on companies' business plans.
•   ofgem intends to expand the role of competition for projects that are new, separable and high value. wpd does not currently have any planned projects that would meet the high value threshold.
•   a focus of riio-2 will be on whole-system outcomes. ofgem envisions network companies and system operators working together to ensure the energy system as a whole is efficient and delivers best value to consumers. ofgem is undertaking further work to clarify the definition of whole-system and the appropriate roles of the network companies in supporting the energy transition.
ofgem also indicated further work is needed on other price control principles, including but not limited to, cost of equity, cost of debt, financeability and incentives with decisions on these items expected to be made in the sector specific consultations or within the individual company business plan submissions.
in december 2018, the promulgation of sector specific price controls began with ofgem publishing its consultation related to its riio-2 price controls for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission operators that will be effective from april 2021 to march 2026. this current consultation does not apply directly to electricity distribution network operators although some decisions will be precedent setting. the electricity distribution price control work is scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time ofgem plans to publish its riio-ed2 strategy consultation document.
although the electricity distribution consultation does not commence until 2020, wpd is engaged in the riio-2 process and will be responding to the december 2018 consultation document. ppl cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final riio-ed2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations.

(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
ferc transmission rate filing on august 3, 2018, lg&e and ku submitted an application to the ferc requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of lg&e's and ku's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of lg&e and ku from the midcontinent independent system operator, inc. (miso), a regional transmission operator and energy market. the application seeks termination of lg&e's and ku's commitment to provide mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 merger for certain transmission service between miso and lg&e and ku. the affected transmission customers are a limited number of municipal entities in kentucky. the amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits for either lg&e and ku or for miso transmission charges depending upon the direction of transmission service incurred by the municipalities. lg&e and ku estimate that such charges may average approximately $22 million annually, depending upon actual transmission customer and market volumes, structures and prices, with such charges allocated according to lg&e's and ku's respective transmission system ownership ratio. due to the development of robust accessible energy markets over time, lg&e and ku believe the mitigation commitments are no longer relevant or appropriate. lg&e and ku currently receive recovery of such expenses in other rate mechanisms. lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding, including any effects on their financial condition or results of operations.
the businesses of lke, lg&e and ku are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to ccrs, ghg, and elgs. see note 7, note 13 and note 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. these and other stringent environmental requirements led ppl, lke, lg&e and ku to retire approximately 800 mw of coal-fired generating plants in kentucky, primarily in 2015. additionally, ku anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the e.w. brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw.
also as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, lke projects $682 million ($261 million at lg&e and $421 million at ku) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. see ppl's "financial condition - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures", note 7 and note 13 for additional information.
rate case proceedings
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
on september 28, 2018, lg&e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for an increase in annual base electricity rates of approximately $112 million at ku and increases in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $35 million and $25 million at lg&e. the proposed base rate increases would result in an electricity rate increase of 6.9% at ku and electricity and gas rate increases of 3% and 7.5% at lg&e. as discussed in the "tcja impact on lg&e and ku rates" section above, lg&e's and ku's applications seek to include applicable changes associated with the tcja in the calculation of the proposed base rates and to terminate the tcja bill credit mechanism when the new base rates go into effect.
new rates are expected to become effective on may 1, 2019. the applications are based on a forecasted test year of may 1, 2019 through april 30, 2020 with a requested return-on-equity of 10.42%. a number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceeding. data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through february 2019 and a hearing is scheduled in march 2019. lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
(lke and ku)
in september 2017, ku filed a request seeking approval from the vscc to increase annual virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. on march 22, 2018, ku reached a settlement agreement regarding the case, including the impact of the tcja on rates, resulting in an increase in annual virginia base electricity revenue of $2 million. this represents an increase of 2.8% with rates effective june 1, 2018. on may 8, 2018, the vscc issued an order approving the settlement agreement.

results of operations
(ppl)
the "statement of income analysis" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on ppl's statements of income, comparing year-to-year changes. the "segment earnings" and "adjusted gross margins" discussions for ppl provide a review of results by reportable segment. these discussions include non-gaap financial measures, including "earnings from ongoing operations" and "adjusted gross margins," and provide explanations of the non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable gaap measure. the "2019 outlook" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2019 earnings.
tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "statement of income analysis," "segment earnings" and "adjusted gross margins" are presented on a constant gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. results computed on a constant gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average gbp to u.s. dollar exchange rate.

(a)   the decrease in 2018 compared with 2017 is related to the impact of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the tcja, effective january 1, 2018.
(b)   during 2017, ppl recorded an increase in valuation allowances of $23 million primarily related to foreign tax credits recorded in 2016. the future utilization of these credits is expected to be lower as a result of the tcja.
during 2018, 2017 and 2016, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense of $24 million, $16 million and $13 million for valuation allowances primarily related to increased pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized.
(c)   during 2017, ppl recorded a federal income tax benefit of $35 million primarily attributable to uk pension contributions.
during 2017, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense of $83 million primarily related to enactment of the tcja. the enacted tax law included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective january 1, 2018. in the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on ppl's unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. these earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to ppl of approximately $462 million, including $205 million of foreign tax credits. as the ppl consolidated u.s. group had a taxable loss for 2017,
48
inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, these credits were recorded as a deferred tax asset. however, it is expected that under the tcja, only $83 million of the $205 million of foreign tax credits will be realized in the carry forward period. accordingly, a valuation allowance on the current year foreign tax credits in the amount of $122 million has been recorded to reflect the reduction in the future utilization of the credits. the foreign tax credits associated with the deemed repatriation result in a gross carryforward and corresponding deferred tax asset of $205 million offset by a valuation allowance of $122 million.
during 2016, ppl recorded a federal income tax benefit of $40 million attributable to the foreign tax credit carrryforwards, arising from a decision to amend prior year tax returns to claim foreign tax credits rather than deduct foreign taxes. this decision was prompted by changes to the company's most recent business plan.
(d)   the u.k. finance act 2016, enacted in september 2016, reduced the u.k. statutory income tax rate effective april 1, 2020 to 17%. as a result, ppl reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $42 million deferred income tax benefit during 2016.
(e)   the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% significantly reduced the difference between the u.k. and u.s. income tax rates in 2018 compared with 2017.
(f)   during 2018, ppl recorded lower income tax expense for the amortization of excess deferred income taxes that primarily resulted from the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted by the tcja.
(g)   during 2017, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense for the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted by the tcja.
(h)   during 2018, ppl recorded deferred income tax expense, primarily associated with lke's non-regulated entities, due to the kentucky corporate income tax rate reduction from 6% to 5%, as enacted by hb 487, effective january 1, 2018.

earnings from ongoing operations management utilizes "earnings from ongoing operations" as a non-gaap financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with gaap. ppl believes that earnings from ongoing operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of ppl's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. in addition, ppl's management uses earnings from ongoing operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.
earnings from ongoing operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the effective tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. special items include:
•   unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below).
•   spinoff of the supply segment.
•   gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
•   impairment charges.
•   significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.
•   acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.
•   other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.
49
unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge gbp-denominated anticipated earnings. the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within gaap earnings. management believes that excluding these amounts from earnings from ongoing operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of ppl's underlying hedged earnings. see note 17 to the financial statements and "risk management" below for additional information on foreign currency economic activity.

adjusted gross margins management also utilizes the following non-gaap financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.
•   "u.k. adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the u.k. regulated segment. in calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from national grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in england and wales, and ofgem license fees (recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed through to customers. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across wpd's distribution network in the u.k. and directly related activities.
•   "kentucky adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the kentucky regulated segment, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as well as the kentucky regulated segment's, lke's and lg&amp;e's distribution and sale of natural gas. in calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from operating revenues. in addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "other operation and maintenance", "depreciation" and "taxes, other than income" on the statements of income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. these mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.
•   "pennsylvania adjusted gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the pennsylvania regulated segment and ppl electric. in calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a plr, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "energy purchases," "other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily act 129, storm damage and universal service program costs), "depreciation" (which is primarily related to the act 129 smart meter program) and "taxes, other than income," (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the statements of income. this measure represents the net revenues from the pennsylvania regulated segment's and ppl electric's electricity delivery operations.
these measures are not intended to replace "operating income," which is determined in accordance with gaap, as an indicator of overall operating performance. other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. these performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and ppl's board of directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.

2019 outlook
(ppl)
lower net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018. the decrease in net income primarily reflects the 2018 favorable impact of unrealized gains on foreign currency economic hedges. excluding 2018 special items, net income is expected to increase primarily attributable to increases in the u.k. regulated segment and the corporate and other category. the following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for ppl's segments and the corporate and other category and the related registrants.
(ppl's u.k. regulated segment)
lower net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018. the decrease in net income reflects the 2018 favorable impact of unrealized gains on foreign currency economic hedges. excluding 2018 special items, net income is expected to increase driven primarily by higher revenues from higher prices, higher pension income and higher assumed gbp exchange rates, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher income taxes.
(ppl's kentucky regulated segment and lke, lg&e and ku)
comparable net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments, offset by an assumed return to normal weather, higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense.

adjusted gross margins
"adjusted gross margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - adjusted gross margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the factors underlying changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, lke's adjusted gross margins are referred to as "kentucky adjusted gross margins."

(a)   there are no items management considers special for the periods presented.
earnings in 2018 compared with 2017 increased primarily due to higher electricity and gas sales volumes driven by favorable weather in 2018, higher base electricity and gas rates effective july 1, 2017 and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense.
earnings in 2017 compared with 2016 increased primarily due to higher base electricity and gas rates effective july 1, 2017, partially offset by lower electricity and gas sales volumes driven by milder weather in 2017 and higher depreciation expense.

adjusted gross margins
"adjusted gross margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - adjusted gross margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, lg&e's adjusted gross margins are included in "kentucky adjusted gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income" for the periods ended december 31.

adjusted gross margins
"adjusted gross margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. see ppl's "results of operations - adjusted gross margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the factors underlying changes between periods. within ppl's discussion, ku's adjusted gross margins are included in "kentucky adjusted gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income."

•   the increase in cash from changes in working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in unbilled revenues (primarily due to milder weather in december 2018 compared to 2017), an increase in accrued taxes and accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments), and a decrease in net regulatory assets and liabilities (primarily due to the impact of the tjca and the timing of rate recovery mechanisms), partially offset by an increase in fuel purchases (primarily due to higher generation driven by weather in 2018 compared to 2017) and a decrease in other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments).
•   defined benefit plan funding was $31 million higher in 2018.
•   the decrease in cash from ku's other operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in aro expenditures and an increase in other assets (primarily due to noncurrent regulatory asset increases as a result of significant storm activity).
ku had a $28 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016.
•   net income decreased $6 million between the periods and included an increase in net non-cash charges of $42 million. the increase in net non-cash charges was primarily driven by an increase in deferred income tax expense (primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses) and an increase in depreciation expense.
•   the decrease in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due to the timing of payments) and a decrease in accounts payable to affiliates (due to lower intercompany settlements associated with energy purchases and inventory), partially offset by a decrease in fuel purchases (primarily due to lower generation driven by milder weather in 2017 compared to 2016) and an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to the timing of payments).

(a)   the syndicated credit facilities, ku's letter of credit facility and ppl capital funding's bilateral facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for ppl capital funding, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.
the commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: ppl - 11%, ppl electric 7%, lke - 19%, lg&e - 33% and ku - 37%.
(b)   each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does lg&amp;e under its term loan agreement and ku under its letter of credit facility. borrowings generally bear interest at libor-based rates plus an applicable margin.
(c)   the facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its rav, calculated in accordance with the credit facility.
the amounts borrowed at december 31, 2018, include a usd-denominated borrowing of $200 million and gbp-denominated borrowings of £38 million, which equated to $48 million. the unused capacity reflects the usd-denominated amount borrowed in gbp of £156 million as of the date borrowed. at december 31, 2018, the usd equivalent of unused capacity under the u.k. committed credit facilities was $1.1 billion.
the commitments under the u.k.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 13% of the total committed capacity.
in addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. the registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. at december 31, 2018, the registrants were in compliance with these covenants. at this time, the registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

(b)   assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. for ppl, lke, lg&amp;e and ku the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for ppl, payments denominated in british pounds sterling have been translated to u.s. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate.
(c)   see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.
(d)   the amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. primarily includes, as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, natural gas and limestone, as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the capital expenditures table presented above.
(e)   the amounts for ppl include wpd's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed in march 2016. the u.k. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit. the amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2019 for ppl's and lke's u.s. pension plans (for ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku includes their share of these amounts). based on the current funded status of these plans, except for wpd's plans, no cash contributions are required. see note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of expected contributions.

dividends/distributions
(ppl)
ppl views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. in november 2018, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable january 2, 2019, at 41.0 cents per share (equivalent to $1.64 per annum). on february 14, 2019, ppl announced that the company is increasing its common stock dividend to 41.25 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to $1.65 per annum). future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors.
subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 or 2013 series b junior subordinated notes due 2073. at december 31, 2018, no interest payments were deferred.
(ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku)
from time to time, as determined by their respective board of directors, the registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. certain of the credit facilities of ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.
(all registrants)
see note 8 to the financial statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the registrants and their subsidiaries.
purchase or redemption of debt securities the registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. the amounts involved may be material.
rating agency actions moody's and s&p periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the registrants and their subsidiaries. based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the registrants and other sources. the ratings of moody's and s&p are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the registrants or their subsidiaries. such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.
the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. a downgrade in the registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. the registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.
the following table sets forth the registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2018.

the rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the registrants and their subsidiaries.
(ppl)
in march 2018, moody's and s&p assigned ratings of baa1 and a- to wpd (south wales)'s £30 million 0.01% index-linked senior notes due 2036.
in may 2018, moody's and s&p assigned ratings of baa1 and a- to wpd (west midlands)'s £30 million 0.01% index-linked senior notes due 2028.
in october 2018, moody's and s&p assigned ratings of baa3 and bbb+ to wpd plc's £350 million 3.5% senior notes due 2026.
(ppl and ppl electric)
in june 2018, moody's and s&p assigned ratings of a1 and a to ppl electric's $400 million 4.15% first mortgage bonds due 2048.
(ppl, lke and lg&e)
in february 2018, moody's assigned a rating of a1 and s&p confirmed its rating of a to the county of trimble, kentucky's $28 million 2.30% pollution control revenue bonds, 2001 series a (louisville gas and electric company project) due 2026, previously issued on behalf of lg&e.
in april 2018, moody's assigned a rating of a1 and s&p confirmed its rating of a to the county of trimble, kentucky's $35 million 2.55% pollution control revenue bonds, 2001 series b (louisville gas and electric company project) due 2027, previously issued on behalf of lg&e.
in april 2018, moody's assigned a rating of a1 and s&p confirmed its rating of a to the county of jefferson, kentucky's $35 million 2.55% pollution control revenue bonds, 2001 series b (louisville gas and electric company project) due 2027, previously issued on behalf of lg&e.
ratings triggers
(ppl)
as discussed in note 8 to the financial statements, certain of wpd's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (moody's or s&p) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of ba1 or bb+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. a restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which wpd (east
85
midlands), wpd (south west), wpd (south wales) and wpd (west midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. these notes totaled £5.1 billion (approximately $6.5 billion) nominal value at december 31, 2018.
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for ppl), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if ppl's, lke's, lg&e's or ku's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. see note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of "credit risk-related contingent features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for ppl, lke and lg&e for derivative contracts in a net liability position at december 31, 2018.
guarantees for subsidiaries (ppl)
ppl guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. at this time, ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information about guarantees.
off-balance sheet arrangements (all registrants)
the registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of these agreements.
risk management market risk
(all registrants)
see notes 1, 16, and 17 to the financial statements for information about the registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.
the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.
interest rate risk the registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. the registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. in addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.
the following interest rate hedges were outstanding at december 31.

foreign currency risk (ppl)
ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in and earnings of u.k. affiliates. under its risk management program, ppl may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.
the following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at december 31.

(all registrants)
commodity price risk ppl is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.
•   ppl electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a plr. potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its puc-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its plr customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.
•   lg&amp;e's and ku's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. in addition, lg&amp;e's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. these mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.
volumetric risk ppl is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•   wpd is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the u.k. under the riio-ed1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information on revenue recognition under riio-ed1.
•   ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.
defined benefit plans - equity securities price risk see "application of critical accounting policies - defined benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.
credit risk
(all registrants)
credit risk is the risk that the registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. the registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. however, the registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. these concentrations may impact the registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.
(ppl and ppl electric)
in january 2017, the puc issued a final order approving ppl electric's plr procurement plan for the period june 2017 through may 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply semi-annually in april and october. to date, ppl electric has conducted four of its planned eight competitive solicitations.
under the standard supply master agreement (the agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, ppl electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. in the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, ppl electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. all incremental costs incurred by ppl electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. at december 31, 2018, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from s&p, and were not required to post collateral under the agreement. a small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the agreement. there is no instance under the agreement in which ppl electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.
see note 17 to the financial statements for additional information on credit risk.

foreign currency translation (ppl)
the value of the british pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the u.s. dollar. in 2018, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $453 million, which primarily reflected a $754 million decrease to pp&e and $150 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $445 million decrease to long-term debt and a $6 million decrease to other net liabilities. in 2017, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $537 million, which primarily reflected a $935 million increase to pp&e and $198 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $549 million increase to long-term debt and an increase of $47 million to other net liabilities. in 2016, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $1.1 billion, which primarily reflected a $2.1 billion decrease to pp&e and $490 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $208 million to other net liabilities.
(all registrants)
related party transactions the registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the registrants. see note 14 to the financial statements for additional information on related party transactions for ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku.
acquisitions, development and divestitures the registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.
capacity needs (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
as a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, ku anticipates retiring two older coal-fired electricity generating units at the e.w. brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 mw.
(all registrants)
environmental matters extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to ppl's, ppl electric's, lke's, lg&e's and ku's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the registrants' businesses. the cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. in addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the registrants' services. increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. ppl, ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.
see below for further discussion of the epa's ccr rule and note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including: legal matters, naaqs, climate change and elgs. see "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources - forecasted uses of cash - capital expenditures" in "item 7. combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023. see note 19 to the financial statements for information related to the impacts of ccrs on aros.
epa's ccr rule (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
over the next several years, lg&e and ku anticipate undertaking extensive measures, including significant capital expenditures, in complying with the provisions of the epa's ccr rule. although lg&e and ku have identified compliance strategies and are finalizing closure plans and schedules as required by the ccr rule, remaining regulatory uncertainties could

substantially impact current plans. as a result of a judicial settlement, legislative amendments, and the epa's review of the current program, the epa is in the process of undertaking significant revisions to the ccr rule. on july 30, 2018, the epa published certain amendments to the ccr rule which include extending the deadline for commencement of closure of certain impoundments from april 2019 to october 31, 2020. the epa has announced that additional amendments to the rule will be proposed. on august 21, 2018, the d.c. circuit court of appeals vacated and remanded portions of the ccr rule, including the provisions allowing unlined impoundments to continue operating and provisions exempting certain inactive impoundments from regulation. the exact impact of the judicial decision will be highly dependent on the epa's rulemaking actions on remand and any subsequent legal challenges. lg&e and ku are evaluating the specific plan impacts of developments to date and will continue to monitor the epa's ongoing regulatory proceedings.
in connection with the ccr rule, lg&e and ku have recorded adjustments to existing aros beginning in 2015 and continue to record adjustments as required. see note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on aros. lg&e and ku continue to perform technical evaluations related to their plans to close impoundments at all of their generating plants. although lg&e and ku believe their recorded liabilities appropriately reflect their obligations under current rules, changes to current compliance strategies as a result of ongoing regulatory proceedings or other developments could result in additional closure costs. it is not currently possible to determine the magnitude of any potential cost increases related to changes in compliance strategies or plans, and the timing of future cash outflows are indeterminable at this time. as rules are revised, technical evaluations are completed, and the timing and details of impoundment closures develop further on a plant by-plant basis, lg&e and ku will updated their cost estimates and record any changes as necessary to their aro liability, which could be material. these costs are subject to rate recovery.

sustainability increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of "sustainability", which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. these parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. as a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. those efforts remain ongoing. in addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the sec promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "'34 act"), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 act reports. to date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the sec.
as has been ppl's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the registrants' financial condition or results of operation, ppl discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and sec regulations. with respect to other sustainability topics that ppl deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and sec regulation, ppl will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this form 10-k by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this form 10-k. in preparing its sustainability report, ppl is guided by the framework established by the global reporting initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. ppl also participates in efforts by the edison electric institute to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry and responds to the cdp climate survey.

new accounting guidance see note 1 and 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption.
application of critical accounting policies financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. the following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in note 1 to the financial statements). senior management has reviewed with ppl's audit committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.
defined benefits
(all registrants)
certain of the registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. these plans are applicable to certain of the registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). the registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to aoci or, in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully
91
recognized on the balance sheets. see notes 7 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.
a summary of plan sponsors by registrant and whether a registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (s) or participate in and receives allocations (p) from those plans is shown in the table below.

management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. as such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in aoci, or in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. these amounts in aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. the delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. the significant assumptions are:
•   discount rate - the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
•   expected return on plan assets - management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over the life of the plan. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the registrants record currently.
•   rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.
(ppl)
in selecting the discount rate for its u.k. pension plans, wpd starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. these plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. the spot-rate yield curve uses an iboxx british pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. from this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. historically, wpd used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates used to discount the benefit obligation. concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at december 31, 2015, wpd began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost.
an individual bond matching approach, which is used for the u.s. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the u.k. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the u.k. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach.
(all registrants)
in selecting the discount rates for u.s. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. the plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. this bond matching process begins with the full universe of aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.
92
to determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.
in selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.
the following table provides the weighted-average assumptions selected for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at december 31 used to measure current year obligations and subsequent year net periodic defined benefit costs under gaap, as applicable.

(a)   wpd uses individual spot rates from the yield curve used to discount the benefit obligation to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. ppl's u.s. plans use a single discount rate derived from an individual bond matching model to measure the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional details.
a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2018, the defined benefit plans were recorded in the registrants' financial statements as follows.

income taxes (all registrants)
the registrants recognized certain provisional amounts relating to the impact of the enactment of the tcja in their december 31, 2017 financial statements, in accordance with sec guidance. included in those provisional amounts were estimates of: tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, accumulated foreign earnings, foreign tax credits, and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which were based on the interpretation and application of various provisions of the tcja.
in the third quarter of 2018, ppl filed its consolidated federal income tax return, which was prepared using guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department and the irs since the filing of each registrant's 2017 form 10-k. accordingly, the registrants have updated the following provisional amounts and now consider them to be complete: (1) the amount of the deemed dividend and associated foreign tax credits relating to the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings as of december 31, 2017; (2) the amount of accelerated 100% "bonus" depreciation ppl was eligible to claim in its 2017 federal income tax return; and (3) the related impacts on ppl's 2017 consolidated federal net operating loss to be carried forward to future periods. in addition, the registrants recorded the tax impact of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% on
94
the changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the completed provisional amounts. the completed provisional amounts related to the tax rate reduction had an insignificant impact on the net regulatory liabilities of ppl's u.s. regulated operations. in the fourth quarter of 2018, ppl completed its analysis of the deductibility of executive compensation awarded as of november 2, 2017 and concluded that no material change to the provisional amounts is required.
the registrants' accounting related to the effects of the tcja on financial results for the period ended december 31, 2017 is complete as of december 31, 2018 with respect to all provisional amounts.
in 2018, the irs issued proposed regulations for certain provisions of the tcja, including interest deductibility, base erosion anti-avoidance tax (beat), and global intangible low-taxed income (gilti). ppl has determined that the proposed regulations related to beat and gilti do not materially change ppl's current interpretation of the statutory impact of these rules on the company. proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in november 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. these proposed regulations should not apply to the registrants until the year in which the regulations are issued in final form, which is expected to be 2019. it is uncertain what form the final regulations will take and, therefore, the registrants cannot predict what impact the final regulations will have on the tax deductibility of interest expense. however, if the proposed regulations were issued as final in their current form, the registrants could have a limitation on a portion of their interest expense deduction for tax purposes and such limitation could be significant.
significant management judgment is also required in developing the registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested.
additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. the first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. this determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. the second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. the benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.
on a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.
at december 31, 2018, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.
the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
see note 6 to the financial statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the tcja and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested. based on this conclusion, ppl global does not record deferred u.s. federal income taxes on wpd's undistributed earnings.

regulatory assets and liabilities
(all registrants)
ppl electric, lg&e and ku, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. as a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under gaap for non-regulated entities. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.
see note 7 to the financial statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at december 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. all regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.
(ppl)
wpd operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by ofgem. as the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition guidance. see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information.
price risk management (ppl)
see "financial condition - risk management" above, as well as "price risk management" in note 1 to the financial statements.
goodwill impairment (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. ppl has determined its reporting units to be primarily at the same level as its reportable segments. lke, lg&e and ku are individually single operating and reportable segments. a goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.
ppl, lke, lg&e and ku may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. if the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.
when the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, ppl, lke, lg&e and ku determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
96
the second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. that is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.
ppl, lke, lg&e and ku elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2018. management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, outcomes of future rate filings, and projected operating and capital cash flows. projected operating and capital cash flows is based on the registrants' internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future. significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector market performance and comparable transactions.
ppl's goodwill was $3.2 billion at december 31, 2018, which primarily consists of $2.4 billion related to the acquisition of wpd and $662 million related to the acquisition of lke. the goodwill balances of lke, lg&e and ku at december 31, 2018 were $996 million, $389 million and $607 million. applying an appropriate weighting to both the discounted cash flow and market multiple valuations for the most recent impairment tests performed as of october 1, 2018 did not require the second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment.
a high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to fair value conclusions. a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units.
asset retirement obligations (ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
aro liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. the initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. an aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated. an equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. for lke, lg&e and ku, all aro accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. aro regulatory assets associated with certain ccr projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. for other aros, at the time of retirement, the related aro regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, pp&e and aro liability.
see note 7 and note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on aros.
in determining aros, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the aro was incurred. changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the aro. any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.

at december 31, 2018, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded aros were as follows.

revenue recognition - unbilled revenues (lke, lg&e and ku)
revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. for lg&e and ku, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. the unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. see "unbilled revenues" on the registrants' balance sheets for balances at december 31, 2018 and 2017.

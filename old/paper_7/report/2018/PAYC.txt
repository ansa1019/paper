item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap")) and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (this "form 10-k"). the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. see part i "special note regarding forward-looking statements" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with those statements. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward- looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10-k, particularly in the section entitled "risk factors." unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to paycom software, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
overview we are a leading provider of comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") software delivered as software-as-a-service. we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources management applications. our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their hcm activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
we generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period.  we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us.  our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees, which is either weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly.  our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives who sell new applications to existing clients.
we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. none of our clients constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018.   we stored data for over 4.1 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended december 31, 2018.
our continued growth depends on the introduction of new applications to our existing client base while targeting a high degree of client employee usage across those applications, attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets.  during the year ended december 31, 2018, we opened new sales offices in salt lake city, utah, rochester, new york, columbus, ohio and san diego, california.  the opening of these four new sales offices brings our total number of sales teams to 49 sales teams located in 26 states.  we plan to open additional sales offices in the future to further expand our presence in the u.s. market.  we also plan to relocate our texas operations to a new, expanded facility in grapevine, texas, with construction scheduled to begin in the first half of 2019.  our principal marketing efforts include email campaigns, social and digital media, search engine marketing methods, tradeshows and outbound marketing including television and print advertising.  in addition, we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content, such as white papers, blogs, podcast episodes and webinars.
during the last three years, we have developed several new applications.  we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth over the last three years.
growth outlook, opportunities and challenges based on our total revenues, we have grown at a 39% compound annual growth rate from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2018.  as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion since our initial public offering in april 2014, we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges.  our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications.  consequently, we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications, although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new non-payroll applications to our solution.  we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to long-term client satisfaction and client retention. client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth, and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend, in part, on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage. moreover, in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results, we must also attract new clients.  we intend to obtain new clients by (i) continuing to leverage our salesforce productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices, (ii) expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales
27
teams or offices, thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets, and (iii) opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas.
our target client size range is 50 to 5,000 employees.  while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations, increased the number of applications we offer and experienced traction with larger companies.  our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients. we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of potential clients and to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us.  because we charge our clients on a per-employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees at our clients will have a positive or negative impact, respectively, on our results of operations.  we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market.
throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. as the hcm needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to gain additional share of the hcm spending of our clients, and we believe this opportunity is significant. to be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel.
growing our business has resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investments in sales professionals, operating expenses, system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which have and will continue to increase our expenses.  specifically, our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount, which in turn precipitates an increase in (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and (iii) facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters, operations facilities and additional sales office leases.
we believe the challenges of managing the ever-changing complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs. the hcm industry historically has been driven, in part, by legislation and regulatory action, including cobra, changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules, and legislation from federal, state or municipal taxation authorities. the implementation of the affordable care act (the "aca") is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry.  we generate aca-related revenues (i) on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and (ii) from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed, bundled price charged per billing period.  while we generally do not track our revenues on an application-by-application basis (because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price), we estimate that, if the aca is not modified or repealed, revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 4% of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31, 2019.
for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our gross margins were approximately 84%, 83% and 84%, respectively.  although our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends, we expect our gross margins will remain relatively constant in future periods.
key metrics in addition to the u.s. gaap and non-gaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business:
year ended december 31,

2018                   2017                    2016
key performance indicators:
clients                                               23,533                  20,591                  17,817
clients (based on parent company grouping)            12,754                  11,111                  10,464
sales teams                                               49                      45                      42
annual revenue retention rate                             92    %                 91    %                 91   %
•   clients. when we calculate the number of clients at period end, we treat client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers as separate clients, which often separates client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients to provide an accurate gauge of the size of our business. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to clients throughout this form 10-k refer to this metric.

•   clients (based on parent company grouping). when we calculate the number of clients based on parent company grouping at period end, we combine client accounts that have identified the same person(s) as their decision-maker regardless of whether the client accounts have separate taxpayer identification numbers, which often combines client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients based on parent company grouping to provide an alternate measure of the size of our business and clients.

28
•   sales teams. we monitor our sales professionals by the number of sales teams at period end. each team consists of a sales manager and approximately six to eight sales professionals. certain larger metropolitan areas can support more than one sales team. we believe the number of sales teams is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods.

•   annual revenue retention rate. our annual revenue retention rate tracks the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing clients. we monitor this metric because it is an indicator of client satisfaction and revenues for future periods.

components of results of operations sources of revenues revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect our mix of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant.
recurring revenues recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. these revenues are derived from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us.  our billing period varies by client based on when they pay their employees, which is done either weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly.  because recurring revenues are based, in part, on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees.  recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered.
recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms, such as form w-2 and form 1099, and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. because payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients have been subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter, first quarter revenues and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters. we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca (or replacement legislation) includes employer reporting requirements.  in addition, we often experience increased revenues during the fourth quarter due to unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year. therefore, we expect the seasonality of our revenue cycle to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our non-payroll applications.
beginning april 1, 2016, recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients.  we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients.  the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates.
implementation and other revenues implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services. non-refundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients. these fees range from 10% to 30% of the annualized value of the transaction.  implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client, which is estimated to be ten years, and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks. implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 1.6% and 1.8% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications, hardware costs, systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization. these costs include employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) and other expenses related to client support, bank charges for processing ach transactions, certain implementation expenses, delivery charges and paper costs. they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems. the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations.
29
administrative expenses administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff (such as the amortization of commissions and bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), marketing expenses and other related costs. research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) for our development staff, net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software. we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications. general and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. depreciation and amortization expenses consist of (i) the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses (based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling, general and administrative functions) and (ii) amortization of intangible assets.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on debt related to our corporate headquarters and settlements related to an interest rate swap we entered into in connection with such debt.
other income, net other income, net includes interest earned on our own funds, any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets, costs associated with the early repayment of debt and any unrealized gain or loss related to our interest rate swap.  prior to april 1, 2016, other income, net also included interest earned on funds held for clients.
provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.

revenues the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 from the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of (i) the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices, which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months, and in sales offices that reached maturity in 2018, (ii) contributions from new sales offices opened in 2017 that were progressing to maturity during 2018, (iii) the sale of additional applications to our existing clients, (iv) the strong performance of our tax forms filing business and (v) higher average interest rates earned on funds held for clients.
the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 from the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily the result of the recognition of additional non-refundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up.  these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the ten-year estimated life of our clients.
the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of (i) the addition of new clients in mature sales offices, (ii) contributions from the six new sales offices opened in 2016 that were progressing to maturity during 2017, (iii) the sale of additional applications to our existing clients, (iv) the strong performance of our tax forms filing business and (v) growth in our clients' employee headcounts as a result of favorable economic conditions. nonetheless, the magnitude of the increases in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 was offset, in part, due to the impact of hurricanes in texas and florida in august and september. in particular, we experienced some disruption to our prospecting and conversion efforts in the affected areas as well as implementation delays for new clients.
the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of the recognition of additional non-refundable conversion fees that are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up.  these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the ten-year estimated life of our clients.

expenses cost of revenues the increase in cost of revenues of $18.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to an $8.9 million increase in operating expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel, a $4.7 million increase in shipping and automated clearing house fees related to the year-over-year increase in revenues and a $0.1 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.  depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.9 million, or 52%, primarily due to placing our fourth headquarters building in service in june 2018, the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets.
the increase in cost of revenues of $18.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $12.2 million increase in employee-related expenses, which consisted of a $10.5 million increase in expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel and a $1.7 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. additionally, shipping fees and ach fees increased $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in connection with increased sales. depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.8 million, or 65%, primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets, particularly with respect to the new headquarters building that was not in service for the entire prior year period.
administrative expenses sales and marketing during the year ended december 31, 2018, sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by $33.0 million due to a $23.7 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions, bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation, and a $9.3 million increase in marketing and advertising expense, primarily due to a national advertising campaign executed in the second half of 2018.  the increase in employee-related expenses included a $2.5 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by $25.5 million due to a $21.3 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions, bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation, and a $4.2 million increase in marketing and advertising expense.  the increase in employee-related expenses included a $2.0 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
research and development during the year ended december 31, 2018, research and development expenses increased from the prior year due to a $15.8 million increase in employee-related expenses, including a $1.1 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, research and development expenses increased from the prior year due to a $9.5 million increase in employee-related expenses, including a $1.1 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
as we continue to develop our platform and product offerings, we generally expect research and development expenses (exclusive of stock-based compensation) to continue to increase, particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth. while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues, we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale.

during the year ended december 31, 2018, our non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased $0.4 million from the prior year primarily due to the issuance and subsequent accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions during the first quarter of 2018, which exceeded expenses associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions in 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, our non-cash stock-based compensation expense increased $15.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the vesting of restricted stock with market-based vesting conditions and the issuance of restricted stock with a higher grant-date fair value than shares issued in the prior year.
depreciation and amortization during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the respective comparable prior year periods primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other assets, particularly with respect to the timing of new buildings and a parking garage that were placed in service in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
33
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 decreased $0.1 million from the prior year primarily due to increased capitalized interest related to the construction of our fourth headquarters building in the first half of 2018.  interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 decreased $0.1 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to the construction of our third and fourth headquarters buildings during 2017.
other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2018, other income, net increased from the prior year by $2.8 million due primarily to the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swap and the loss on early repayment of debt which occurred in 2017.  for the year ended december 31, 2017, other income, net decreased $1.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to a $0.9 million loss on early repayment of debt and a $0.6 million unrealized loss recognized on the fair value of an interest rate swap.
provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2018, income tax expense increased $33.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.  income tax expense in 2017 was lower due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act") and recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards due to the vesting of various market-based stock awards during 2017.  as a result of the tax act, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future rates.  this remeasurement, as adjusted for the adoption of asu 2014-09, resulted in a $24.9 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $45.7 million and $46.1 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of demand deposit accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit. we also have the ability to borrow funds pursuant to a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "facility") in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million, which may be increased up to $100.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions.  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months.
we have historically financed our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing. although we have funded most of the costs for ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters from available cash, we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs.  further, all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were funded from available cash.
recent liquidity developments term credit agreement.  on december 7, 2017, we entered into a senior secured term credit agreement ("term credit agreement"), pursuant to which jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., bank of america, n.a. and kirkpatrick bank have agreed to make certain term loans to us (the "term loans") from time to time during the period beginning december 7, 2017 and ending september 7, 2018 (the "term loan draw expiration date") in an aggregate principal amount of up to $60.0 million. on september 12, 2018, we entered into the first amendment to the term credit agreement (the "amendment") dated effective as of september 7, 2018, which extended the term loan draw expiration date to march 7, 2019.  as of december 31, 2018, our indebtedness of $34.4 million consisted solely of term loans made under the term credit agreement.
there was $24.5 million of borrowing capacity remaining under the term credit agreement as of december 31, 2018.  our obligations under the term loans are secured by a mortgage and first priority security interest in our headquarters property.  term loans made after december 7, 2017 may be used to finance hard and soft costs related to the completion of construction of our fourth headquarters building and any landscaping, groundwork, parking lots and roads reasonably incidental thereto. the term loans mature on september 7, 2025 and bear interest, at our option, at either (a) a prime rate plus 1.0% or (b) an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such term loan plus 1.5%. the adjusted libor rate is equal to (i) the libor rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by (ii) the statutory reserve rate (equal to (x) one divided by (y) one minus the aggregate of the maximum reserve percentage (including any marginal, special, emergency or supplemental reserves) established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system of the united states).
under the term credit agreement, we are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 and a funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio of not greater than 2.0 to 1.0. additionally, the term credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into certain transactions, including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit agreement of this size and type.  as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the term credit agreement.
34
in connection with entering into the term credit agreement, we also entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans (the "interest rate swap agreement").  the interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of september 7, 2025, provides that we will receive quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate.  we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and, as such, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of income.  for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a gain of $0.7 million and a loss of $0.6 million, respectively, for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap, which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of income.
revolving credit agreement.  on february 12, 2018, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement") with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and bank of america, n.a. which provides for the facility in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million, which may be increased to up to $100.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions. the facility includes a $5.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $2.5 million sublimit for letters of credit.  the facility is scheduled to mature on february 12, 2020. borrowings under the facility will generally bear interest at a prime rate plus 1.0% or, at our option, an adjusted libor rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 1.5%, in each case subject to certain conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreement. the revolving credit agreement also contains financial and non-financial covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the term credit agreement described above. the proceeds from the loans under the facility are to be used for working capital and general business purposes.  letters of credit are to be used to support our business operations.  as of december 31, 2018, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the facility. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the revolving credit agreement.
stock repurchase plan.  in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including rule 10b5-1 programs. since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan, our board of directors has amended and extended the stock repurchase plan from time to time. on february 13, 2018, we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100.0 million of common stock. most recently, on november 20, 2018, we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $150.0 million of our common stock.  our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repurchased an aggregate of 1,108,885 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $125.4 million, including 186,165 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock, as discussed below.  as of december 31, 2018, there was $162.0 million available for repurchases.  the stock repurchase plan will expire on november 19, 2020.
withholding shares to cover taxes.  during the year ended december 31, 2018, we withheld 186,165 shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to the delivery of vested shares of restricted stock to certain employees.  our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in a cash expenditure of $20.2 million and, as such, we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan.
cash flow analysis our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenues received but deferred, our investments in sales and marketing initiatives to drive growth, and research and development. our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.
as our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. although we completed construction of our fourth headquarters building in the second quarter of 2018, we are now focused on the planning and design of our new texas operations facility in grapevine, texas.  capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility are expected to begin in the first half of 2019.  for the year ending december 31, 2019, we expect capital expenditures, as a percentage of total revenues, to be consistent with capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2018.  depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business.
as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds from our clients for federal, state and local employment taxes, which we remit to the appropriate tax authorities. we invest these funds in money market funds, demand deposit accounts,
35
commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement.
our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendars, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle.
our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees.
the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients.  cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnel-related expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business.  these payments included costs of operations, advertising and other sales and marketing efforts, it infrastructure development, product research and development and security and administrative costs.  compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018 were positively impacted by the growth of our business.
investing activities cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased from the prior year period due to the impact of $417.5 million of changes in funds held for clients and a $14.3 million increase in proceeds from maturities of short-term investments from funds held for clients, partially offset by a $78.8 million increase in purchases of short-term investments from funds held for clients and a $0.5 million increase in cash used for purchases of property and equipment primarily related to the  development of additional technology and purchases of other assets.

we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth. in addition, many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. when applicable, our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew.
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described below. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services. substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients. sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues.
recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking, candidate tracker, background check, on-boarding, e-verify and tax credit services applications. time and labor management includes time and attendance, scheduling/schedule exchange, time-off requests, labor allocation, labor management reports/push reporting and geofencing/geotracking. payroll includes our payroll and tax management,
37
paycom pay, expense management, garnishment management and gl concierge applications. talent management includes our employee self-service, compensation budgeting, performance management, executive dashboard and paycom learning and course content applications. hr management includes our document and task management, government and compliance, benefits administration, cobra administration, personnel action forms, surveys and enhanced aca applications.
the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client's payroll period, with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client's payroll. recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client's payroll period, when each respective payroll client is billed. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client's payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer, which minimizes the default risk.
the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days' notice of termination. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications.  for clients who purchase multiple applications, due to the short-term nature of our contracts, we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own, individual, performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application.  similarly, we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application.  we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price, as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups.
implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues, they represent distinct performance obligations.
implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and, for accounting recognition purposes, do not represent services transferred to the client.  however, the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client's option to renew at the end of each 30-day contract period. further, given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price, coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients, the standalone selling price of the client's option to renew approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee.  the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client's first invoice, and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period (i.e. the ten-year estimated client life).
revenue from the sale of time clocks is recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product. we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. if impairment exists, a write-down to fair value is recorded. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date and determined there was no impairment as of june 30, 2018. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no indicators of impairment. intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
restricted stock we measure non-cash stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant.  we determine the fair value of stock awards issued by using a monte carlo simulation model.  this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs, and represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities, the historical volatility of our stock price, risk-free rates and expected life.  the valuation model also
38
incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data.  determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock awards and the associated compensation expense.  refer to note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock-based compensation awards.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.
non-gaap financial measures management uses adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. we define (i) adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, loss on early repayment of debt, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and (ii) non-gaap net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations, loss on early repayment of debt and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.  we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-gaap financial measures to supplement results under u.s. gaap.  in addition, adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, repurchasing common stock and other purposes.  management believes that the non-gaap measures presented in this form 10-k, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are not measures of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider adjusted ebitda or non-gaap net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.

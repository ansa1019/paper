news and information services revenue at the news and information services segment is derived primarily from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues. advertising revenues at the news and information services segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the companys second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the companys and/or competitors products, as well as by promotional activities.
41
operating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions and radio sports rights. selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
the news and information services segments advertising volume and rates, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the companys operating results and cash flow. the company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume and rates, circulation and paper prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. the company continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. the companys expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including tariffs or other restrictions on non-u.s. paper suppliers. the news and information services segments products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. the success of these products also depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics.
the companys traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. the company is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move in advertising from print to digital. these alternative media formats could impact the companys overall performance, positively or negatively. in addition, technologies have been and will continue to be developed that allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact advertising rates or revenues.
as a multi-platform news provider, the company recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital products. smartphones, tablets and similar devices, their related applications, and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the company to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes, and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. the company continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms.
book publishing the book publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, childrens and religious books in the u.s. and internationally. the revenues and operating results of the book publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. the book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. this marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms and distribution channels, and other factors. each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.
major new title releases represent a significant portion of the book publishing segments sales throughout the fiscal year. print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. in the domestic and international markets, the book publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. operating expenses for the book publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.
42
digital real estate services the digital real estate services segment generates revenue through property and property-related advertising and services, including the sale of real estate listing products to agents, brokers and developers, display advertising on its residential real estate and commercial property sites and residential property data services to the financial sector. the digital real estate services segment also generates revenue through licenses of certain professional software products on a subscription basis and fees and commissions from referrals generated through its end-to-end digital property search and financing offering and mortgage broking services. significant expenses associated with these sites, services and software solutions include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, broker commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.
consumers are increasingly turning to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. the digital real estate services segments success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals and attractive to its advertisers. the digital real estate services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other real estate and property websites.
subscription video services the companys subscription video services segment consists of (i) its 65% interest in new foxtel and (ii) anc. new foxtel is the largest pay-tv provider in australia, delivering over 200 channels including the leading sports programming content in australia. new foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue.
new foxtel competes for audiences primarily with free-to-air (fta) tv operators in australia, including the three major commercial fta networks and two major government-funded fta broadcasters, as well as other pay-tv operators, iptv providers and subscription video-on-demand services such as fetch tv, netflix, stan, amazon prime video, hayu and mubi.
anc operates the sky news network, australias 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service, and also owns and operates the australia channel iptv service for international markets. revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising.
the most significant operating expenses of the subscription video services segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations, expenses related to cable, satellite, internet and broadband transmission costs and studio and engineering expense. the expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the subscription video services segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of new foxtels local and international sports programming. programming rights associated with a dedicated channel are amortized over twelve months. other expenses include subscriber acquisition costs such as sales costs and marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.
other the other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate strategy group and costs related to the u.k. newspaper matters. the companys strategy group identifies new products and services across the companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and targets and assesses potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions.

revenuesrevenues increased $885 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the revenue increase was primarily due to higher revenues at the subscription video services segment of $510 million resulting in large part from the transaction, which contributed $461 million to the increase. the revenue increase was also attributable to higher revenues of $203 million at the digital real estate services segment, mainly due to increased revenues at both rea group and move, and $122 million at the book publishing segment as a result of strong frontlist and backlist sales in the general books category and $28 million from the sublicensing agreement for j.r.r. tolkiens the lord of the rings trilogy.
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $172 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.
operating expensesoperating expenses increased $374 million, or 8%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 was mainly due to higher operating expenses at the subscription video services segment of $313 million primarily resulting from the transaction and, to a lesser extent, the timing of programming amortization related to the launch of a dedicated national rugby league channel, higher national rugby league programming rights costs and the acquisition of anc. the book publishing segment also contributed $54 million to the increase primarily due to higher costs associated with higher revenues and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense increase of $84 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $324 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses of $147 million at the subscription video services segment, primarily as a result of the transaction, and $108 million at the digital real estate services segment primarily due to higher costs associated with higher revenues, the acquisition of smartline and increased marketing costs at move. the increase was also attributable to higher expenses of $81 million at the news and information services segment primarily related to higher compensation and marketing costs, the $55 million increase from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as the absence of a $12 million adjustment to reduce the deferred consideration accrual related to the acquisition of unruly which did not recur in the current year period. these increases were partially offset by the $46 million impact from the reversal of a portion of the previously accrued liability for the u.k. newspaper matters and the corresponding receivable from 21st century fox as the result of an agreement reached with the relevant tax authority with respect to certain employment taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense increase of $71 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense increased $23 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an additional $78 million of depreciation and amortization expense due to the transaction. the increase was partially offset by lower depreciation expense of $60 million at the news and information services segment, primarily due to the write down of fixed assets at the u.k. and australian newspapers during fiscal 2017.
impairment and restructuring chargesduring the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, the company recorded restructuring charges of $71 million and $142 million, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits in the news and information services segment.
46
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the news america marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the fox sports australia reporting unit.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company recognized total non-cash impairment charges of $785 million, primarily at news uk and news corp australia. the charges consisted of a write-down of the companys fixed assets of $679 million, a write-down of intangible assets of $58 million and a write-down of goodwill of $48 million.
see note 5restructuring programs, note 7property, plant and equipment and note 8goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
equity losses of affiliatesequity losses of affiliates increased $711 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 was primarily due to a $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower-than-expected revenues from certain new products and broadcast subscribers. the increase was partially offset by the absence of the $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

interest, netinterest, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 decreased $46 million, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower interest income due to the repayment of the foxtel shareholder note in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements), higher interest expense as a result of the transaction and the absence of an adjustment of the deferred consideration related to rea groups acquisition of iproperty recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. as a result of the transaction, the company recorded outstanding debt of approximately $1.8 billion. see note 9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 the company recorded a tax expense of $355 million on pre-tax loss of $1,089 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $340 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs of approximately $1.3 billion, $88 million of lower tax benefits related to the $337 million loss for the settlement of the pre-existing contractual arrangement between fox sports australia and foxtel as a result of the transaction and a tax expense of $237 million related to the impact of the tax act, offset by a tax benefit of approximately $49 million related to the settlement of pre-separation tax matters with the internal revenue service.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 the company recorded a tax expense of $28 million on pre-tax loss of $615 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $139 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $1 billion, a tax expense of approximately $63 million related to the settlement of a foreign tax audit and $40 million related to the recording of a valuation allowance against foreign net operating losses, offset by lower taxes on the sale of certain business assets.
net lossnet loss increased $801 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher equity losses of affiliates resulting from the $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel, the loss on the transaction, non-cash impairment charges of approximately $280 million mainly related to news america marketing and fox sports australia and the tax impacts discussed above in fiscal 2018 and the absence of the gain recognized on the sale of rea groups european business in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the absence of the non-cash impairment charges of approximately $785 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. and australian newspapers and the $227 million non-cash write-down of the companys investment in foxtel in the prior year period.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $25 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized on the sale of rea groups european business.
segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax (expense) benefit and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in
48
addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the companys operations and other factors that affect the companys reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods. the following table reconciles net loss to total segment ebitda for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017:

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, revenues at the news and information services segment increased $50 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2017. the revenue increase was primarily due to higher circulation and subscription revenues of $105 million as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2017, mainly due to cover price and subscription price increases, the $53 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, digital subscriber growth, primarily at the wall street journal and in australia, higher professional information business revenues at dow jones and the contribution from the acquisition of arm. these increases were partially offset by lower single-copy sales in the u.k., primarily at the sun, and in australia. advertising revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 decreased $76 million as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads and lower revenues at news america marketing of $75 million. these decreases were partially offset by the $47 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the $42 million and $38 million contributions from the acquisitions of wireless group and arm, respectively, and digital advertising growth, primarily in australia and the u.k. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $119 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment decreased $22 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2017. the decrease was primarily due to the $12 million impact from the absence of the adjustment to reduce the deferred consideration accrual related to the acquisition of unruly in the prior year period.

50
$17 million due to the $13 million contribution from the acquisition of arm and the $12 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were more than offset by the impact of print volume declines. advertising revenues decreased $11 million, primarily as a result of the $80 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market and the $8 million impact from the sale of perth sunday times in november 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of arm, the $19 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and $18 million of digital advertising growth.
news uk revenues were $1,076 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, an increase of $39 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2017 revenues of $1,037 million. advertising revenues increased $16 million, primarily due to the $19 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as weakness in the print advertising market more than offset digital advertising growth. circulation and subscription revenues increased $9 million, primarily due to the $32 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $15 million impact of cover price increases across mastheads, partially offset by the $36 million impact of single-copy volume declines, mainly at the sun. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $63 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
news america marketing revenues at news america marketing were $956 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, a decrease of $65 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2017 revenues of $1,021 million. the decrease was primarily related to lower home delivered revenues of $74 million, mainly due to lower volume and rate and lower custom publishing.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, revenues at the digital real estate services segment increased $203 million, or 22%, as compared to fiscal 2017. at rea group, revenues increased $141 million, or 27%, to $666 million in fiscal 2018 from $525 million in fiscal 2017. the higher revenues were primarily due to a $74 million increase in australian residential depth revenue, the $55 million contribution from the acquisition of smartline and the $18 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the $19 million impact resulting from the sale of rea groups european business in december 2016. revenues at move increased $58 million, or 15%, to $452 million in fiscal 2018 from $394 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $61 million increase in connectionssm for buyers product revenues driven by improvement in yield optimization and growth in leads and customers.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment increased $77 million, or 24%, as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in segment ebitda was the result of higher contributions from rea group and move of $71 million and $5 million, respectively, primarily due to the higher revenues noted above, partially offset by $50 million in higher costs associated with higher revenues, $43 million in broker commissions from the acquisition of smartline and $28 million of higher marketing costs, primarily at move, to drive audience growth.

notes to the unaudited proforma statements:
(a)   reflects the historical results of operations of news corporation. as the acquisition of a controlling interest in foxtel was completed on april 3,
2018, foxtel is reflected in our historical statement of operations from april 3, 2018 onwards.

(b)                                                      reflects the historical results of operations of foxtel to the date of the transaction. from april 3, 2018 onwards, foxtel is included in the historical results of operations of news corporation. the statements of operations of foxtel are derived from its historical financial statements for the nine months ended march 31, 2018 and the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. these statements of operations for the nine months ended march 31, 2018 and the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 reflect foxtels statements of operations on a u.s. gaap basis and translated from australian dollars to u.s. dollars, the reporting currency of the combined group, using the quarterly average rates for each period presented. additionally, certain balances within foxtels historical financial information were reclassified to be consistent with the companys presentation.

(c)   represents the impact of eliminating transactions between foxtel and the consolidated subsidiaries of news corporation, which would be eliminated upon consolidation as a result of the transaction.

(d)   reflects the reversal of revenue recognized in foxtels historical statements of operations resulting from the fair value adjustment of foxtels historical deferred installation revenue in the preliminary purchase price allocation for the transaction.

(e)   reflects the adjustment to amortization of program inventory recognized in foxtels historical statements of operations related to the fair value adjustment of foxtels historical program inventory in the preliminary purchase price allocation.

55
(f)                           reflects the removal of transaction expenses directly related to the transaction that are included in news corps historical statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. these costs are considered to be non-recurring in nature, and as such, have been excluded from the pro forma statement of operations.

(g)   reflects the adjustment to amortization expense resulting from the recognition of amortizable intangible assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation.

(h)   reflects the adjustment to depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustment to foxtels historical fixed assets in the preliminary purchase price allocation, which resulted in a step-up in the value of such assets.

(i)                                 reflects the reversal of amortization expense included in news corps historical statements of operations from the companys settlement of its pre-existing contractual arrangement between foxtel and fox sports australia, which resulted in a write-off of its channel distribution agreement intangible asset at the time of the transaction.

(j)                                                  represents the impact to equity losses of affiliates as a result of the transaction, as if the transaction occurred on july 1, 2016. historically news corp accounted for its investment in foxtel under the equity method of accounting. as a result of the transaction, foxtel became a majority-owned subsidiary of the company, and therefore, the impact of foxtel on the companys historical equity losses of affiliates was eliminated. in addition, news corp previously recorded certain impairments to its investment in foxtel within equity losses of affiliates which are reflected in news corps historical results. as these impairments are not directly attributable to the transaction, such amounts have not been eliminated and have been reclassified in the pro forma statement of operations from equity losses of affiliates into impairment and restructuring charges.

(k)                                                 represents the write-off recorded as a result of the effective settlement of the channel distribution agreement between fox sports australia and foxtel as a result of the transaction as well as other costs directly attributable to the transaction. the write-off of the intangible asset related to this agreement and other associated costs are considered transaction costs directly attributable to the transaction that were incurred in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018.

(l)                                                  in determining the tax rate to apply to our pro forma adjustments we used the australian statutory rate of 30%, which is the jurisdiction in which the business operates. however, in certain instances, the effective tax rate applied to adjustments differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of certain valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, based on the companys historical tax profile in australia.

(m)   represents the adjustment, as a result of the transaction, to reflect the noncontrolling interest of the combined company on a pro forma basis.

**   not meaningful

revenues (pro forma)revenues increased $373 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues of $203 million at the digital real estate services segment, mainly due to increased revenues at both rea group and move, and $122 million at the book publishing segment as a result of strong frontlist and backlist sales in the general books category and $28 million from the sublicensing agreement for j.r.r. tolkiens the lord of the rings trilogy. news and information services segment revenues increased $50 million primarily due to higher circulation and subscription revenues of $105 million primarily due to cover price and subscription price increases, the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and digital subscriber growth, partially offset by lower advertising revenues of $76 million primarily due to weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads and lower revenues at news america marketing of $75 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $244 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
operating expenses (pro forma)operating expenses increased $204 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 was mainly due to higher operating expenses at the subscription video services segment of $143 million primarily resulting from higher sports programming rights costs and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the book publishing segment also contributed $54 million to the increase primarily due to higher costs associated with higher revenues and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense increase of $123 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
selling, general and administrative expenses (pro forma)selling, general and administrative expenses increased $186 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses of $108 million at the
57
digital real estate services segment primarily due to higher costs associated with higher revenues, the acquisition of smartline and increased marketing costs at move. the increase was also attributable to higher expenses of $81 million at the news and information services segment primarily related to higher compensation and marketing costs, the $55 million increase from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as the absence of a $12 million adjustment to reduce the deferred consideration accrual related to the acquisition of unruly which did not recur in the current year period. these increases were partially offset by the $46 million impact from the reversal of a portion of the previously accrued liability for the u.k. newspaper matters and the corresponding receivable from 21st century fox as the result of an agreement reached with the relevant tax authority with respect to certain employment taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense increase of $89 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
depreciation and amortization (pro forma)depreciation and amortization expense decreased $35 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower depreciation expense of $60 million at the news and information services segment, primarily due to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. and australian newspapers during fiscal 2017. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense increase of $79 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.
impairment and restructuring charges (pro forma)during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, the company recorded restructuring charges of $76 million and $151 million, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits in the news and information services segment.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,237 million primarily related to the $957 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel and $280 million primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the news america marketing reporting unit and impairment of goodwill at the fox sports australia reporting unit.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company recognized total non-cash impairment charges of $1,066 million primarily at news uk and news corp australia. the charges consisted of a write-down of the companys fixed assets of $679 million, a write-down of intangible assets of $58 million and a write-down of goodwill of $48 million. the company also recognized a $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel and $53 million related to foxtel managements decision to cease presto operations in fiscal 2017.
see note 5restructuring programs, see note 6investments, note 7property, plant and equipment and note 8goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
equity losses of affiliates (pro forma)equity losses of affiliates improved $55 million to ($27) million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 from ($82) million in fiscal 2017. the decrease in losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 was primarily due to the absence of losses from the companys interest in ten network holdings (ten).
included within losses of affiliates in fiscal 2017 was a $58 million write-down of foxtels investment in ten. during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, foxtel was deemed to have significant influence over its investment in ten. as a result, foxtel was required to treat its investment in ten as an equity investment. foxtel elected the fair value option under asc 825, financial instruments (asc 825) and adjusted the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period. although foxtel ceased to have significant influence in ten during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it continued to adjust the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period due to its election of the fair value option under asc 825.
58
during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, the company recognized non-cash impairments of $13 million and $9 million on certain other equity method investments, respectively. the impairments are reflected in equity losses of affiliates in the statement of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
interest, net (pro forma)interest, net decreased $39 million, or 32%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower interest expense from the repayment of the foxtel shareholder note in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by the absence of an adjustment of the deferred consideration related to rea groups acquisition of iproperty recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
other, net (pro forma)other, net decreased $122 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily related to the absence of the $107 million gain recognized in the prior fiscal year related to rea groups sale of its european business.
income tax (expense) benefit (pro forma)the companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 were $373 million and (58%), respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $31 million and (6%), respectively, for fiscal 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 the company recorded a tax expense of $373 million on pre-tax loss of $645 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $340 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs of approximately $1.3 billion and a tax expense of $237 million related to the impact of the tax act, offset by a tax benefit of approximately $49 million related to the settlement of pre-separation tax matters with the internal revenue service.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 the company recorded a tax expense of $31 million on pre-tax loss of $539 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $139 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $1 billion, a tax expense of approximately $63 million related to the settlement of a foreign tax audit and $40 million related to the recording of a valuation allowance against foreign net operating losses, offset by lower taxes on the sale of certain business assets.
net loss (pro forma)net loss increased $448 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the tax impacts discussed above and lower other, net primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized on the sale of rea groups european business.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (pro forma)net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $29 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized on the sale of rea groups european business.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, revenues at the subscription video services segment decreased $2 million as compared to fiscal 2017. the revenue decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues,

as lower subscription revenues resulting from subscriber mix were more than offset by the $82 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, segment ebitda at the subscription video services segment decreased $154 million, or 22%, as compared to fiscal 2017. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above and higher sports programming costs, primarily for the national rugby league and australian football league and third party transition costs of $10 million.

revenuesrevenues decreased $153 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue decrease was mainly due to a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of $269 million, primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads, the $143 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $77 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. the revenue decrease was partially offset by the acquisitions of wireless group and arm which contributed $74 million and $61 million in revenues, respectively. the decrease in the news and information services segment was partially offset by increased revenues at the digital real estate services segment of $116 million, primarily as a result of higher revenues at both rea group and move.
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $147 million and $112 million, respectively, for the fiscal

year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.
operating expensesoperating expenses decreased $199 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 was mainly due to a decrease in operating expenses at the news and information services segment of $199 million, primarily as a result of the impact of cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production, and distribution costs and a $74 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher costs of $75 million associated with the acquisitions of arm and wireless group. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of $59 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
selling, general and administrative expensesselling, general and administrative expenses increased $3 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher expenses at the news and information services segment of $10 million, mainly due to $56 million in higher costs associated with the acquisitions of wireless group and arm, and $19 million in higher costs at news america marketing, primarily due to a $12 million increase in investment spending at checkout 51, partially offset by the $63 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the increase was also attributable to a one-time corporate charge of $11 million associated with a change in the companys executive management in february 2017. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling, general and administrative expense decrease of $87 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
nam group and zillow settlements, netduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recognized one-time costs of approximately $280 million in connection with the settlement of certain litigation and related claims at news america marketing and a one-time gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, inc. (zillow). the gain reflects settlement proceeds received from zillow of $130 million, less $8 million paid to the national association of realtors® (nar). see note 16commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expense decreased $56 million, or 11%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the write-down of fixed assets at the australian newspapers in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $9 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
impairment and restructuring chargesduring the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 and 2016, the company recorded restructuring charges of $142 million and $89 million, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company recognized total impairment charges of $785 million, primarily at news uk and news corp australia. the total charges consisted of a write-down of the companys fixed assets of $679 million, a write-down of intangible assets of $58 million and a write-down of goodwill of $48 million.

(a)                                                                 during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized a $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel to fair value. the write-down is reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) 350, intangiblesgoodwill and other (asc 350), the company amortized $68 million and $52 million related to excess cost over the companys proportionate share of its investments underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. such amortization is reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statements of operations. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. the increase in amortization expense recognized by the company in fiscal 2017 resulted from a corresponding decrease in amortization expense recognized by foxtel as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, foxtel revenues increased $32 million, or 1%, as a result of the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as revenues decreased 2% in local currency due to lower subscribers. operating income decreased $20 million, primarily due to planned increases in programming spend and the lower revenues noted above, partially offset by lower depreciation costs and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. net income decreased $121 million, mainly due to $58 million in losses associated with the change in the fair value of foxtels investment in ten network holdings (ten) and losses of $53 million associated with presto, primarily resulting from foxtel managements decision to cease presto operations in january 2017. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, foxtel was deemed to have significant influence over its investment in ten. as a result, foxtel was required to treat its investment in ten as an equity method investment. foxtel elected the fair value option under asc 825, financial instruments (asc 825) and adjusts the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period. although foxtel ceased to have significant influence in ten during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, it will continue to adjust the carrying value of the ten investment to fair value each reporting period due to its election of the fair value option under asc 825. this adjustment will be recorded as a component of foxtels net income.

additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized impairments of $9 million on certain other equity method investments. the impairments are reflected in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. see note 6investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

interest, netinterest, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 decreased $4 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense associated with the rea facility. see note 9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

other, netother, net increased $114 million for the fiscal year ended 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016. see note 21additional financial information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
income tax (expense) benefitthe companys income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 were $28 million and (5%), respectively, as compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $54 million and (30%), respectively, for fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 the company recorded a tax expense of $28 million on pre-tax loss of $615 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to $139 million of lower tax benefits on impairments and write-downs in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $1 billion, a tax expense of approximately $63 million related to the settlement of a foreign tax audit and $40 million related to the recording of valuation allowance against foreign net operating losses, offset by lower taxes on the sale of certain business assets.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded a tax benefit of $54 million on pre-tax income of $181 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. the lower tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to certain u.s. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. this benefit was recognized in conjunction with managements plan to dispose of the companys digital education business in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as the company now expects to generate sufficient u.s. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration. in addition, the effective tax rate was also impacted by the $29 million non-taxable gain resulting from the revaluation of rea groups previously held equity interest in iproperty. see note 19income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxfor the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, the company did not recognize any income from discontinued operations as the operations of the digital education business were discontinued during fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, the company recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $15 million. the income recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impact of a $144 million tax benefit recognized upon reclassification of the digital education segment to discontinued operations, a tax benefit of $30 million related to the operations for the period and lower operating losses as a result of the sale of amplify insight and amplify learning, which more than offset the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $76 million and $17 million in severance and lease termination charges recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 4discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
net (loss) incomenet (loss) income decreased $893 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of approximately $785 million, mainly related to the write-down of fixed assets at the u.k. and australian newspapers, higher equity losses of affiliates, primarily due to the $227 million non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the companys investment in foxtel to fair value, the absence of the one-time gain of $122 million in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow, and the tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances and income from discontinued operations recognized in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the absence of the $280 million nam group settlement charge in the prior year and higher other, net.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $24 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, due to the gain on the sale of rea groups european business.

segment analysis segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses and excluding impact from the nam group and zillow legal settlements. segment ebitda does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax (expense) benefit and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of segment ebitda.
segment ebitda is the primary measure used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the companys businesses. segment ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the companys business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).
total segment ebitda is a non-gaap measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net (loss) income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance. the company believes that the presentation of total segment ebitda provides useful information regarding the companys operations and other factors that affect the companys reported results. specifically, the company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the company believes are not representative of its core business. as a result, users of the companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the company across different periods. the following table reconciles net loss to total segment ebitda for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016:

**not meaningful for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the news and information services segment decreased $269 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue decrease was mainly due to lower advertising revenues of $202 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market across mastheads, the $33 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, the $28 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower advertising revenues of $16 million from the perth sunday times which was sold in november 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisitions of wireless group and arm, which contributed $63 million and $42 million of advertising revenues, respectively. circulation and subscription revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 decreased $97 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the $88 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $39 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, which more than offset higher circulation and subscription revenues at dow jones. other revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 increased $30 million as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher brand partnership revenues in the u.k. of $14 million, higher third-party printing revenues in australia of $10 million and the acquisitions of wireless group and unruly, which contributed $11 million and $8 million, respectively, to the increase. these increases were partially offset by the $27 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $143 million and $77 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the news and information services segment increased $200 million, or 93%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the absence of the $280 million nam group settlement charge in the prior year and the $12 million impact of an adjustment to the deferred consideration accrual related to the acquisition of unruly. these factors were partially offset by lower
66
contributions from news corp australia, news uk and dow jones of $44 million, $36 million and $22 million, respectively, primarily due to the impact of lower advertising revenues as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production, editorial and distribution costs.
news corp australia revenues at the australian newspapers were $1,271 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $21 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,292 million. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in a revenue increase of $43 million, or 3%, and a revenue decrease of $21 million, or 2%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. advertising revenues decreased $46 million, primarily as a result of the $94 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market, lower advertising revenues of $16 million from the perth sunday times, which was sold in november 2016, and the $14 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of arm, which contributed $42 million to advertising revenues, and the $25 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. circulation and subscription revenues increased $7 million due to the $14 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and $13 million from the acquisition of arm, partially offset by lower circulation and subscription revenues of $10 million primarily from the perth sunday times and the $7 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, as price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by print volume declines. other revenues increased $18 million primarily due to higher third-party printing revenues.
news uk revenues were $1,037 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $244 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,281 million. advertising revenues decreased $114 million, primarily due to the $52 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $51 million impact from weakness in the print advertising. circulation and subscription revenues decreased $111 million, primarily due to the $96 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $13 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, as the $33 million impact of single-copy volume declines, primarily at the sun, was offset by the $32 million impact of cover price increases across the sun and the times. other revenues decreased $19 million due to the $29 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset higher brand partnership revenues. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies and the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 resulted in revenue decreases of $177 million and $21 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
dow jones revenues were $1,479 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, a decrease of $91 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,570 million. advertising revenues decreased $103 million, primarily due to the $95 million impact of weakness in the print advertising market. circulation and subscription revenues increased $9 million, primarily due to the $38 million impact of price increases and volume growth at the wall street journal, partially offset by the $19 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 and the $6 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as professional information business revenues were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016. the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against local currencies resulted in revenue decreases of $26 million and $6 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
news america marketing revenues at news america marketing were $1,021 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, an increase of $9 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016 revenues of $1,012 million. the increase was primarily due to

higher other revenues of $9 million related to certain merchandising products. advertising revenues were flat, as higher domestic in-store product revenues of $42 million and certain other increases were offset by lower home delivered revenues, which include free-standing insert products, of $51 million.

**not meaningful for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the book publishing segment decreased $10 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease was mainly due to the absence of $42 million in sales of go set a watchman by harper lee, the $34 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the $19 million impact from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by strong frontlist and backlist sales in the general books category, which increased $43 million, including hillbilly elegy by j.d. vance, and in the christian publishing category, which increased $24 million, including the magnolia story by chip and joanna gaines and jesus calling and jesus always by sarah young, as well as the $25 million impact of the continued expansion of harpercollins global footprint. digital sales represented 19% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 and were flat as compared to fiscal 2016.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the book publishing segment increased $14 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the mix of titles as compared to the prior year.

$525 million in fiscal 2017 from $459 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to a $45 million increase in australian residential depth revenue and the $18 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by an $18 million decrease resulting from the sale of rea groups european business in december 2016. revenues at move increased $37 million, or 10%, to $394 million in fiscal 2017 from $357 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to a $38 million increase in connectionssm for buyers product revenues and a $12 million increase in non-listing media revenues, partially offset by the $12 million impact of lower revenues from tigerlead® , which was sold in november 2016. the acquisition of diakrit also contributed $13 million to the revenue increase for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the digital real estate services segment decreased $20 million, or 6%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in segment ebitda was the result of the $63 million lower contribution from move, primarily due to the absence of the $122 million gain recognized in connection with the settlement of litigation with zillow in fiscal 2016 and $11 million of increased marketing costs to drive traffic growth and brand awareness, partially offset by the higher revenues noted above and the absence of $36 million of legal costs, primarily related to the zillow litigation. the decrease was partially offset by the $46 million higher contribution from rea group, primarily due to the higher revenues noted above, the $11 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the absence of $12 million of costs associated with rea groups european business, which was disposed of in fiscal 2017, partially offset by $16 million in higher costs associated with higher revenues and $14 million in higher costs related to the acquisition of iproperty.

for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, revenues at the subscription video services segment increased $10 million, or 2% as compared to fiscal 2016. the revenue increase was primarily due to the acquisition of anc, which contributed $20 million of revenue in fiscal 2017 and the $12 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. these increases were partially offset by lower affiliate revenues of $11 million at fox sports australia and the $10 million impact of the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, segment ebitda at the subscription video services segment decreased $1 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in segment ebitda was due to the $3 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as the impact of lower revenues at fox sports australia were offset by lower programming rights costs.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the companys principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. as of june 30, 2018, the companys cash and cash equivalents were $2,034 million. the company expects these
69
elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future, including repayment of indebtedness. the company also has available borrowing capacity under the facility (as defined below) and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. although the company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the performance of the company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the companys credit rating or absence of a credit rating and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable, (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents, (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and (v) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurances that the company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. see part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion.
as of june 30, 2018, the companys consolidated assets included $887 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. $86 million of this amount is cash not readily accessible by the company as it is held by rea group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. rea group must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea groups cash balance. the company earns income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. the company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings. should the company require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and taxes. additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the company. the tax act was enacted on december 22, 2017. as part of the transition to the new partial territorial tax system, the tax act imposes a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries. it is estimated that the deemed repatriation tax will be approximately $26 million, which was recorded to income tax expense. the estimate may change, possibly materially, due to among other things, further refinement of the companys calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the tax act.
the principal uses of cash that affect the companys liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs and paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities and acquisitions. in addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the companys securities or the assumption of indebtedness.
issuer purchases of equity securities in may 2013, the companys board of directors (the board of directors) authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its class a common stock. no stock repurchases were made during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. through august 7, 2018, the company cumulatively repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. the remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of august 7, 2018 was approximately $429 million. all decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the board of directors and management. the committees decisions regarding future stock repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. the stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the board of directors and the board of directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.
70
dividends in august 2017, the board of directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for class a common stock and class b common stock. this dividend was paid on october 18, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on september 13, 2017. in february 2018, the board of directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for class a common stock and class b common stock. this dividend was paid on april 18, 2018 to stockholders of record as of march 14, 2018. the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the board of directors. the board of directors decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation free cash flow available to news corporation is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, less capital expenditures (free cash flow), less rea group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from rea group. free cash flow available to news corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations. free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap. free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.
the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the companys balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the companys business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. the company believes excluding rea groups free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company, as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea groups cash balance. the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the companys free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group, which has generally been lower than the companys unadjusted free cash flow.
a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period.

free cash flow available to news corporation increased $136 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 to $249 million from $113 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher cash provided by continuing operating activities as discussed above, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
free cash flow available to news corporation decreased $497 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 to $113 million from $610 million in fiscal 2016. the decrease was primarily due to lower cash provided by continuing operating activities as discussed above, as well as higher rea group free cash flow.

(a)   the company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.

(b)                                                     the company has sports programming rights commitments with national rugby league, australian football league, cricket australia, the domestic football league, and australian rugby union as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2024. in april 2018, new foxtel entered into a sports programming rights agreement with cricket australia to broadcast domestic cricket for a six year period from 2018 to 2024. the sports rights commitments are included in the table above. the company expects to incur approximately $75 million for the domestic cricket rights and other related expenses in fiscal 2019.

(c)   the company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.

(d)                                         the company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite service agreements and equipment. these leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2062. this amount includes approximately $175 million of land and office facilities that have been subleased from 21st century fox.

(e)   the company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. the transponder services arrangements extend through 2029 and are accounted for as operating leases.

(f)   see note 9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(g)   reflects the companys expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at june 30, 2018. such rates are subject to change in future periods. see note 9borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the companys total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.
the table also excludes the companys pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (opeb) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. the company made contributions of $29 million and $26 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. future plan
75
contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $17 million in fiscal 2019, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the companys expected returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. payments due to participants under the companys pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the companys opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the companys opeb plans. the company expects its opeb payments to approximate $9 million in fiscal 2019. see note 17retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
contingencies the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. see note 16commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the companys tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the companys tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the companys financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company. see note 2summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
long-lived assets the companys long-lived assets include goodwill, finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.
76
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company early adopted asu 2017-04, intangiblesgoodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04) which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and instead requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value. under asu 2017-04, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. however, if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. in performing the valuation, the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach methodologies.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as part of the companys long-range planning process, the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.
the performance of the companys annual impairment analysis resulted in $43 million of impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2018. significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 8.5%-25.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from (1.0%)-3.0%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.5%-7.5%). significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums of 10%.
significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.
77
the fair values of the companys reporting units in fiscal 2018 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0% to 45%. no material impairments were identified. any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment failing the 2018 impairment analysis, which would have required the company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value. the news and information services segment has a reporting unit with goodwill of approximately $170 million at june 30, 2018 that is at-risk for future impairment. the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.
property, plant and equipment the company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable, in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment (asc 360). an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include, among other things, material declines in operating performance, significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group.
in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group. the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance, market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset. if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be non-recoverable, the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset groups carrying value and its fair value. the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. typical assumptions applied when using a market-based approach include projected ebitda and related multiples. typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results.
programming costs costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, entertainmentbroadcasters. program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. programming costs are amortized over the license period or expected useful life of each program. the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value. any change in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events. the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired. for sports contracts with dedicated channels, the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the companys tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740, income taxes.
78
the companys annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. significant management judgment is required in determining the companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the companys net deferred tax assets, if any. in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. the companys actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. although the company believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. the companys policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit (expense).
retirement benefit obligations the companys employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries. see note 17retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap. the measurement and recognition of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. net periodic benefit costs (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. in developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolios past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 4.7% for fiscal 2019 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 23% equities, 65% fixed-income securities and 12% cash and other investments.
the company recorded $3 million, $1 million, and $8 million in net periodic benefit costs (income) in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in fiscal 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. for fiscal 2016, the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. the new method utilized a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. the change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which was applied prospectively. this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the companys pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods.
79
although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 3.2% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs (income). the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the companys annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the rate was determined by matching the companys expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the u.s., the u.k., australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.
the key assumptions used in developing the companys fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:

the company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 4.7% for 2019 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2018 were approximately $442 million which decreased from approximately $595 million for the companys pension plans as of june 30, 2017. this decrease of $153 million was primarily due to increased discount rates. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the companys deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the companys accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with asc 715, compensationretirement benefits. unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.
the company made contributions of $29 million, $26 million and $26 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the companys expected plan returns in fiscal 2018 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $17 million in fiscal 2019. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. see note 18other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the companys expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the

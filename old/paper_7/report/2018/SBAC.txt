item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in item 1a. risk factors. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. see "special note regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors.
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as "towers" or "sites." our principal operations are in the united states and its territories. in addition, we own and operate towers in south america, central america, and canada. our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.0% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2018. in our site leasing business, we (1) lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. as of december 31, 2018, we owned 29,578 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. we also managed or leased approximately 9,700 actual or potential sites, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31, 2018. our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.
site leasing services our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the united states, canada, central america, and south america. as of december 31, 2018, (1) no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and (2) no u.s. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018. in addition, as of december 31, 2018, approximately 28.9% of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 3% of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets (each country is considered a market). we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including at&t, t-mobile, verizon wireless, sprint, oi s.a., telefonica, claro, and tim. wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site. in the united states and canada, our
24
tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple 5-year renewal periods. in central america, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index. site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent.
ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple 5-year renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2-3% annually, or in our south american markets, adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 71% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. for any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. as such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.
in our central american markets and ecuador, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in u.s. dollars. specifically, most of our ground leases, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are due and paid in u.s. dollars. in our central american markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. in brazil, canada, and chile, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. in colombia, argentina, and peru, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and u.s. dollars.
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:
•rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests;
•property taxes;
•site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);
•utilities;
•property insurance;
•lease origination cost amortization; and
•straight-line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term (which may include renewal terms) of the underlying property interests.
as indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. for information regarding our operating segments, see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

for the year ended segment operating profit as a percentage of total   2018             2017              2016
domestic site leasing                                        81.2%             81.8%             83.6%
international site leasing                                   16.8%             16.9%             15.1%
total site leasing                                           98.0%             98.7%             98.7%
we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology. we believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements. during 2019, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2018 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. furthermore, because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do
25
not relocate, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology (e.g. iden, metropcs, clearwire, and cricket).
site development services    our site development business, which is conducted in the united states only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. the market offices are responsible for all site development operations.    for information regarding our operating segments, see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
capital allocation strategy our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value. a primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our adjusted funds from operations per share. to achieve this, we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases, subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements, available funds and market conditions, while maintaining our target leverage levels. key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:
portfolio growth. we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers.
stock repurchase program. we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value. we believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, with no need for management's judgment in their application. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2018, included herein. our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.  revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five to ten years. receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. revenue from site leasing represents 93% of our total revenue.
26
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates. revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs incurred. amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets.
revenue from construction projects is recognized over time, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management's estimated total cost for each contract. this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. these amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. refer to note 9 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.
the site development segment represents approximately 7% of our total revenues. we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, which was adopted on january 1, 2018 by applying the modified retrospective transition method. payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements. furthermore, these contracts do not typically include variable consideration; therefore, the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract. the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard had no impact on our financial results. the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. the adoption of the new standard had no impact to net income on an ongoing basis.
the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $111.0 million and $90.7 million, respectively, of which $27.1 and $20.8 million related to the site development segment, respectively. we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. in addition, we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. refer to note 18 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases. the standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. the accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from existing guidance. the company has adopted this standard as of january 1, 2019. this guidance will have a material impact on the company's consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of lease liabilities for its ground leases of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on the company's lease classification, a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations, or a notable impact on its liquidity. additionally, the standard will have no impact on the company's debt-covenant compliance under its current agreements.
in july 2018, the fasb issued additional guidance on the accounting for leases. the guidance provides companies with another transition method that allows entities to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption. under this method, previously presented years' financial positions and results are not adjusted. the company adopted this alternative transition method. the new guidance also provides lessors with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component if (1) the non-lease components would otherwise be accounted for under the new revenue recognition standard, (2) both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component, and (3) if accounted for separately, the lease component would be classified as an operating lease. the company adopted this practical expedient in its accounting for leases.
results of operations this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.

domestic site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs decreased $10.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. this change was primarily as a result of a $10.2 million decrease in the impairment charge recorded on decommissioned towers and a $0.3 million decrease in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers.
international site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs increased $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs increased $1.2 million. these changes were primarily as a result of a $1.6 million increase in the impairment charge recorded on decommissioned towers, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers.

interest income decreased $4.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, interest income decreased $4.2 million. these changes were primarily due to a lower amount of interest bearing deposits held in brazil and lower effective interest rates on those deposits as compared to the prior year.
interest expense increased $52.5 million, on an actual and constant currency basis, for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, due to a higher weighted average interest rate and higher average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding as compared to the prior year.
non-cash interest expense decreased $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower amounts of amortization of the discount related to the repayment of the 2014 term loan and 2015 term loan in april 2018, partially offset by higher amounts of amortization of the discount related to the issuance of the 2018 term loan in april 2018.
amortization of deferred financing fees decreased $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the repayment of the 2013-1c tower securities in march 2018, 2013-1d tower securities in march 2018, 2014 term loan in april 2018, and 2015 term loan in april 2018, partially offset by the issuance of the 2018-1c tower securities in march 2018 and the incurrence of the 2018 term loan in april 2018.
loss from extinguishment of debt was $14.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 due to the write-off of the unamortized financing fees associated with the repayment of the 2013-1c tower securities and 2013-1d tower securities in march 2018, as well as the write-off of the original issuance discount and unamortized financing fees associated with the repayment of the 2014 term loan and 2015 term loan in april 2018. loss from extinguishment of debt was $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the write-off of unamortized financing costs associated with the repayment of the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017.

revenues domestic site leasing revenues increased $34.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, due largely to (1) revenues from 438 towers acquired and 97 towers built since january 1, 2016 and (2) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments for additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators, partially offset by lease non-renewals primarily by metropcs, clearwire, and cricket.
international site leasing revenues increased $50.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing revenues increased $33.2 million. these changes were primarily due to (1) revenues from 1,518 towers acquired and 739 towers built since january 1, 2016, (2) organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual escalators, and (3) an increase in reimbursable pass-through expenses. site leasing revenue in brazil represented 13.4% of total site leasing revenue for the period.  no other individual international market represented more than 3% of our total site leasing revenue.
site development revenues increased $9.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, as a result of increased carrier activity.
operating profit domestic site leasing segment operating profit increased $34.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional profit generated by (1) towers acquired and built since january 1, 2016 and organic site leasing growth as noted above, (2) continued control of our site leasing cost of revenue, and (3) the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program.
international site leasing segment operating profit increased $33.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, international site leasing segment operating profit increased $21.8 million. these changes were primarily due to towers acquired and built since january 1, 2016 and organic site leasing growth as noted above, partially offset by increases in ground rent and repairs and maintenance costs.
site development segment operating profit increased $1.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in revenue from increased carrier activity partially offset by lower margins due to the type of work performed.

selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $12.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $13.7 million. these changes were primarily as a result of decreases in the provision for doubtful accounts, which included the $16.5 million oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016, and reit conversion expenses, partially offset by increases in non-cash compensation, personnel, salaries, benefits, and other support costs.

interest income increased $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, interest income decreased $0.3 million. these changes were primarily due to a lower average interest rate offset by a higher amount of interest bearing deposits held in brazil as compared to the prior year.
interest expense decreased $5.4 million, on an actual and constant currency basis, for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, due to the lower weighted average interest rate on debt, partially offset by a higher average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding as compared to the prior year. the decrease primarily resulted from the repayment of the 2010-2c tower securities in july 2016, the 5.75% senior notes in august 2016, the 5.625% senior notes in october 2016, and the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017, partially offset by the issuance of the 2016-1c tower securities in july 2016, 2016 senior notes in august 2016, 2017-1c tower securities in april 2017, 2017 senior notes in october 2017, and a higher average balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility in 2017.
non-cash interest expense increased $0.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the amortization of the discount related to the 2016 senior notes issued in august 2016.
amortization of deferred financing fees increased $0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the issuance of the 2017-1c tower securities in april 2017, the 2016-1c tower securities in july 2016, the 2016 senior notes in august 2016, and the 2017 senior notes in october 2017, partially offset by the repayment of the 2010-2c tower securities in july 2016, the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017, the 5.75% senior notes in august 2016, and the 5.625% senior notes in october 2016.
loss from extinguishment of debt was $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the write-off of unamortized financing costs associated with the repayment of the 2012-1c tower securities in april 2017.  loss from the extinguishment of debt was $52.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 due to the payment of a $25.8 million call premium and the write-off of $7.7 million in deferred financing fees on the redemption of the 5.75% senior notes, the payment of a $14.1 million call premium and the write-off of $4.1 million in deferred financing fees on the redemption of the 5.625% senior notes, and the write-off of $1.0 million in deferred financing fees related to redemption of the 2010-2c tower securities.

in interest expense and loss from extinguishment of debt, net, partially offset by fluctuations in our foreign currency exchange rates including changes recorded on the remeasurement of the intercompany loans.
non-gaap financial measures this report contains information regarding a non-gaap measure, adjusted ebitda. we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda, a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016. we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period's financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. in addition, we believe that excluding the oi reserve, which represents a $16.5 million one-time provision for doubtful accounts recorded in 2016, provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a non-recurring event.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and provision for or benefit from taxes.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2014 senior notes, 2016 senior notes, and 2017 senior notes. adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance.

subsequent to december 31, 2018, we acquired 27 towers and related assets for $10.7 million in cash.

the borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (1) within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2016-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2017-1c, and secured tower revenue securities series 2018-1c) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (2) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the borrowers or (3) during an amortization period. in all other circumstances, the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. the prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the tower securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid, calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement, on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date within twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2014-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2015-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2016-1c, secured tower revenue securities series 2017-1c, and secured tower revenue securities series 2018-1c) or eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the secured tower revenue securities series 2013-2c and secured tower revenue securities series 2014-2c) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component over (2) that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment.
43
to the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (1) 5% and (2) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the ten-year u.s. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.
pursuant to the terms of the tower securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. the monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as short-term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets (see note 4). however, if the debt service coverage ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as "excess cash flow," will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers. the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an "amortization period" will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. in addition, if any of the tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the tower securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the tower securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to network management, fourth to repay principal of the tower securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. furthermore, the advance rents reserve requirement states that the borrowers are required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant debt service coverage ratio is equal to or less than 2:1 and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1. the mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. among other things, the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets.

the following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the twelve months ended december 31, 2019 based on the amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2018 and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands):

2014 senior notes           $36,563

total debt service for the next 12 months        $1,338,415
(1)   the anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2014-1c tower securities is october 8, 2019 and october 11, 2044, respectively. interest expense included above is through the anticipated repayment date.

(2)   on february 1, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, sba senior finance ii, llc, entered into a four-year interest rate swap on a portion of our 2018 term loan. we swapped $1.2 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month libor plus 200 basis points for a fixed rate of 4.495% per annum. including the impact of the interest rate swap, the estimate of our debt service requirement based on the amounts outstanding for the 2018 term loan as of december 31, 2018 would have been $131,352.

inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date. however, we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are

governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in south america which have inflationary index based rental escalators.

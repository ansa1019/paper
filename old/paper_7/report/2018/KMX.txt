overview see part i, item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company's business.
carmax is the nation's largest retailer of used vehicles.  we operate in two reportable segments:  carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance ("caf").  our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by caf.  our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax.
carmax sales operations our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services, such as wholesale vehicle sales; the sale of extended protection plan ("epp") products, which include extended service plans ("esps") and guaranteed asset protection ("gap"); and vehicle repair service. we offer competitive, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles; value-added epp products; and superior customer service. our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail; sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle; and sales channels for customers who prefer to shop online.
our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us, and availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the sales process.  we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industry-leading third-party finance providers.  all of the finance offers, whether by caf or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option.
as of february 28, 2019, we operated 203 used car stores in 100 u.s. television markets. as of that date, we also conducted wholesale auctions at 76 used car stores and we operated 2 new car franchises.
carmax auto finance in addition to third-party finance providers, we provide vehicle financing through caf, which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax.  caf allows us to manage our reliance on third-party finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option.  as a result, we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales.  caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses. caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. after the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, caf financed 43.2% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2019.  as of february 28, 2019, caf serviced approximately 966,000 customer accounts in its $12.51 billion portfolio of managed receivables.
management regularly analyzes caf's operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables, including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and caf direct expenses.

changes in net earnings were impacted by the following:
•   in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("2017 tax act"), net earnings were reduced by $11.9 million in fiscal 2018. this net amount included a $32.7 million reduction for the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset, partially offset by a $20.8 million benefit that resulted from applying the new, lower blended federal statutory rate.
refer to "results of operations" for further details on our revenues and profitability.
liquidity our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.  during fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operations totaled $163.0 million. this amount, combined with $890.8 million of net issuances of non-recourse notes payable,
24
resulted in $1.05 billion of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, a non-gaap measure. this liquidity, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, was primarily used to fund the 13.6 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program, our store growth and strategic initiatives.
when considering cash provided by operating activities, management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, see "reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities" included in "financial condition - liquidity and capital resources."
future outlook our long-term strategy is to complete the rollout of our retail concept, including our new omni-channel experience, and to increase our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate. our new omni-channel experience empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms, either completely from home, in-store or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and in-store experiences. we believe that, over the long term, used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth. we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased caf income.
in calendar 2018, we estimate we sold approximately 4.4% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate and approximately 3.3% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis. our strategy to increase our market share includes continuing to focus on:
•   delivering a new customer-driven, omni-channel buying and selling experience that is a unique and powerful integration of our in-store and online capabilities.
•   opening stores in new markets and expanding our presence in existing markets.
•   hiring and developing an engaged and skilled workforce.
•   improving efficiency in our stores and our logistics operations to drive out waste.
•   leveraging data and advanced analytics to continuously improve our processes and systems.
in order to execute our long-term strategy, we are investing in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation, specifically with regards to customer facing and customer-enabling technologies. we continue to make improvements to our website and introduce new customer experiences, such as finance pre-approval, home delivery, online appraisal and express pick-up. we are also developing and implementing tools that help our associates be more efficient and effective. additionally, we are centralizing customer support in our customer experience centers, which we expect to provide a more seamless integration between the online and in-store experience for our customers. our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data to enhance the customer experience and increase operational efficiencies. in december 2018, we launched our new omni-channel car buying experience in the atlanta market, which will help us learn how to best operationalize all our offerings and scale them across the entire organization. we anticipate having the new omni-channel experience available to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal 2020.
while there are incremental costs and inefficiencies in the near term related to strategic initiatives, we have also identified potential cost savings through process changes and other improvements that can help offset these expenses over time. while in any individual period conditions may vary, over the long term, we would expect to begin leveraging our sg&a expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the mid-single digit range. with increased spending expected for fiscal 2020, we believe our comparable store used unit sales growth will need to be in the range of 5% to 8% to leverage sg&a. we expect the rate of growth in spending on these initiatives to slow in fiscal 2021 and taper thereafter. we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce waste and re-prioritize spend.
as of february 28, 2019, we had used car stores located in 100 television markets, which covered approximately 76% of the u.s. population. the format and operating models utilized in stores are continuously evaluated and may evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations. we opened 15 stores in fiscal 2019 and plan to open 13 stores in fiscal 2020 and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2021. for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2020, see the table included in "planned future activities."
while we execute our long-term strategy, there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term. a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local, regional and online wholesale auto auctions. wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand.

critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions.  we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions.  note 1 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies.  the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment.  our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed.
financing and securitization transactions we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities ("warehouse facilities") that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf. we typically elect to fund these receivables through an asset-backed term funding transaction, such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement, at a later date.  we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and asset-backed term funding transactions, including term securitizations (together, "non-recourse funding vehicles"), as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets.  caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses.
see notes 1(f), 1(h) and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables.
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date. such losses are expected to become evident during the following 12 months.  because net loss performance can vary substantially over time, estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain.
the allowance for loan losses is estimated using a combination of analytical models and management judgment. these models are primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables (including month of origination and actual prior performance of the receivables), historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves.  for receivables that have less than 12 months of performance history, the estimate also takes into account the credit grades of the receivables and historical losses by credit grade to supplement actual loss data in estimating future performance. once the receivables have 12 months of performance history, the estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance. the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable's life.
estimates from these models rely on historical performance information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio. therefore, management also considers recent trends in delinquencies and defaults, recovery rates and the economic environment in assessing the models used in estimating the allowance for loan losses, and may adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect factors that may not be captured in the models.  in addition, management periodically considers whether the use of additional metrics would result in improved model performance and revises the models when appropriate.
determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and, therefore, net earnings. to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings. a 10% change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately $13.8 million as of february 28, 2019.
see notes 1(h) and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses.

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. as part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 7‐day, money-back guarantee.  we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages.
we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a retail vehicle. the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while gap covers the customer for the term of their retail installment contract.  we recognize revenue, on a net basis, at the time of sale. we also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base.  our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive.  cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product.  results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. a 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $10.3 million as of february 28, 2019.  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves.
we are contractually entitled to receive profit-sharing revenues based on the performance of the esps administered by third parties. these revenues are a form of variable consideration included in the esp transaction price to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal. an estimate of the amount to which we expect to be entitled, subject to various constraints, is recognized upon satisfying the performance obligation of selling the esp. these constraints include factors that are outside of the company's influence or control and the length of time until settlement. we apply the expected value method, utilizing historical claims and cancellation data from carmax customers, as well as other qualitative assumptions. this estimate is reassessed each reporting period with changes reflected in other sales and revenues on our consolidated statements of earnings and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. profit-sharing payments by the esp provider begin when the underlying esps reach a specified level of claims history.
customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other third-party finance providers.  these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract.  we recognize these fees at the time of sale.
we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale.  these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales.
see note 2 for additional information on revenue recognition.

during fiscal 2019, we opened 15 stores, including 9 stores in new television markets (1 store each in greenville, nc; macon, ga; wilmington, nc; lafayette, la; corpus christi, tx; shreveport, la; buffalo, ny; montgomery, al; and new orleans, la) and 6 stores in existing television markets (1 store each in dallas, tx; miami, fl; albuquerque, nm; oklahoma city, ok; orlando, fl; and portland, or).
used vehicle sales fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. the 5.4% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a 3.8% increase in unit sales. the increase in used unit sales included a 0.3% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic. website traffic grew 16%. we believe that the solid performance of our store teams and the impacts of our digital initiatives contributed to our continued improvements in conversion in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. we believe our comparable store used unit sales growth was adversely affected by delays in february tax refunds relative to last year, the continuation of higher acquisition prices and a robust competitive environment. our data indicates that our share of the age 0- to 10-year old used vehicles in our current comparable store markets fell from approximately 4.5% to 4.4% in calendar 2018.
the increase in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of higher vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class. we believe vehicle acquisition costs remained high throughout fiscal 2019 as the industry continued to experience a lower than normal depreciation environment.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. the 8.5% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a 7.5% increase in unit sales. the increase in used unit sales included a 2.0% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by continued strong conversion, partially offset by lower store traffic.
average retail selling price for fiscal 2018 remained relatively consistent with the prior year, reflecting the net effects of shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class and lower vehicle acquisition costs. decreases in vehicle acquisition costs in the first half of the year were largely offset by increases in the second half of the year. we believe lower seasonal depreciation was a significant driver of the increase in vehicle acquisition costs in the second half of the year. at the same time, industry new vehicle transaction prices benefited from aggressive new car incentives. we believe the resulting change in the relative affordability of new vehicles versus late-model vehicles was one of the factors contributing to our comparable store used unit sales performance.

wholesale vehicle sales vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are, on average, approximately 10 years old with more than 100,000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. the 9.7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2019 resulted from a 9.5% increase in wholesale unit sales. the wholesale unit growth was primarily driven by growth in our store base, an increase in our appraisal buy rate and an increase in comparable store appraisal traffic. we believe the appraisal buy rate and comparable store appraisal traffic benefited from strong wholesale industry vehicle valuations, which allowed us to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2019 remained consistent with the prior year.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. the 4.7% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018 resulted from a 4.3% increase in wholesale unit sales. during fiscal 2018, increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to an increase in our appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base were partially offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic. wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2018 remained consistent with the prior year.
other sales and revenues other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap (collectively reported in epp revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), net third-party finance fees, and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales. the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers. the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf, tier 2 and tier 3 providers, or customers that arrange their own financing, may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants, changes in providers' credit decisioning and external market conditions. changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. other sales and revenues increased 11.1% in fiscal 2019. epp revenues increased 13.7% compared with the prior year, reflecting cost decreases from plan providers, the increase in our retail unit volume and $8.4 million in esp profit sharing revenues associated with our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard in fiscal 2019. see note 2 for additional information on revenue related to esps. the $6.5 million reduction in net third-party finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel, including an increase in our tier 2 and a decrease in our tier 3 sales.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. other sales and revenues increased 4.7% in fiscal 2018. epp revenues increased 10.1% compared with the prior year, largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales. the $11.5 million reduction in net third-party finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel, including a decline in our tier 2 and an increase in our tier 3 sales.

used vehicle gross profit we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold.  the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle's selling price.  our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit.
we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement.  other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments, vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs, and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process. vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. the 3.9% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the 3.8% growth in total used unit sales. our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2018. we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range, subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. the 8.0% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the 7.5% growth in total used unit sales. our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2017.
wholesale vehicle gross profit our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions.  the frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles.  our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. the 9.8% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2019 was driven by the 9.5% increase in wholesale unit sales. our wholesale gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2018. we believe our wholesale gross profit per unit continued to benefit from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. the 8.2% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018 was driven by the 4.3% increase in wholesale unit sales and a $35, or 3.8%, increase in wholesale gross profit per unit. we believe our wholesale gross profit per unit benefited from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends.
other gross profit other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues, net third-party finance fees and other revenues, which are predominantly comprised of service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning, and new vehicle sales.  we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent revenues paid to us by certain third-party providers. third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party tier 3 finance providers.  accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. other gross profit rose 14.1% in fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above.
31
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. other gross profit remained consistent in fiscal 2018, as a $19.2 million decrease in service profits and the decrease in net third-party finance fees discussed above were largely offset by the noted increase in epp revenues. service profits were affected by the reduced leverage of service department costs resulting from our more modest comparable store used unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018.
impact of inflation historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results.  profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices.  however, we believe higher vehicle acquisition prices, partially driven by lower seasonal vehicle depreciation, affected comparable store used unit sales growth, and therefore our results of operations, in fiscal 2018 and 2019. additionally, changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income, to the extent the average amount financed also changes.

fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 (increase of $113.2 million or 7.0%). in addition to the 8% growth in our store base during fiscal 2019 (representing the addition of 15 stores) and higher variable costs associated with our comparable store unit growth, the net increase reflected the following:
•   $12.2 million of the increase in compensation and benefits was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense, which increased sg&amp;a per used unit by $13.
•   $41.0 million increase in other overhead costs, which included continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support our core and omni-channel strategic initiatives.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017 (increase of $128.6 million or 8.6%). in addition to the 9% growth in our store base during fiscal 2018 (representing the addition of 15 stores) and higher variable costs associated with our comparable store unit growth, the net increase reflected the following:
•   $18.0 million increase in compensation and benefits due to the corporate incentive pay accrual.
32
•   $27.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense, which reduced sg&amp;a per used unit by $47. the decrease in share-based compensation expense reflected higher costs incurred in fiscal 2017 in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer, as well as a decrease in the expense related to cash-settled restricted stock units in fiscal 2018. the expense associated with these units was primarily driven by the change in the company's stock price during the fiscal year.
•   $19.3 million increase in other overhead costs, which included increased spending related to our core and omni-channel strategic initiatives.
interest expense interest expense includes the interest related to short- and long-term debt and financing and capital lease obligations. it does not include interest on the non-recourse notes payable, which is reflected within caf income.
fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. interest expense increased to $75.8 million in fiscal 2019 versus $70.7 million in fiscal 2018. the increase primarily reflected higher interest rates on outstanding debt in fiscal 2019.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. interest expense increased to $70.7 million in fiscal 2018 versus $56.4 million in fiscal 2017. the increase reflected the combined effects of higher outstanding debt levels and interest rates in fiscal 2018 as well as a reduction in capitalized interest.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 24.3% in fiscal 2019, 37.6% in fiscal 2018 and 37.7% in fiscal 2017. the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate following the enactment of the 2017 tax act.
the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate included the effect of an $11.9 million net increase in tax expense resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax act, including:
•   a $32.7 million increase in tax expense associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset.
•   a $20.8 million decrease in tax expense resulting from the new, lower blended federal statutory rate.
results of operations - carmax auto finance caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf's portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses. total interest margin reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs. changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time. continued increases in interest rates, which affect caf's funding costs, or other competitive pressures on consumer rates, could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations. changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months.
caf's managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years.  trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will, in the aggregate and excluding caf's tier 3 originations, result in cumulative net losses in the 2% to 2.5% range over the life of the loans.  actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors, including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations, economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates.  current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores.   because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period's financial results.
caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs.  although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions.  examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses.
see note 3 for additional information on caf income and note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality.

fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018.
•   caf income (increase of $17.5 million or 4.2%)
◦   the increase in caf income reflects an increase in the average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage and an increase in the provision for loan losses.
◦   average managed receivables grew 8.4% to $12.15 billion in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years.
◦   the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2019 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in average amount financed.
•   provision for loan losses (increased to $153.8 million from $137.6 million)
◦   the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to the growth in average managed receivables. as a result, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 1.10% as of february 28, 2019 compared with 1.11% as of february 28, 2018.
◦   although past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables has increased, annualized net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables has remained relatively flat.
•   total interest margin (decreased to 5.6% of averaged managed receivables from 5.7%)
◦   the decline in total interest margin percentage was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years.
fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017.
•   caf income (increase of $52.2 million or 14.1%)
◦   the increase in caf income reflects an increase in the average managed receivables and a decline in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage.
◦   average managed receivables grew 10.4% to $11.21 billion in fiscal 2018 driven primarily by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years.
◦   the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2018 resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in average amount financed, partially offset by a decrease in caf's penetration rate.
•   provision for loan losses (decreased to $137.6 million from $150.6 million)
◦   the provision during fiscal 2017 was affected by rising loss experience, while losses were generally consistent with expectations in fiscal 2018. as a result, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 1.11% as of february 28, 2018 compared with 1.16% as of february 28, 2017.
•   total interest margin (decreased to 5.7% of averaged managed receivables from 5.8%)
◦   the decline in total interest margin percentage was the result of gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to customers and our funding costs in recent years.
tier 3 loan originations. caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers, in order to better understand the performance of these loans, mitigate risk and add incremental profits.  caf currently targets originating approximately 5% of the total tier 3 loan volume; however, this rate may vary over time based on market conditions. a total of $162.4 million and $147.5 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio, as well as higher contract rates.  as of february 28, 2019 and 2018, approximately 10% of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement and caf. since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.
we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35% to 45%. in calculating this ratio, we utilize total debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders' equity. we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to maintain this targeted ratio; however, in any period, we may be outside this range due to seasonal, market, strategic or other factors.
operating activities. during fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $163.0 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $80.6 million in fiscal 2018 and $455.3 million in fiscal 2017, which included increases in auto loan receivables of $1.05 billion in fiscal 2019, $1.08 billion in fiscal 2018 and $1.21 billion in fiscal 2017.  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities.
as of february 28, 2019, total inventory was $2.52 billion, representing an increase of $128.8 million, or 5.4%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2019 as well as the ongoing optimization of inventory across stores.
36
as of february 28, 2018, total inventory was $2.39 billion, representing an increase of $130.1 million, or 5.8%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year.  the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2018 as well as an increase in acquisition costs resulting from higher wholesale valuations, especially in the months following hurricanes harvey and irma.
when considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable.  this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the year.  the resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-gaap financial measure.  we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations.  including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows:

compared with fiscal 2018, the increase in fiscal 2019 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the increase in net earnings when excluding non-cash expenses, which include depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves and the deferred income tax provision as well as an increase in cash provided by working capital.
compared with fiscal 2017, the increase in fiscal 2018 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory during fiscal 2018 and the increase in net earnings when excluding non-cash expenses. these increases were partially offset by the timing and use of non-recourse funding vehicles in relation to originations of auto loan receivables.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities totaled $308.5 million in fiscal 2019, $301.9 million in fiscal 2018 and $420.0 million in fiscal 2017.  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $304.6 million in fiscal 2019, $296.8 million in fiscal 2018 and $418.1 million in fiscal 2017. capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs, real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses.  we maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years.  we opened 15 stores in each of fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $186.0 million in fiscal 2019, $413.4 million in fiscal 2018 and $921.9 million in fiscal 2017.  included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $890.8 million, $902.2 million and $1.21 billion, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.05 billion, $1.08 billion and $1.21 billion, respectively, in auto loan receivables (see operating activities).  during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by $168.9 million and $42.6 million, respectively. during fiscal 2017, we sold $500 million of senior unsecured notes in a private placement, and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $904.7 million in fiscal 2019, $579.6 million in fiscal 2018 and $564.3 million in fiscal 2017.

borrowings under our $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us.  the credit facility, term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions and covenants.  if these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity.
see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility, term loan, senior notes and financing and capital lease obligations.
caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and asset-backed term funding transactions.  these non-recourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our non-recourse funding vehicles, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings.  similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables.  we do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these non-recourse funding vehicles.
as of february 28, 2019, $10.66 billion and $1.88 billion of non-recourse notes payable were outstanding related to asset-backed term funding transactions and our warehouse facilities, respectively.  during fiscal 2019, we funded a total of $5.76 billion in asset-backed term funding transactions.
we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time, as our store base, sales and caf loan originations have grown. see notes 1(f) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities.
the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers.  if these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities.  we generally repurchase the receivables funded through these warehouse facilities when we enter into an asset-backed term funding transaction. if our counterparties were to refuse to permit these repurchases it could impact our ability to execute on our funding program. in addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer.  further, we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents.
we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations, borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf, capital expenditures, repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future.  we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing, funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs.  however, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements.
38
the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors.  shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock.  as of february 28, 2019, a total of $2.75 billion of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding, with no expiration date.  at that date, $2.11 billion remained available for repurchase. see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity.

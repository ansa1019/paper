item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and with part i, item 1a, "risk factors." please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business overview we enable our customers to design electronic products. our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems, ics, electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products. our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers' products to market and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. we offer software, hardware, services and reusable ic design blocks, which are commonly referred to as ip.
our strategy, which we call sde, is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product. our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems, as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated. our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our products is driven by our customers' investment in new designs and products. historically, the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as eda. today, our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde.
we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities:
•   functional verification, including emulation and prototyping hardware;
•   digital ic design and signoff;
•   custom ic design and simulation;
•   system interconnect and analysis; and
•   ip.
for additional information about our products, see the discussion in item 1, "business," under the heading "products and product strategy."
we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
results of operations financial results for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016, reflect the following:
•   the effects of adopting asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," which provided a new basis of accounting for our revenue arrangements during fiscal 2018;
•   increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from overall growth in our software, hardware and ip business, particularly in the united states and asia; and
•   continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products.
the adoption of topic 606 limits the comparability of revenue and certain expenses, including sales commissions, presented in the results of operations for fiscal 2018, when compared to the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. for additional information regarding the adoption of this and other accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal 2018, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "recently adopted accounting standards."
our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31. fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years.
revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and ip, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip. the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.
approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer. revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our software arrangements, services, royalties from certain ip arrangements, maintenance on ip licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. revenue recognized at a point in time is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and ip licenses. our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers.
24
during fiscal 2018, we recognized revenue based on asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," whereas during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we recognized revenue based on "revenue recognition (topic 605)." therefore, the periods are not directly comparable. for additional information on the impact of the new accounting standard on our revenue, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "recently adopted accounting standards."
revenue by year the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the change in revenue between years:

product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products resulting in revenue growth in each of our five product categories. product and maintenance revenue may fluctuate from period to period and by geography based on demand for our hardware and ip offerings. product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because of growth in our software and ip businesses, partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware.
services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations.
no one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period. cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.
the changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following:
change
2018 vs. 2017       2017 vs. 2016
(in millions)
emulation and prototyping hardware costs         $17.7              $(22.9        )
other items                                        1.2              (3.1          )
$18.9              $(26.0        )
costs of emulation and prototyping increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware and related costs. costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to decreased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware. gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle, product competition, product mix and pricing strategies.
cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. cost of services increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom ip offerings.
operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results.
stock-based compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock between grant dates have resulted in higher grant date fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period. we expect stock-based compensation to increase operating expenses during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. for further discussion regarding stock-based compensation, see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
27
many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."

we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products and we must keep pace with our customers' technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers' increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring and incremental costs resulting from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.

general and administrative costs decreased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to decreases in expense related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are included in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, partially offset by increases in reserves on receivables from our customers. general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits.

restructuring and other charges we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.

income taxes the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016:
2018                                                            2017                    2016

our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal income tax effects of the tax act and state and foreign income taxes on fiscal 2018 income, partially offset by $21.3 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year.
30
during fiscal 2018, we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from $67.2 million to $65.8 million. we finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change. for further discussion regarding our accounting for the tax act, see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the tax act. the provisional amount related to the transition tax was $67.2 million and the provisional amount related to the re-measurement of our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities for the u.s. tax rate reduction was $25.2 million. our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 included $32.0 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 is primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the united states research tax credit in december 2015. during fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stock-based compensation that required all income tax effects of stock-based awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled. our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 includes $17.2 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.
our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. we currently expect that our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 10%. we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. we may also revise our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the tax act, including future guidance issued by the u.s. department of treasury and the irs. for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for further discussion regarding our income taxes, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

cash and cash equivalents as of december 29, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $533.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $688.1 million as of december 30, 2017.
our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, principal payments on the 2019 term loan, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of non-marketable investments, payments on our revolving credit facility, tax payments and purchases of property, plant and equipment.
approximately 75% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 29, 2018. we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
net working capital net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. the decrease in our net working capital as of december 29, 2018, as compared to december 30, 2017, is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
cash flows from investing activities cash flows provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily because we did not acquire any businesses in fiscal 2018, offset by payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio. we expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on our $300.0 million 2019 term loan, an increase in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in net proceeds on our revolving credit facility. the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings.
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources stock repurchase program in january 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $525.0 million in the aggregate. as of december 29, 2018, approximately $175.0 million remained available under this authorization. in february 2019, our board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. the actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. see part ii, item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" for additional information.

revolving credit facility our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. the credit facility expires on january 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28, 2022. outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. as of december 29, 2018, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.
2024 notes in october 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due october 15, 2024. we received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. interest is payable in cash semi-annually. the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. as of december 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes.

(1)   with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december 29, 2018 or the earliest cancellation date.
(2)   included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $18.7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. of the $18.7 million, we estimate $17.5 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years and $1.2 million within 3 to 5 years. the remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 29, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. at least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. for information on our significant accounting policies, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the tax act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes. our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.
we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. to make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or ip licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. in some arrangements, such as most of our ip license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. in other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.
judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices ("ssps") for each distinct performance obligation. we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation. in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp.
revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. for our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. for our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.
if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.
we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. in some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.

business combinations when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. these estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.
we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.
new accounting standards leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)," requiring, among other things, the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet by lessees for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. a modified retrospective approach is required, applying the new standard to leases existing as of the date of initial application. an entity may choose to apply the standard as of either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we adopted the new standard on december 30, 2018, the first day of fiscal 2019, and used the effective date as our date of initial application. consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward our prior conclusions about lease identification and classification.
we estimate the key change upon adoption of the standard will result in balance sheet recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities ranging from $75 to $85 million as of december 30, 2018, which is based on the present value of committed lease payments. we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within our consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows.
the new standard also provides updated guidance for lessor accounting; however, we do not expect the new standard to have a material effect on our financial statements for arrangements in which we are the lessor.
credit losses in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "measurement of credit losses on financial instruments," which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. the new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets, including trade and other receivables, at each reporting date. the new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. the new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.
goodwill impairment in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "simplifying the test for goodwill impairment," that eliminates "step 2" from the goodwill impairment test. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.

income tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, "reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income," which allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. the new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the tax act is recognized. the new standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.
stock-based compensation in june 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-07, "improvements to nonemployee share-based payment accounting," to simplify the accounting for share-based transactions with nonemployees in which the grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed. under the new standard, most of the guidance on recording share-based compensation granted to nonemployees will be aligned with the requirements for share-based compensation granted to employees. this standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-13, "disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement," which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. while we continue to assess the potential impact of this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
internal-use software in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-15, "customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract," which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

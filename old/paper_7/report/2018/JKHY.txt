satisfaction and retention. we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and randomly generated daily surveys we receive in our everyday business. dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.
during the last five fiscal years, our revenues have grown from $1,173,173 in fiscal 2014 to $1,536,603 in fiscal 2018. net income has grown from $186,715 in fiscal 2014 to $376,660 in fiscal 2018. the revenue growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion. net income in fiscal 2018 included a net tax benefit of $118,367 recorded as result of the tcja.
our two primary revenue streams are "services and support" and "processing". services and support includes: "outsourcing and cloud" fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or longer at inception; "product delivery and services" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, consulting, and hardware; and "in-house support" revenue, which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms. processing revenue includes: "remittance" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and automated clearing house (ach) transactions; "card" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and "transaction and digital" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile processing fees. we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.

results of operations fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
in fiscal 2018, revenues increased 7% or $105,486 compared to fiscal 2017. deconversion fees increased $6,021 compared to the prior fiscal year, and we had revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions totaling $17,145. excluding these factors, and excluding $9,341 of revenue from the fiscal 2017 year-to-date period related to divestitures, total revenue still increased 7%, with strong growth in each of our revenue streams as discussed in detail below.
operating expenses increased 8% year over year. excluding costs related to deconversion fees from each year, expenses related to fiscal 2018 acquisitions, fiscal 2017 costs related to divestitures, and gains on the disposals of businesses from each year, operating expenses increased 7%.
the tcja had a large impact on our provision for income taxes and net income, which are discussed below.
we move into fiscal 2019 following a strong performance in fiscal 2018. significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging. our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times, they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities.

reportable segment discussion the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations.
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, jha changed its reportable segment structure from two customer-centric segments, bank and credit union, to four product-centric segments. the change was made based on the view of our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker, that the company could be more effectively managed using a product-centric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration.
the company's operations are classified into four reportable segments: core, payments, complementary, and corporate and other. the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including atm, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, and risk management products and services. the complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our core solutions or used independently. the corporate & other segment includes hardware revenue and costs, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments.
the prior periods presented have been retroactively recast to conform to the new segment structure adopted july 1, 2017.

in fiscal 2018, revenue in the core segment increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, driven primarily by increases in both product delivery and services revenue and outsourcing and cloud revenue. the increase in product delivery and services revenue was mainly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. cost of revenue for the core segment increased 10% for the year-to-date period.
in fiscal 2017, revenue in the core segment increased 12%, due to increased support and service revenue driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream. the increased product delivery and services revenue was partly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of

revenue in the complementary segment increased 7% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. the increase was driven by increased outsourcing and cloud services, as well as increased transaction and digital processing. excluding deconversion fees from each period and vanguard software group revenue from fiscal 2018, revenue increased 6%. cost of revenue increased 6%, but was a consistent percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
in fiscal 2017, revenue in the complementary segment increased 10%. the increase was primarily in our support and service revenue, and was driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream. the increased product delivery and services revenue was due in part to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. cost of revenue increased 7% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

revenue in the corporate and other segment for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 decreased mainly due to a loss of revenue from our jhadirect product line, which was disposed near the beginning of fiscal 2018. for fiscal 2017, revenue from jhadirect totaled $6,536. revenue classified in the corporate and other segment includes revenue from hardware and other products not specifically attributed to any of the other three segments.
the decreased revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in the corporate and other segment is largely due to alogent revenue of $28,422 included in fiscal 2016.
cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments.
liquidity and capital resources the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $31,440 at june 30, 2018 from $114,765 at june 30, 2017. the decrease is primarily due to our acquisitions of vanguard software group and ensenta, the latter of which was partially funded by borrowing on our revolving credit facility, which has now been re-paid.

net cash provided by operating activities      $412,142              $357,322
cash provided by operating activities increased 15% compared to fiscal 2017. cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and for capital expenditures.
cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 totaled $291,826 and included: $137,562, net of cash acquired, for the purchases of ensenta corporation and vanguard software group; $96,647 for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $40,135, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; $13,138 for the purchase and development of internal use software; and $5,000 for the purchase of preferred stock of automated bookkeeping, inc. this was partially offset by $350 of proceeds from the sale of businesses, and $306 of proceeds from asset sales.
cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 totaled $141,586 and included: $89,631 for the development of software; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $41,947, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; and $16,608 for the purchase and development of internal use software. these expenditures were partially offset by $5,632 of proceeds from the sale of businesses and $968 of proceeds from the sale of assets.
financing activities used cash of $203,641 for fiscal 2018. cash used was $175,000 for repayment on our revolving credit facility, dividends paid to stockholders of $105,021, and $48,986 for the purchase of treasury shares. these uses were partially offset by borrowings of $125,000 on our revolving credit facility and $366 of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation.
financing activities used cash in fiscal 2017 of $171,281. cash used was $130,140 for the purchase of treasury shares, dividends paid to stockholders of $91,707, and repayments of the revolving credit facility and capital leases totaling $30,200. this was partially offset by borrowings of $80,000 and $766 of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation.
at june 30, 2018, the company had negative working capital of $19,360, however, the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $355,538, which primarily relates to our annual in-house maintenance agreements and deferred bundled product and service arrangements. the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance. in addition, we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we have access to remaining lines of credit in excess of $300,000. we continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations. therefore, we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition.
capital requirements and resources the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. capital expenditures totaling $40,135 and $41,947 for the twelve months ending june 30, 2018 and june 30, 2017, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. these additions were funded from cash generated by operations. at june 30, 2018, the company had $2,076 of material outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment.
the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock. under this authorization, the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. at june 30, 2018, there were 26,108 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3,883 additional shares. the total cost of treasury shares at june 30, 2018 is $1,055,260. during fiscal 2018, the company repurchased 448 treasury shares for $48,986. at june 30, 2017, there were 25,660 shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 4,330 additional shares.
revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to $600,000. the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on libor
27
or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) the prime rate for such day, (ii) the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus 0.50% and (iii) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars plus 1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the company's leverage ratio. the credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company. the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. as of june 30, 2018, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. the revolving loan terminates february 20, 2020 and at june 30, 2018 there was no outstanding balance.
other lines of credit the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on april 24, 2017 which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. the credit line was renewed through april 30, 2019. at june 30, 2018, no amount was outstanding.
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at june 30, 2018, the company's total off balance sheet contractual obligations were $656,507. this balance consists of $63,370 of long-term operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2019 to 2030 and $593,137 of purchase commitments. jha entered a strategic services agreement with first data® and pscu® to provide full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers, as well as expand its card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base. this agreement includes a purchase commitment of $559,354 over the term of the contract. the remainder of the purchase commitments relate mainly to open purchase orders. the contractual obligations table below excludes $11,507 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014. this standard is part of an effort to create a common revenue standard for u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") and international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"). the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. the new model enacts a five-step process for achieving the core principle, which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, the fasb also issued asu no. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year, but allows early application as of the original effective date. we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early, so the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-08, which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard. additional updates, including asu no. 2016-10, asu no. 2016-12, and asu no. 2016-20, also address specific aspects of the new standard and are being considered. entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods (full retrospective) or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption (modified retrospective). we plan to adopt the new standard using the full retrospective method.
the company has taken the following steps in evaluating and planning for the implementation of the new standard:
•   organization of a cross-functional implementation team whose goals are to: assess the impact of the guidance on each of our revenue streams by applying the five step model; determine new processes and procedures necessary to ensure proper revenue and cost recognition; quantify the effects of the new standard on prior and current year revenue; determine opening balances for deferred revenues and costs, including tax effects, as of the beginning of fiscal 2017; develop disclosures required upon the adoption of the new standard; and develop new internal controls to ensure compliance with the new standard.
28
•   continued implementation and testing of new revenue recognition software that will apply the five-step model to each of our customer contracts.
•   continued comparisons of revenue recognition under current accounting methods versus under asc topic 606 for each of our revenue streams.
determinations that have been made regarding the effect of the new standard are as follows:
•   we expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our revenue recognition currently subject to asc topic 985. one of the most significant expected impacts relates to the recognition of license and implementation revenue on our multi-element arrangements. under the current standard, license and implementation revenue on these arrangements is often recognized over the maintenance period of the software due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe") for these elements. under asc topic 606, revenue for license and implementation will no longer be deferred due solely to a lack of vsoe. generally, each license and its implementation will be recognized as one performance obligation at the time the implementation is completed.
•   this new model will require more use of judgments and estimates than the current standard, including identifying performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation based on stand-alone selling price, and allocating commissions to the proper performance obligations so that costs are correctly recognized in line with revenue. we will be required to estimate the total expected value of variable consideration arising from items such as maintenance and transaction or item processing at contract inception and include those estimates in the total transaction price of the contract to be allocated to each performance obligation. these estimates will be modified over the term of the contract, resulting in re-allocations of the transaction price and adjustments to revenue recognized on the contract.
significant implementation matters still being addressed include:
•   determination of opening balances for deferred revenues and costs, and the quantitative effect of the new standard on prior and current year revenues and costs. our analysis of the quantitative effects of the new standard on fiscal years 2017 and 2018 will continue at least through early september 2018.
•   development of required disclosures under the new standard.
•   updates to our internal controls surrounding the new system and processes.
•   assessment of the impacts of the new standard on deferred income taxes and provision for income taxes.
the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases, in february 2016. this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements. specifically, the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straight-line basis. asu no. 2016-02 will be effective for jha's annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. at transition, a modified retrospective approach must be utilized to measure leases as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, however, the fasb has provided certain practical expedients, which the company is currently evaluating. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and when we will adopt it.
the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, in march 2016. the new standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting and presentation of share-based payment transactions, including reporting of excess tax benefits and shortfalls, statutory minimum withholding considerations, and classification within the statement of cash flows. the standard allows a one-time accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate them. asu no. 2016-09 was effective for the company's annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2017. management elected to early adopt this standard as of july 1, 2016 and has elected to continue our current practice of estimating forfeitures. the adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
•   consolidated statements of income- the new standard requires that the tax effects of share-based compensation be recognized in the provision for income taxes. previously, these amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital. for fiscal 2018, net tax benefits related to share- based compensation awards of $3,274 were recognized as reductions of income tax expense, reducing our income tax rate by 0.84%, and increasing our basic and diluted earnings per share each by $0.04. for fiscal 2017, net tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards of $2,638 were recognized as reductions of income tax expense. these tax benefits reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.72%, and caused an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for fiscal 2017. in addition, in calculating potential common
29
shares used to determine diluted earnings per share, u.s. gaap require us to use the treasury stock method. the new standard requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in additional paid-in capital. these changes were applied on a prospective basis.
•   consolidated statements of cash flows- the company elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively. the recast for fiscal 2016 resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operations and net cash used in financing of $1,306. the presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
asu 2016-15 issued by the fasb in august 2016 clarifies cash flow classification of eight specific cash flow issues and is effective for our annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2018. we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early. we do not expect any significant impact to our financial statements as a result of this standard.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.
we have identified several critical accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with u.s. gaap and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the sec. the application of these pronouncements requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements, and whether "vsoe" of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time. changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements.
license arrangements: for software license agreements, the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until payments become due. the company's software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or "elements." generally, none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements.
for multiple element arrangements, which contain software elements and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. for our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price ("esp"). for our software elements, we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established.
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. esp is determined after considering both market conditions (such as the sale of similar products in the market place) and entity-specific factors (such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction).
for our non-software deliverables, a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control.
30
for our software licenses and related services, including the software elements of multiple-element software and non-software arrangements, u.s. gaap generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value. vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for stand-alone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation, if the hours can be reasonably estimated. vsoe of fair value is determined for post-contract support ("pcs") based upon the price charged when sold separately. for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements, we have determined that vsoe cannot be established; therefore, revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs. at that point, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period, assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products & services revenue within support & service revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
for arrangements that include specified upgrades, such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement. for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined, revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered.
support and service fee revenue (non-software): maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized pro-rata over the contract period, typically one year.
outsourced data processing and atm, debit card, and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered.
hardware revenue: hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer, when title and risk of loss are transferred. the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross, as we are the primary obligor in the contract with the customer. the company also re-markets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers. gross hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period.
revenue-based taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis (i.e., excluded from revenues).
deferred costs costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties, which are prepaid, are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract, generally one to five years, with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues.
direct and incremental fulfillment costs associated with arrangements subject to asc 985-605 (for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established) are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue. deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985-605 consist primarily of certain up-front costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 5-7 years. these costs include commissions, costs of third-party licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services, consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits.
depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists. we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term, but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company's future consolidated operating results. we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any long-lived assets, and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment.
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products. for software that is to be sold, significant estimates and assumptions include: establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized, determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete.
31
for internal use software, capitalization begins at the beginning of application development. costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred. significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.
estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. also, liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our financial results.
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. third-party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecast revenues or profits on contract-related intangibles. numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired.
as goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. cash flow projections are based on management-approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance, operations and program management. key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. the company's most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value. however, significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

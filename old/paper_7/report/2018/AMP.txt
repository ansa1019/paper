item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements," our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the "consolidated five-year summary of selected financial data" and the "risk factors" included in our annual report on form 10-k. references to "ameriprise financial," "ameriprise," the "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ameriprise financial, inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.
overview ameriprise is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120-year history of providing financial solutions. we are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $823 billion in assets under management and administration as of december 31, 2018. we offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients' financial objectives. for additional discussion of our businesses, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. these factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.
financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. in addition, the business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change. to succeed, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives. the success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k - "risk factors."
equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the "spread" income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") and deferred sales inducement costs ("dsic") assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.
earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. in addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize dac and dsic, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings. for additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
in the third quarter of the year, we updated our market-related inputs and implemented model changes related to our living benefit valuation. in addition, we conducted our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. these aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. we also reviewed our active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy for our long term care ("ltc") business in the third quarter. see our consolidated and segment results of operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and ltc loss recognition.
we consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. these entities are defined as consolidated investment entities ("cies"). while the consolidation of the cies impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. for further information on cies, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of the cies are reflected in the corporate & other segment. on a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the cies and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the cies, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. we include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our asset management segment.
while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related dsic and dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life ("iul") benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related dac amortization; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; integration and restructuring charges; and the impact of consolidating cies, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. management uses certain of these non-gaap measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. also, certain of these non-gaap measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. throughout our management's discussion and analysis, these non-gaap measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. these non-gaap measures should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap measures.
it is management's priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.
our financial targets are:
•   adjusted operating total net revenue growth of 6% to 8%,
•   adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and
•   adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") of 19% to 23%.
the following tables reconcile our gaap measures to adjusted operating measures:

critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies.
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.
financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments. we evaluate our available-for-sale securities and certain other investments for impairment on a quarterly basis. the methodology and factors considered to determine impairments is discussed further in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
deferred acquisition costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our dac accounting policy.
non-traditional long-duration products for our non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts, universal life ("ul") and variable universal life ("vul") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be estimated gross profits ("egps") after that date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets, mortality levels and contractholder and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future. projection periods used for our annuity products are typically 30 to 50 years and for our ul insurance products 50 years or longer.
egps vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts). changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. when assumptions are changed, the percentage of egps used to amortize dac might also change. a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense. the effect on the dac balance that would result from the realization of unrealized gains (losses) on securities is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet.
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and vul insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. the long-term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of 9% for equity funds and 6.9% for fixed income funds. we typically use a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. the suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management's assessment of anticipated equity market performance.
a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense for variable annuity and vul insurance contracts. the following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income:

decrease in future long-term equity fund growth returns by 100 basis points                   (18             )                 (33                     )           (51         )

(1) an increase in the above assumptions by 100 basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount.
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.
traditional long-duration products for our traditional long-duration products (including traditional life and disability income ("di") insurance products), our dac balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums after the date to amortize the remaining balance. these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions over periods extending well into the future. these assumptions include interest rates, persistency rates and mortality and morbidity rates and are not modified (unlocked) unless recoverability testing is inadequate. projection periods used for our traditional life insurance are up to 30 years. projection periods for our di products are up to 45 years. we may experience accelerated amortization of dac if policies terminate earlier than projected or a slower rate of amortization of dac if policies persist longer than projected.
for traditional life and di insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable. if management concludes that dac are not recoverable, dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions.
future policy benefits and claims we establish reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products and short-duration products. reserves for non-traditional long-duration products include the liabilities related to guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts, a portion of our ul and vul policies and the embedded derivatives related to variable annuity contracts, indexed annuities and iul insurance. reserves for traditional long-duration products are established to provide adequately for future benefits and expenses for term life, whole life, di and ltc insurance products. reserves for short-duration products are established to provide adequately for incurred losses primarily related to auto and home policies.
the establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. if actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.
non-traditional long-duration products, including embedded derivatives ul and vul a portion of our ul and vul policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. these profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. the secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. the liability for these future losses is determined using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and the expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.
variable annuities we have approximately $72 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. the diversified variable annuity block consists of $27 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $45 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("gmwb") provisions. the business is predominately issued through the ameriprise financial advisor network. the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb") provisions. we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross-up ("ggu") benefits. in addition, we offer contracts with gmwb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit ("gmab") provisions and, until may 2007, we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") provisions. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts.
in determining the liabilities for gmdb, ggu, gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac valuation for the same contracts. as with dac, management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.
regarding the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, the source of behavioral risk is driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. we have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. a significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. on a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. the ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in quickly detecting changes in policyholder behavior.
at least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our benefit reserve, embedded derivative and dac balances. the variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing management's assumptions used in reserve calculations. the extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances.
see the table in the previous discussion of "deferred acquisition costs" for the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity and vul insurance contracts resulting from a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions.
embedded derivatives the fair value of embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non-life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions, indexed annuities and iul fluctuate based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. in addition, embedded derivatives are impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. this estimate results in a spread over the libor swap curve as of the balance sheet date. as our estimate of this spread over libor widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase.
additionally, our corporate actuarial department calculates the fair value of the embedded derivatives on a monthly basis. during this process, control checks are performed to validate the completeness of the data. actuarial management approves various components of the valuation along with the final results. the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is reviewed monthly with senior management.
see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives.
traditional long-duration products liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported di and ltc claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. these unpaid amounts are calculated using anticipated claim continuance rates based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for our experience. the discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts.
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life and di policies are based on the net level premium and ltc policies are based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management's current best estimate assumptions. both include anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on our experience. anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors.
short-duration products the liabilities for short-duration products primarily include auto and home reserves comprised of amounts determined from loss reports on individual claims, as well as amounts based on historical loss experience for losses incurred but not yet reported. such liabilities are based on estimates. our methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liabilities are continually reviewed, and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period such adjustments are made.
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available.
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see note 2, note 15 and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. for discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see item 7a.

income tax accounting inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items. estimates and judgments are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established, and the amount of such allowance if required. factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination, (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years, and (iv) tax planning strategies. management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and reduce the likelihood of the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets.
see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and our valuation allowance.

sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies' products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and ul and vul insurance.
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, mortgage loans, policy and certificate loans, margin loans, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of consolidated investment entities ("cies"); the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of cies; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; and realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and charges for other-than-temporary impairments of investments related to credit losses.
premiums premiums include premiums on auto and home insurance, traditional life, di and ltc insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums.
other revenues other revenues primarily include variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and ul and vul insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for ul insurance products) and administrative charges.
for discussion of our accounting policies on revenue recognition, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
banking and deposit interest expense banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates. the changes in fair value of stock market certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense.
distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers, net of amounts capitalized and amortized as dac. the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. the majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with ul and vul insurance and annuity contracts. the changes in fair value of indexed annuity and iul embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are included within interest credited to fixed accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits, as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging gmdb provisions. benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic.
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as dac are amortized over time. for annuity and ul/vul contracts, dac are amortized based on projections of egps over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. for other insurance products, dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period.
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and cie debt, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, such as financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.
assets under management and administration assets under management ("aum") include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the columbia threadneedle investments funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. aum also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our asset management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and cies. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.
assets under administration ("aua") include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies' products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. these assets include those held in clients' brokerage accounts. we generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. we do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. these assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheets. aua also includes certain assets on our consolidated balance sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. these assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

net revenues net revenues increased $703 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $12.1 billion for the prior year.
management and financial advice fees increased $361 million, or 6%, to $6.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $6.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in aum. average aum increased $35.4 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section.
distribution fees increased $120 million, or 7%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year reflecting average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which we completed during the first quarter of 2017.
net investment income increased $87 million, or 6%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships in 2017 due to the enactment of the tax act, a $31 million increase in net investment income of cies, a $13 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and an increase in interest earned on brokerage margin loans and cash balances due to higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $36 million decrease in net realized investment gains.
other revenues increased $144 million, or 13%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking and an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges, partially offset by a $7 million expense related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract.
banking and deposit interest expense increased $41 million, or 85%, to $89 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $48 million for the prior year due to higher average crediting rates on certificates, as well as higher average certificate balances.
expenses total expenses increased $433 million, or 4%, to $10.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $9.9 billion for the prior year.
distribution expenses increased $240 million, or 7%, to $3.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $3.4 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $69 million, or 3%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was an expense of $113 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $139 million for the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. the unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation.
•   our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter resulted in loss recognition of $51 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $57 million in the prior year. the loss recognition in both periods was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium increases.
•   a $25 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.
•   the impact on dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $47 million for the prior year.
•   a $356 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. the favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $250 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to an unfavorable impact of $106 million for the prior year. as the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the libor swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. as the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense.
•   a $106 million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related dsic amortization. this increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.2 billion change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.1 billion change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $4 million change in the dsic offset. the main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:
•   equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
•   other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year.
amortization of dac increased $55 million, or 21%, to $322 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $267 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $36 million for the prior year.
•   the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was an expense of $23 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year.
•   the impact of unlocking was a benefit of $33 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 and primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on ul and vul insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. the impact of unlocking for the prior year was a benefit of $12 million and primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on ul and vul insurance products and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation.
•   the positive impact on dac from lower than expected lapses on variable annuities was $10 million.
interest and debt expense increased $38 million, or 18%, to $245 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $207 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest expense of cies.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 33.1% for the prior year. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of the decrease in the federal statutory tax rate and a $286 million expense in 2017 due to provisions in the tax act, partially offset by lower levels of the dividends received deduction and a decrease in the benefit for net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments, which was $25 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $70 million for the prior year.

equal weighted: counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds. asset size is not a factor.
asset weighted: sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds. funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index.
aggregated allocation (managed) funds include funds that invest in other funds of the threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income.
aggregated threadneedle data includes funds on the threadneedle platform sub-advised by columbia management as well as advisors not affiliated with ameriprise financial, inc.

in march 2017, the uk invoked article 50 of the treaty of lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the european union on march 30, 2019. the full impact of the british exit from the eu (commonly known as "brexit") remains uncertain about how negotiations relating to the uk's withdrawal and new trade agreements will be conducted, as well as the potential consequences and precise timeframe for brexit. this uncertainty may have a negative impact on our uk and european net flows and foreign currency translation if the british pound weakens.
total segment aum decreased $63.9 billion, or 13%, during the year ended december 31, 2018 driven by net outflows of $21.2 billion, retail fund distributions of $13.8 billion, market depreciation and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. total segment aum net outflows included $8.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets.
global retail net outflows of $5.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 included $17.2 billion of net new outflows, partially offset by $11.6 billion of reinvested dividends. in u.s. retail, net new outflows of $14.1 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter from market dislocation, industry pressures on active strategies and outflows from former parent-related assets, partially offset by $11.5 billion of reinvested dividends. in europe, middle east and africa ("emea") retail, net outflows of $3.0 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter consistent with the industry reflecting weakened market sentiment across all regions related to market volatility and concerns over brexit, the economy and interest rates.
global institutional net outflows of $15.6 billion included $5.2 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and $2.5 billion of clo redemptions. third party institutional outflows were elevated and reflect lower sales and higher redemptions of equity and fixed income mandates.
in november 2017, we completed our acquisition of lionstone partners, llc ("lionstone investments"), a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. this acquisition added $5.4 billion in assets under management.

our annuities segment pretax adjusted operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization), decreased $245 million, or 35%, to $465 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $710 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, lower investment yields, variable annuity net outflows and the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance, partially offset by average equity market appreciation.
the impact of unlocking was an expense of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $120 million for the prior year. the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance ("mean reversion-related impacts") was an expense of $31 million ($19 million for dac, $5 million for dsic and $7 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2018 reflecting unfavorable market returns compared to a benefit of $81 million ($34 million for dac, $8 million for dsic and $39 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year reflecting favorable market returns.

riversource variable annuity account balances declined 10% to $72.0 billion as of december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year due to equity market depreciation and net outflows of $3.3 billion.
riversource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $8.7 billion as of december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down.

net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $53 million, or 8%, to $644 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $697 million for the prior year primarily due to a decrease of approximately $32 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $23 million from lower earned interest rates.
other revenues increased $35 million, or 6%, to $585 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $550 million for the prior year due to an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges driven by higher average fee rates on variable annuity guarantee sales and sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
expenses total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization) and the dac and dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $222 million, or 12%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year.
interest credited to fixed accounts decreased $12 million, or 3%, to $461 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $473 million for the prior year due to lower average fixed deferred annuity account balances.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic amortization) and the dsic offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $210 million, or 45%, to $677 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $467 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was an $18 million expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a $119 million benefit for the prior year. see our consolidated results of operations section for discussion of the drivers of unlocking.
•   the impact on dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $47 million for the prior year.
•   a $25 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and fixed index annuity benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, increased $19 million, or 10%, to $200 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $181 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $19 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $34 million for the prior year.
•   the impact of unlocking was a benefit of $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $1 million for the prior year. see our consolidated results of operations section for discussion of the drivers of unlocking.
•   the positive impact on dac from lower than expected lapses on variable annuities was $10 million.

net investment income increased $59 million, or 98%, to $119 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $60 million for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships in 2017 due to the enactment of the tax act.
general and administrative expense decreased $70 million, or 26%, to $200 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $270 million for the prior year primarily due to a $21 million decline in dol planning and implementation expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a $9 million expense in the prior year related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement.
our corporate & other segment includes our closed block ltc insurance, which had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $61 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to a loss of $73 million for the prior year.
as of december 31, 2018, our nursing home indemnity ltc block had approximately $88 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance, which was 55% of gaap reserves. this block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 81 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 87. fifty-five percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.
as of december 31, 2018, our comprehensive reimbursement ltc block had approximately $116 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.0 billion, net of reinsurance. this block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity ltc policies. the average attained age is 76 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 84. thirty-eight percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.
we utilize three primary levers to manage our ltc business. first, we have taken an active approach of steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 140% on our nursing home indemnity ltc block and 66% on our comprehensive reimbursement ltc block as of december 31, 2018. second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. as of december 31, 2017, we had 29,000 policies that were closed with claim activity, as well as 8,000 open claims. we apply this experience to our in force policies, which were 108,000 as of december 31, 2018, at a very granular level by issue year, attained age and benefit features. our statutory reserves are approximately $403 million higher than our gaap reserves and include margins for key assumptions like morbidity and mortality, as well as $210 million in asset adequacy reserves as of december 31, 2018. lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio by maintaining a liquid, investment grade portfolio that is currently in a net unrealized gain position.
we undertake an extensive review of active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using current best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. our annual review process includes an analysis of our key reserve assumptions, including, at this time, those for morbidity, terminations (mortality and lapses), premium rate increases, and investment yields. because we have a rigorous annual review of all key reserve assumptions, we believe we are materially less exposed to large one-time reserve adjustments.
our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy resulted in loss recognition of $51 million in 2018 compared to $57 million in the prior year. the loss recognition in both years was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium increases.

overall pretax income increased $623 million, or 39%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking, market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a positive impact from higher short-term interest rates and a $39 million increase in ltc reserves in the prior year primarily due to out-of-period corrections, partially offset by asset management net outflows, loss recognition of $57 million on ltc insurance products in 2017, higher performance-based compensation and a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships from the enactment of the tax act.
the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $83 million ($36 million for dac, $8 million for dsic and $39 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflecting favorable market returns compared to a benefit of $18 million ($6 million for dac, $2 million for dsic and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year.
net realized investment gains (net of the related dsic and dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) were $44 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $6 million for the prior year. the market impact on iul benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was a benefit of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $36 million for the prior year.

(1) includes a $5 million and $16 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the favorable unlocking impact in 2017 primarily reflected a positive impact from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. our annual review of ltc active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter resulted in loss recognition of $57 million in 2017 primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium increases. the unfavorable unlocking impact in 2016 primarily reflected low interest rates and higher persistency on living benefit contracts that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits, an update to market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation and other model updates. our review of our ltc business in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a loss recognition of $31 million due to low interest rates, higher morbidity and higher reinsurance expenses, slightly offset by premium increases.
net revenues net revenues increased $332 million, or 3%, to $12.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $11.8 billion for the prior year.
management and financial advice fees increased $613 million, or 11%, to $6.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $5.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in aum, as well as a $25 million increase in performance fees and higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. average aum increased $48.2 billion, or 8%, compared to the prior year primarily due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. see our discussion on the changes in aum in our segment results of operations section.
distribution fees decreased $24 million, or 1%, to $1.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $223 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, partially offset by market appreciation and higher brokerage cash spread due to an increase in short-term interest rates.
net investment income decreased $67 million, or 4%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships due to the enactment of the tax act, a $49 million decrease in net investment income of cies primarily due to a clo unwind in late 2016 and a $19 million decrease in investment income on fixed maturities driven by low interest rates, partially offset by net realized investment gains of $46 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $6 million for the prior year.
premiums decreased $97 million, or 7%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting higher ceded premiums for our auto and home business due to new reinsurance arrangements we entered into at the beginning of 2017 to reduce risk.
other revenues decreased $84 million, or 7%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking and the unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on iul benefits, partially offset by higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates on variable annuity riders. the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on iul benefits was a benefit of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $24 million for the prior year. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 included a $47 million unfavorable impact from unlocking compared to a $64 million favorable impact in the prior year. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 was a negative impact from lower projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from favorable mortality experience. the primary driver of the unlocking impact to other revenues for the prior year was a positive impact from higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience.
expenses total expenses decreased $291 million, or 3%, to $9.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $10.2 billion for the prior year.
distribution expenses increased $197 million, or 6%, to $3.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, investments in recruiting experienced advisors and a $27 million benefit in the prior year related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition testing of ltc insurance products, partially offset by a $147 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts and lower compensation due to asset management net outflows.
interest credited to fixed accounts increased $33 million, or 5%, to $656 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $623 million for the prior year primarily due to the market impact on iul benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $30 million for the prior year.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $413 million, or 16%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the year ended december 31, 2017 included a $139 million benefit from unlocking compared to a $229 million expense in the prior year. the unlocking impact for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation. the unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected low interest rates and an unfavorable impact from persistency on living benefit reserves, partially offset by a benefit from updates to withdrawal utilization and fee assumptions, as well as market-related inputs related to our living benefit valuation.
•   a $39 million increase in ltc reserves in the prior year, which included a $29 million out-of-period correction related to our claim utilization factor, a $5 million out-of-period correction related to our waiver of premium claim reserve and a $5 million impact from assumption changes for our active life reserve valuation as a result of loss recognition.
•   the impact on dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $47 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflecting favorable equity market and bond fund returns compared to a benefit of $12 million for the prior year.
•   a $64 million decrease in auto and home expenses reflecting the impact of new reinsurance arrangements and a lower non-catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by higher gross catastrophe losses. catastrophe losses, net of the impact of reinsurance, were $122 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $104 million for the prior year. the expanded reinsurance program resulted in ceded losses of approximately $104 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
•   a $57 million expense from loss recognition on the closed block ltc insurance products for the year ended december 31, 2017.
•   a $31 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $21 million negative impact in 2017 from changes in assumptions in the prior year unlocking process that resulted in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves.
amortization of dac decreased $148 million, or 36%, to $267 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $415 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was a benefit of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to an expense of $23 million for the prior year. the impact of unlocking for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on life insurance contracts and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation. the impact of unlocking in the prior year primarily reflected low interest rates that more than offset benefits from persistency on annuity contracts without living benefits.
•   in 2016, we wrote-off dac of $58 million in connection with the loss recognition on ltc insurance products.
•   the impact on dac from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $36 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $6 million for the prior year.
•   the dac offset to the market impact on iul benefits (net of hedges, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) was nil for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to an expense of $18 million for the prior year.
interest and debt expense decreased $34 million, or 14%, to $207 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $241 million for the prior year due to lower interest expense on cie debt primarily due to a clo unwind in late 2016.
general and administrative expense increased $74 million, or 2%, to $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $3.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher performance-based compensation and a $13 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees, partially offset by a $23 million expense in the prior year from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 33.1% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 17.4% for the prior year. the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $286 million expense in 2017 due to provisions of the tax act, including remeasurement of net deferred tax assets, a deemed repatriation tax of our total post-1986 earnings and profits and remeasurement of tax contingencies, partially offset by a $70 million benefit for net excess tax benefits related to the adoption of an accounting standard for employee share-based payments. see consolidated results of operations - year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 for additional details on the impact of the tax act.

our annuities segment pretax operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related dsic and dac amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization) and the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related dac amortization), increased $381 million to $710 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $329 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, equity market appreciation and the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance, partially offset by lower investment yields and a $21 million negative impact in 2017 from changes in assumptions in the prior year unlocking process that resulted in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves.
riversource variable annuity account balances increased 7% to $80.3 billion at december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.9 billion. lapse rates were higher in the year, reflecting increased client asset transfers from variable annuities to affiliated fee-based investment advisory accounts.
riversource fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $9.3 billion at december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates.
the impact on dac, dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $81 million ($34 million for dac, $8 million for dsic and $39 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflecting favorable market returns compared to a benefit of $18 million ($6 million for dac, $2 million for dsic and $10 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year.
net revenues net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased $36 million, or 1%, to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.
management and financial advice fees increased $39 million, or 5%, to $790 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $751 million for the prior year due to higher fees on variable annuities driven by higher average separate account balances. average variable annuity separate account balances increased $3.3 billion, or 5%, from the prior year due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.
net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $63 million, or 8%, to $697 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $760 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a decrease of approximately $45 million from lower earned interest rates and approximately $18 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows.
other revenues increased $44 million, or 9%, to $550 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $506 million for the prior year due to higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates on variable annuity riders.

•   the impact on dsic and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was a benefit of $47 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $12 million for the prior year.
•   a $31 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.
•   a $21 million negative impact in 2017 from changes in assumptions in the prior year unlocking process that resulted in ongoing increases to living benefit reserves.
amortization of dac, which excludes the dac offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and fixed index annuity benefits and the dac offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $28 million, or 13%, to $181 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $209 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:
•   the impact of unlocking was a benefit of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to an expense of $18 million for the prior year. see our consolidated results of operations section for discussion of the drivers of unlocking.

our corporate & other segment pretax operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating cies. our corporate & other segment pretax operating loss increased $67 million, or 19%, to $426 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $359 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a decrease in net investment income, an increase in general and administrative expense and loss recognition of $57 million on ltc insurance products in 2017, partially offset by loss recognition of $31 million on ltc insurance products in the prior year and a $29 million increase in ltc reserves in the prior year from a correction related to our claim utilization factor.
net investment income decreased $63 million, or 51%, to $60 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $123 million for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships due to the enactment of the tax act and the impact of interest allocation between subsidiaries.
distribution expenses increased $31 million due to a $27 million benefit in the prior year related to the write-off of the deferred reinsurance liability in connection with loss recognition on ltc insurance products.
benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $19 million, or 6%, to $313 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $294 million for the prior year. this is primarily due to a $57 million expense in 2017 from loss recognition and the related cumulative impact of updating future policyholder benefit assumptions to reflect management's current best estimate on ltc insurance products. the ltc reserves in 2016 increased by $39 million primarily due to a $29 million out-of-period correction related to our claim utilization factor for 2015 and prior years, a $5 million out-of-period correction related to our waiver of premium claim reserve from 2015 and prior years, and a $5 million impact from assumption changes for our active life reserve valuation.
amortization of dac decreased $63 million compared to the prior year reflecting the write-off of dac in the third quarter of 2016 in connection with the loss recognition on ltc insurance products.
general and administrative expense increased $16 million, or 6%, to $270 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $254 million for the prior year primarily due to higher performance-based compensation and a $9 million expense related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement, partially offset by a $14 million expense in the prior year from the resolution of a legacy legal matter related to the hedge fund business.
fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. we include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.
fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and iul insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. as a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and iul insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for profit, risk and expenses, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december 31, 2018. as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $490 million, net of dac, dsic, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on december 31, 2018 credit spreads.
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding cies. we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in october 2022. under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. at december 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31, 2018.
we enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank ("fhlb") advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while paying back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. the balance of repurchase agreements as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $50 million, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. our subsidiary, riversource life insurance company ("riversource life"), is a member of the fhlb of des moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had borrowings of $151 million and $150 million, respectively, from the fhlb, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. we believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.
dividends from subsidiaries ameriprise financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, riversource life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, ameriprise certificate company ("acc"), ampf holding corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, ameriprise financial services, inc.

in 2009, riversource established an agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company ("glic") for its reinsured ltc. in 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. management believes that this agreement and offsetting non ltc legacy arrangements with genworth financial, inc. will enable riversource to recover on all net exposure in the event of an insolvency of glic.

(1) see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our long-term debt. amounts include obligations under capital leases.
(2) these scheduled payments are represented by reserves of approximately $30.1 billion at december 31, 2018 and are based on interest credited, mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender and premium payment assumptions. the estimated payments are presented gross before reinsurance. the scheduled payments are undiscounted and exceed the corresponding liability at december 31, 2018. actual payment obligations may differ if experience varies from these assumptions. as of december 31, 2018, the projected period for which cash payments will be made is 40 years. separate account liabilities have been excluded as associated contractual obligations would be met by separate account assets.
(3) the payments due by year are based on contractual term maturities. however, contractholders have the right to redeem the investment certificates earlier and at their discretion subject to surrender charges, if any. redemptions are most likely to occur in periods of substantial increases in interest rates.
(4) the fair value of these commitments included on the consolidated balance sheets was $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2018. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred premium options.
(5) call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific. for date specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement. for event specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount of its capital commitment when properties in a fund become fully stabilized. for event specific obligations, the estimated call date of these commitments is used in the table above.
(6) purchase obligations include the minimum contractual amounts by period under contracts that were in effect at december 31, 2018. many of the purchase agreements giving rise to these purchase obligations include termination clauses that may require payment of termination fees if the agreements are terminated by us without cause prior to their stated expiration; however, the table reflects the amounts to be paid assuming the contracts are not terminated.
(7) interest on long-term debt was estimated based on rates in effect as of december 31, 2018.
in addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we periodically fund the employees' defined benefit plans. in 2019, we expect to contribute $14 million to our pension plans and $1 million to our defined benefit postretirement plans. see note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (in millions)
general during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company's revenue grew by 9.9%, driven by acquisitions of 7.6%, organic growth of 2.7%, and the benefit of foreign currency translation of 30 basis points, partially offset by the impact from divestitures of (0.7%). the company defines organic growth as the increase in revenue excluding revenue from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition.
during 2018, the company divested its covance food solutions business and its forensic testing services business in the united kingdom (u.k.) and the united states (u.s.) operating income for the divested businesses was $7.6 for the year ended december 31, 2018.
effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the full retrospective method. all financial results and comparisons to financial results in 2017 and 2016 have been restated. this accounting change increased revenue, lowered earnings, and had no impact on cash flow. upon adoption, bad debt expense within the labcorp diagnostics (lcd) segment is being classified as a reduction in revenue rather than as a selling, general and administrative expense. within the covance drug development (cdd) segment the standard impacts the accounting for changes in the scope of work, investigator fees, measures of progress and sales commissions.
on july 16, 2018, the company reported that it had detected suspicious activity on its information technology network and was taking steps to respond to and contain the activity. the activity was subsequently determined to be a new variant of ransomware affecting certain lcd information technology systems. cdd systems were not directly affected by the ransomware. as part of its response, the company promptly took certain systems offline to contain and remove the ransomware from its systems. the incident temporarily affected test processing and customer access to test results, and also affected certain other information technology systems involved in conducting company-wide operations. operations were returned to normal within a few days of the incident. as part of its in-depth investigation into this incident, the company engaged outside security experts and worked with authorities, including law enforcement. the investigation determined that the ransomware did not and could not transfer patient or client data outside of company systems and that there was no theft or misuse of patient or client data. the company has incurred total expenditures related to addressing this attack of $12.6 in consulting fees and employee overtime during the recovery period following the attack in addition to estimated lost revenue of $9.8.
the company has insurance coverage for costs resulting from cyber-attacks and has filed a claim for recovery of its losses resulting from this incident. however, disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon and the company has not recorded any estimated proceeds resulting from this claim. furthermore, while the company has not been the subject of any legal proceedings involving this incident, it is possible that the company could be the subject of claims from persons alleging they suffered damages from the incident, or actions by governmental authorities.
the company continues to invest in its technology and training to help protect its information technology systems and operations from cyber-attacks.
the company remains on track to deliver $150.0 of net savings from cdd's three-year launchpad initiative by the end of 2020, and $30.0 of cost synergies from the integration of chiltern by the end of 2019. the company expects phase ii of lcd's launchpad initiative to deliver approximately $200.0 in net savings over the next three years, while incurring approximately $40.0 in one-time implementation costs. approximately one-third of the total savings are expected to be realized each year.
the protecting access to medicare act (pama) which became law on april 1, 2014, and went into effect on january 1, 2018, resulted in a net reduction of revenue of approximately $70.0 in 2018 from all payers affected by the clinical lab fee schedule. unless further implementation of pama is delayed or changed, an additional reduction of approximately $115.0 is expected for 2019, from all payers affected by the clinical lab fee schedule.

in 2018, the company's effective tax rate was 30.3% and was favorably impacted by the u.s. federal corporate tax rate decreasing from 35.0% to 21.0%, partially offset by the additional tax recorded for tcja under sab 118 and the new tcja global intangible low taxed income (gilti) tax. additionally, the 2018 rate was higher due to increased income taxes paid on divestitures where net tax basis was lower than net book basis and certain restructuring activities.
the 2017 tax rate of (14.4)% resulted from the company recording a fourth quarter provisional estimate for the tcja, which resulted in a reduction in income tax expense arising from a re-measurement of deferred taxes, and the release of deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the deemed repatriation tax. given the significant changes resulting from the tcja, the estimated financial impact was provisional and subject to further clarification, which resulted in changes to these estimates in 2018. the 2017 rate was also favorably impacted by foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the u.s. and by share-based compensation.
in 2016, the company's effective rate of 33.6% was favorably impacted by foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory tax rate and, for 2016 specifically, by a reduction in certain foreign rates. the 2016 rate also benefited from the early adoption of share-based payment accounting and the reversal of uncertain tax position reserves.
the company considers substantially all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested overseas.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. while the company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. the company's audit committee periodically reviews the company's significant accounting policies. the company's critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:
•   revenue recognition;
•   pension expense;
•   accruals for self-insurance reserves;
•   income taxes; and
•   goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.
revenue recognition within the lcd segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when lcd receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test. the information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. lcd recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported. sales are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, medicare and medicaid and third-party.
the following are descriptions of the lcd payer portfolios:
clients client payers represent the portion of lcd's revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations (acos), employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. generally, client sales are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at lcd's client list price, less any negotiated discount. a portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products. in these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.
this portfolio also included lcd's nutritional chemistry services through cfs, which was sold on august 1, 2018. lcd offered a broad range of services to the food and nutraceutical and animal feed industries. revenue was recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on the volume of activities in each period.
patients this portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). uninsured patients are billed based upon lcd's patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. lcd bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.
medicare and medicaid this portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional medicare and medicaid programs. net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to lcd's results of operations in any period presented.
third-party third-party includes revenue related to mcos. the majority of lcd's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. these payers are billed at lcd's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. the majority of
61
index lcd's mco sales are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with sales for non-contracted mcos recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.
third-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with mcos and independent physician associations (ipas). under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by lcd from a capitation pool. when the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. lcd recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.
lcd has a formal process to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. the majority of lcd's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. anticipated write-offs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue and at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining revenue. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to lcd's results of operations in any period presented.
the nature of cdd's obligations include agreements to manage a full clinical trial, provide services for a specific phase of a trial, or provide research products to the customer. generally, the amount of the transaction price estimated at the beginning of the contract is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. other payments may also factor into the calculation of transaction price, such as volume-based rebates that are retroactively applied to prior transactions in the period.
historically a majority of cdd's revenues have been earned under contracts that range in duration from a few months to a few years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer. occasionally, cdd also has entered into minimum volume arrangements with certain customers. under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum dollar value of a service commitment is not reached, the customer is required to pay cdd for the shortfall. annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not recognized until the end of the period when the amount has been determined and agreed to by the customer.
cdd recognizes revenue either as services are performed or as products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted. if performance is completed at a specific point in time, the company evaluates the nature of the agreement to determine when the good or service is transferred into the customer's control.
service contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope. in cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue is recognized as services are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. in an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. the total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be provided.
when using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual units of input incurred by the total units of input budgeted in the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. in each situation, the company believes that the methods used most accurately depict the progress of the company towards completing its obligations. billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. in some cases, cdd bills the customer for the total contract value in progress-based installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration. these milestones include, but are not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing, investigator site initiation, patient enrollment and/or database lock. the term "billing milestone" relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project. these billing milestones are generally not performance-based (i.e., there is no potential additional consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance). in other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time (e.g., monthly billings). in either case, the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the customer would be the same at the end of the project.
proportional performance contracts typically contain a single service (e.g., management of a clinical study) and therefore no allocation of the contract price is required. fee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume. since the volume of activities in a fee-for-service contract is unspecified, the contract price is entirely variable and is allocated to the time period in which it is earned. for contracts that include multiple distinct goods and services, cdd allocates the contract price to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. if a price list is not available, cdd will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an "expected cost plus margin" approach.
while cdd attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of services, this is not always possible. while a project is ongoing, cash payments are not necessarily representative of
62
index aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms.
in some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized. for example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value upon contract signing, but at the time of signing performance of services has not yet begun. payments received in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the balance sheet. as the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the contract liability balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period.
in other cases, services may be provided and revenue recognized before the customer is invoiced. in these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference, representing a contract asset, is recorded for the amount that is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. once the customer is invoiced, the contract asset is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. all contract assets are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date.
most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to cdd of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to cdd of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by cdd under the contract if it had not been terminated early. termination fees are included in net revenues when services are performed and realization is assured.
the following are descriptions of the full range of drug development services provided by cdd:
preclinical services include the sale of research models, fee-for-service activities such as bioanalytical testing services, and proportional performance activities such as toxicology studies. revenue for sale of research models is recognized at a point in time, typically upon shipment, when control transfers to the customer. revenue for bioanalytical testing services is recognized at a point in time upon communication of results to the customer. revenue for proportional performance activities, including toxicology studies, is recognized using an input-based measure of progress in which revenue is recognized as expenses are incurred for the research models, labor hours, and other costs attributable to the study.
through its central laboratory, cdd produces and supplies specimen collection kits that are utilized in clinical studies, and provides transportation, project management, data management, and laboratory testing services on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of its customers' clinical studies. revenue for central laboratory services is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on volume of activities in each period. cdd also provides long-term specimen storage services, for which revenue is recognized using an input-based measure of progress based on costs incurred.
cdd provides clinical development and commercialization services, including clinical pharmacology services, full management of phase ii through iv clinical studies, and market access solutions. revenue for clinical pharmacology services, which includes first-in-human trials, is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on bed nights. revenue for full service clinical studies is recognized using an input-based measure of progress based on costs incurred (including pass-through costs such as investigator grants and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses). clinical services utilizing the input-based measure of progress account for approximately 50% of cdd revenue. revenue for market access solutions is recognized using various methods. revenue for fee-for-service arrangements, such as reimbursement consulting hotlines and patient assistance programs, is recognized using an output method based on transaction volume which corresponds to the amount charged to the customer. for consulting services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.
cdd endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. cdd maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected. this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant. since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management's judgment, actual bad debt write-offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded. historically, bad debt write-offs have not been material.
pension expense the company has a defined-benefit retirement plan (company plan) and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (pep). in october 2009, the company received approval from its board of directors to freeze any additional service-based credits for any years of service after december 31, 2009, on the company plan and the pep. both plans have been closed to new participants. employees participating in the company plan and the pep no longer earn service-based credits, but continue to earn interest credits. in addition, effective january 1, 2010, all employees eligible for the defined-contribution retirement plan (401k plan) receive a minimum 3% non-elective contribution (nec) concurrent with each payroll period. the 401k plan also permits discretionary contributions by the company of up to 1% and up to 3% of pay for eligible employees, based on service.
the company plan covers substantially all employees employed by the company prior to december 31, 2009. the benefits to be paid under the company plan are based on years of credited service through december 31, 2009, interest credits and average
63
index compensation. the company's policy is to fund the company plan with at least the minimum amount required by applicable regulations. the pep covers a portion of the company's senior management group. prior to 2010, the pep provided for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any maximum limitation on annual benefit payments under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the company plan but for such limitation. effective january 1, 2010, employees participating in the pep no longer earn service-based credits. the pep is an unfunded plan.
in addition, as a result of the covance acquisition, the company has a frozen non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (serp). the serp, which is not funded, is intended to provide retirement benefits for certain employees who were executive officers of covance prior to the covance acquisition. benefit amounts are based upon years of service and compensation of the participating employees. as a result of the covance acquisition, the company also sponsors two defined-benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two u.k. subsidiaries (u.k. plans) and one defined-benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees at a german subsidiary (german plan), all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies and are closed to new entrants. benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years of service and compensation. the german plan is unfunded while the u.k. plans are funded. the company's funding policy for the u.k. plans has been to contribute annually amounts at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.
the company's net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. the company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined-benefit retirement plans were a 4.3% discount rate and a 6.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company plan, a 4.4% discount rate for the pep, a 1.7% discount rate and a 2.0% expected salary increase for the german plan and a 2.5% discount rate and a 3.6% expected salary increase for the u.k. plans as of december 31, 2018.
discount rate the company evaluates several approaches toward setting the discount rate assumption that is used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. at year-end, priority was given to use of the towers watson bond:link model, which simulates the purchase of investment-grade corporate bonds at current market yields with principal amounts and maturity dates closely matching the company's projected cash disbursements from its plans. this completed model represents the yields to maturity at which the company could theoretically settle its plan obligations at year end. the weighted-average yield on the modeled bond portfolio is then used to form the discount rate assumption used for each retirement plan. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2018 retirement plan expense of $2.4 for the company plan and pep. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2018 retirement plan expense of $0.9 for the u.k. plans.
return on plan assets in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2018 pension expense of $2.5 for the company plan. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2018 pension expense of $2.8 for the u.k. plans.
net pension cost for 2018 was $20.9 as compared with $14.6 in 2017 and $14.9 in 2016. the increase in pension expense was due to increases in the amount of net amortization and deferral as a result of lower discount rates as well as a $7.5 settlement charge. pension expense for the company plan and the pep is expected to increase to $13.3 in 2019 as a result of a lower assumed discount rate and changes in participant mortality tables. pension expense for the germany plan and the u.k. plans is expected to increase to $1.2 in 2019 as a result of a decrease in the expected return on plan assets.
further information on the company's defined-benefit retirement plans is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
accruals for self-insurance reserves accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers' compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. these estimated liabilities are not discounted.
the company is self-insured (up to certain limits) for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. the company maintains excess insurance which limits the
64
index company's maximum exposure on individual claims. the company estimates a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. the liability is based on assumptions and factors for known and incurred but not reported claims, including the frequency and payment trends of historical claims.
if actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted. historical trends have not differed significantly from these estimates.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, the company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. the company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded the estimated impact of the tcja, which resulted in a favorable remeasurement of deferred taxes, partially offset by the deemed repatriation tax. in 2018, the company completed the analysis of the 2017 provisional estimated of the tcja in accordance with sab 118. the company recorded $45.0 of additional income tax expense in 2018 related to the tcja provisions implemented in 2017.
goodwill and indefinite-lived assets the company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. in accordance with updates to the financial accounting standards board's (fasb) authoritative guidance regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, an entity is allowed to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. otherwise, impairment testing must be performed in accordance with the original accounting standards. the updated fasb guidance also allows an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. similarly, a company can proceed directly to a quantitative assessment in the case of impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets as well.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. for the market-based approach, the company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control. at the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:
•   annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.
•   a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
65
index
•   a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. a discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. in addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.
under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.
management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. the company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for all reporting units except the canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses for which a quantitative assessment was performed.
in the qualitative assessment, the company considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, ii) financial performance versus management's annual and five-year strategic plans, iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. if applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. based on the results of the qualitative assessment, the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.
in 2018, the company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of its canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses. based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, the company concluded that the fair value of the indefinite-lived canadian licenses was greater than the carrying value.
it is possible that the company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the company's goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda. the company will particularly monitor the financial performance of and assumptions for two of the cdd reporting units for which an income approach was performed in 2018. a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

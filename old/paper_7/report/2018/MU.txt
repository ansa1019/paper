total net sales total net sales for 2018 increased 50% as compared to 2017. higher sales in 2018 for both dram and nand products as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering high-value products featuring our 1xnm dram and 64-layer 3d nand technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets. sales of dram products for 2018 increased 64% from 2017 primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of approximately 35% and an increase in sales volumes of approximately 20% as a result of strong market conditions, particularly for cloud, enterprise, mobile, and graphics markets, combined with increased sales into high-value markets. sales of trade nand products for 2018 increased 26% from 2017 despite declines in average selling prices primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 40% driven by increases in sales of high-value ssd and mobile managed nand products enabled by strong demand and our execution in delivering 3d nand products.
total net sales for 2017 increased 64% as compared to 2016 due to strong conditions across our primary markets, particularly for enterprise, mobile, client, and ssd storage. sales of dram products for 2017 increased 80% from 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 50% and an increase in average selling prices of approximately 20% as a result of the strong market conditions. sales of trade nand products for 2017 increased approximately 50% as compared to 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 65% resulting from strong market demand for our 3d nand products, which was partially offset by declines in average selling prices. increases in dram and nand sales volumes for 2017 as compared 2016 were enabled by higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology and solid execution. increases in sales volumes for nand products for 2017 were also enabled by key customer qualifications of new products.
overall gross margin our overall gross margin percentage increased to 59% for 2018 from 42% for 2017 primarily due to favorable market conditions across key markets combined with strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies, including 1xnm dram and 64-layer 3d nand, enabling manufacturing cost reductions. for 2018 as compared to 2017, pricing for dram products increased while manufacturing costs declined and, for nand products, manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.
our overall gross margin percentage increased to 42% for 2017 from 20% for 2016 primarily due to strong markets that drove favorable pricing conditions and solid execution in manufacturing cost reductions from improvements in product and process technology. for 2017 as compared to 2016, pricing for dram products increased while manufacturing costs declined
29
and, for nand products, manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in selling prices. we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions, an increased re-use rate of equipment, and industry trends. as a result, we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation expense at the time by approximately $100 million per quarter.
from january 2013 through december 2015, we purchased all of inotera's dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components. after december 2015 through december 6, 2016, the date we acquired the remaining interest in inotera, the price for dram products we purchased from inotera was based on a formula that equally shared margin between inotera and us. under these agreements, we purchased $504 million and $1.43 billion of dram products from inotera in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represented 9% of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2017 and 30% for 2016.

percentages are of total net sales but may not total 100% due to rounding.
cnbu sales for 2018 increased 77% as compared to 2017 due to strong market conditions and demand in key markets, including cloud server, client, enterprise server markets, and graphics markets, which drove increases in pricing and sales volumes. sales into cloud and graphics markets more than doubled in 2018 as compared to 2017. mbu sales for 2018, which were comprised primarily of mobile lpdram and managed nand products, increased 49% as compared to 2017 primarily due to customer qualifications for lpdram and managed nand products, which combined with higher memory content in smartphones to drive improvements in dram pricing and increases in sales volumes. sbu sales of trade nand products for 2018 increased 13% as compared to 2017 driven by higher sales of ssd storage products, which increased by 72%, partially offset by declines in sbu nand component sales from a strategic reallocation of supply from component sales to ssd and mobile managed nand products. increases in sbu sales volumes for 2018 resulting from strong demand for cloud and enterprise ssd markets more than offset declines in selling prices. sbu sales also include "non-trade" products consisting of products manufactured and sold to intel through imft under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost, which included 3d xpoint memory and nand products, aggregating $541 million, $553 million, and $501 million, for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. ebu sales for 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017 primarily due to strong demand across ebu's primary markets including consumer, industrial multimarkets, and automotive. ebu sales were comprised of products incorporating dram, nand, and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue.
cnbu sales for 2017 increased 90% as compared to 2016 due to increases in average selling prices due to strong demand across key markets, growth in the cloud market driven by significant increases in dram content per server, and increases in sales of our gddr5 and gddr5x products into the graphics market driven by strong demand from the gaming industry. mbu sales for 2017 increased 72% as compared to 2016 primarily due to significant increases in sales volumes, driven by customer qualifications for lpdram and managed nand products, combined with higher memory content in smartphones and growth in sales of emcp products. mbu sales growth in 2017 was partially offset by declines in average selling prices for trade nand products. sbu sales of trade nand products for 2017 increased 41% as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in sales volumes from strong demand, particularly for component nand and client and cloud ssd storage products, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. sbu sales of ssd storage products increased by 137% for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the launch of new ssd products incorporating our tlc 3d nand technology. ebu sales for 2017 increased 39% as compared to 2016 primarily due to strong demand and higher sales volumes for dram and emcp in consumer markets and dram and emmc products in the automotive markets.

percentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for each business unit.
cnbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes resulting from strong demand for our products combined with manufacturing cost reductions. mbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to increases in pricing and sales volumes for lpdram products, higher sales of high-value managed nand products, and manufacturing cost reductions. sbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions enabled by our execution in transitioning to 64-layer tlc 3d nand products and improvements in product mix. sbu operating income for 2018 was adversely impacted by higher costs associated with imft's production of 3d xpoint memory products at less than full capacity. ebu operating income for 2018 increased as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, and increases in sales volumes, partially offset by higher r&d costs.
cnbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to improved pricing from strong market conditions, manufacturing cost reductions, and product mix. mbu operating income for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher r&d costs and declines in average selling prices for trade nand products. sbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. ebu operating income for 2017 increased as compared to 2016 as a result of manufacturing cost reductions, which outpaced declines in average selling prices, and increases in sales volumes.
operating expenses and other selling, general, and administrative sg&a expenses for 2018 were 9% higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in legal costs, technical and consulting fees, and employee compensation. sg&a expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to increases in employee compensation as well as transaction costs related to the inotera acquisition.
research and development r&d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. r&d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.
r&d expenses for 2018 were 17% higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in employee compensation, volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers, and depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending. r&d expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers and increases in employee compensation, partially offset by lower engineering and other professional services costs.
we share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel. we continue to jointly develop nand technologies with intel through the third generation of 3d nand, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. in the second quarter of 2018, we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs. we continue to jointly develop 3d xpoint technologies with intel through the second generation of 3d xpoint technology, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. to better optimize 3d xpoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our customers and shareholders, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with intel
31
subsequent generations of 3d xpoint technology. as a result of the above actions, we expect reimbursements under our cost-sharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019. our r&d expenses were reduced by reimbursements under these development partner arrangements by $201 million, $213 million, and $205 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") which lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and significantly affects how income from foreign operations is taxed in the united states. our u.s. statutory federal rate was 25.7% for 2018 (based on the 35% corporate rate through december 31, 2017 and 21% from that date through the end of fiscal year 2018) and will be 21% beginning in 2019. the tax act imposed a one-time transition tax in 2018 on accumulated foreign income (the "repatriation tax"); provided a u.s. federal tax exemption on foreign earnings distributed to the united states after january 1, 2018; and beginning in 2019, created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets (the "foreign minimum tax"). the tax act allows us to elect to pay any repatriation tax due in eight annual, interest-free payments in increasing amounts beginning in december 2018. in connection with the provisions of the tax act, we made an accounting policy election to treat the foreign minimum tax provision as a period cost in the period the tax is incurred.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") allows the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if our analyses of the impacts of the tax act have not been completed when our financial statements are issued. the provisional amounts below for 2018 represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the tax act for which our analysis is not yet complete. as we complete our analysis of the tax act, including collecting, preparing, and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations, and obtaining additional guidance from the irs, u.s. treasury department, fasb, or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the tax act, we may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. in accordance with sab 118, our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. at august 30, 2018, there were no provisions for which we were unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact.

our income taxes reflect various impacts of the tax act, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower u.s. corporate rate of 25.7% for 2018 and 21% for subsequent years and provisional estimates for the repatriation tax and the release of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our u.s. operations. our income tax rates also include operations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates. beginning in 2019, our effective tax rate may increase to the low teens percentage depending on the amount and geographic mix of taxable income. income taxes for 2018, 2017, and 2016 included tax benefits of $1 million, $28 million, and $58 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions.
during 2018, we reassessed our capital structure, including our board of directors' authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019, the future cash needs of our global operations, and the effects of the tax act. as a result of this reassessment, we deemed a portion of our foreign earnings to be no longer indefinitely reinvested. as a result of the repatriation tax, substantially all of our accumulated foreign earnings prior to december 31, 2017
32
were subject to u.s. federal taxation. although these earnings have been subject to u.s. federal income tax under the repatriation tax, the repatriation to the united states of all or a portion of these earnings would potentially be subject to foreign withholding and state income tax. as of august 30, 2018, we had a deferred tax liability of $82 million associated with our undistributed earnings.
we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions outside the unites states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2031, that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. the effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.96 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $1.59) for 2018, by $742 million ($0.64 per diluted share) for 2017, and were not material in 2016.

other net interest expense decreased 60% for 2018 as compared to 2017 due to decreases in debt obligations and increases in interest income. net interest expense increased 42% for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in debt obligations, including our borrowings of 80 billion new taiwan dollars in december 2016 in connection with our acquisition of inotera and $1.25 billion from the issuance of our 2023 secured notes in april 2016.
further discussion of other operating and non-operating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements":
•   equity plans
•   research and development
•   other operating income (expense), net
•   other non-operating income (expense), net liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. we expect, from time to time, to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including the issuance of securities. we have an undrawn revolving credit facility that expires in july 2023 and provides for borrowings of up to $2.00 billion. we expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months.
to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and r&d. we estimate that capital expenditures in 2019 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be $10.5 billion plus or minus 5%, focused on technology transitions and product enablement. the actual amounts for 2019 will vary depending on market conditions. as of august 30, 2018, we had commitments of approximately $1.8 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year.
in may 2018, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019. we may purchase shares on a discretionary basis through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stock.
from august 31, 2018 through october 12, 2018, we repurchased an aggregate of $1.65 billion of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement, a rule 10b5-1plan, and through open market repurchases. pursuant to the asr, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase $1.00 billion of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the number of shares ultimately purchased will be calculated by dividing $1.00 billion by a volume-weighted average price of our common stock from september 5, 2018 through as late as november 29, 2018 (the
33
"measurement period"), subject to an agreed-upon discount. on september 5, 2018, we paid $1.00 billion to the financial institution and received an initial installment of 14 million shares, with the final share amount to be determined as of the end of the measurement period.
see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity."
cash and marketable investments totaled $7.28 billion and $6.05 billion as of august 30, 2018 and august 31, 2017, respectively. our investments consist primarily of money market funds and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. to mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. as of august 30, 2018, $3.08 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
limitations on the use of cash and investments mmj group: cash and marketable investments as of august 30, 2018 included $1.67 billion held by the mmj group. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in march 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj group is prohibited from paying dividends to us. in addition, pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court, the mmj group cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to the approval of the legal trustee. as a result, the assets of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the tokyo district court.
imft: cash and marketable investments included $91 million held by imft as of august 30, 2018. our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations. amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations.
indefinitely reinvested: as of august 30, 2018, $1.71 billion of cash and marketable investments, including substantially all of the amounts held by mmj, was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

operating activities: for 2018, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included a $1.73 billion increase in receivables due to a higher level of net sales.
for 2017, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included a $1.65 billion increase in receivables due to a higher level of net sales, $361 million of payments attributed to intercompany balances in connection with the inotera acquisition, and a $564 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
for 2016, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included a $465 million decrease in receivables due to a lower level of net sales, offset by an increase of $549 million in inventories.
34
investing activities: for 2018, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $7.99 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (net of partner contributions), partially offset by $164 million of net inflows from sales, maturities, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.
for 2017, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $4.73 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (net of partner contributions), $2.63 billion of net cash paid for the inotera acquisition (net of $361 million of payments attributed to intercompany balances with inotera included in operating activities), and $269 million of net outflows from sales, maturities, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.
for 2016, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $5.75 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (net of partner contributions) and $148 million for the acquisition of tidal systems, ltd., partially offset by $2.66 billion of net inflows from sales, maturities, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.
financing activities: for 2018, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash payments to reduce our debt, including $9.42 billion to prepay or repurchase debt and settle conversions of notes and $774 million for scheduled repayment of other notes and capital leases. cash used for financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds of $1.36 billion from the issuance of 34 million shares of our common stock for $41.00 per share in a public offering and $1.01 billion of proceeds from imft member debt.
for 2017, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $2.48 billion of net proceeds from the 2021 mstw term loan, and $795 million of net proceeds from the 2021 msac term loan, partially offset by $1.63 billion to repurchase notes, repayments of $381 million of capital lease obligations, repayments of $550 million of other debt and convertible notes, and payments of $519 million on equipment purchase contracts.
for 2016, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $2.20 billion of proceeds from issuance of notes and $765 million from equipment sale-leaseback financing transactions, partially offset by repurchase of $870 million of debt and $125 million for the open-market repurchase of 7 million shares of our common stock.

(1)   amounts include mmj creditor payments, convertible notes, and other notes.
(2)   amounts include principal and interest.
(3)   amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year.
(4)   purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services. if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table. if the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, only the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation. contracted minimum amounts specified in any take-or-pay contracts were included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.
(5)   amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $375 million for the current portion of these long-term liabilities. we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities; therefore, the amount has been excluded from the preceding table. however, other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities.
the timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is based on current information. any redemptions, repurchases, or conversions of debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity - micron shareholders' equity - outstanding capped calls."
we have an asr agreement with a financial institution to purchase $1.00 billion of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity - micron shareholders' equity - common stock repurchase authorization - accelerated share repurchase."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
business acquisitions: accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. we typically obtain independent third party
36
valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, discount rates, and comparable market values. items involving significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include the following:
•   debt, including discount rate and timing of payments;
•   deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;
•   fair value of consideration paid or transferred;
•   intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology, and discount rates;
•   inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales, and completion costs for work in process; and
•   property, plant, and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model.
consolidation: we have interests in entities that are vies. determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, we are required to consolidate it. to determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances. our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments.
contingencies: we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. in accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods.
goodwill and intangible assets: we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value.
determining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. the same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. we test the reasonableness of the output of our long-range planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices, analysts' consensus pricing, and management's expectations. these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, including future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, and discount rates.
37
income taxes: we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable fiscal year. we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. in recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and the united states. our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. to project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends, and other information. when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. for example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately $577 million as of august 30, 2018. due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes; as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.
u.s. gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. the amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize inventories primarily as memory (including dram, nand, and other memory).
property, plant, and equipment: we review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition. in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes. in addition, significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.
we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation expense at the time by approximately $100 million per quarter. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - significant accounting policies.")
research and development: costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as r&d as incurred. determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment by us. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold.
stock-based compensation: stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period. for performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being
38
achieved. we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment.
determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life. we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time. a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. we use the black-scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan ("espp"). we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.

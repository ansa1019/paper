management overview iac has majority ownership of both match group, which includes tinder, match, plentyoffish and okcupid, and angi homeservices, which includes homeadvisor, angie's list and handy, and also operates vimeo, dotdash and the daily beast, among many other online businesses.
sources of revenue mtch's revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time. revenue is also derived from à la carte features, where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.
angi revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by homeadvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by homeadvisor service professionals. consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. effective with the combination (described below), revenue is also derived from angie's list (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers.
vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly software-as-a-service ("saas") subscription fees paid by creators for premium capabilities and, to a lesser extent, sales of live streaming hardware, software and professional services.
dotdash revenue consists principally of digital advertising revenue and affiliate commerce commission revenue. digital advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly and through programmatic advertising networks. affiliate commerce commission revenue is generated when dotdash refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction.
a meaningful portion of the revenue of the desktop business within the applications segment and the ask media group within the emerging & other segment is attributable to a services agreement with google inc. ("google"). the services agreement became effective on april 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement, and expires on march 31, 2020. on february 11, 2019, the company and google amended the services agreement, effective as of april 1, 2020. the amendment extends the expiration date of the agreement to march 31, 2023; provided that beginning september 2020 and each september thereafter, either party may, after discussion with the other party, terminate the services agreement, effective on september 30 of the year following the year such notice is given. the services agreement requires that the company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by google. google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. google's policy changes related to its chrome browser became effective on september 12, 2018 and negatively impacted the distribution of our business-to-consumer ("b2c") desktop products. the impact of these changes on revenue and profits in 2018 were modest as the company optimized marketing spend in anticipation of the changes. however, we expect these changes to reduce revenue and profits of the desktop business in the future, which among other reasons led to a $27.7 million impairment of the related indefinite-lived intangible asset in the fourth quarter of 2018. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, consolidated revenue earned from google was $825.2 million, $740.7 million and $824.4 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenue earned from google represents 73%, 83% and 87% of applications revenue and 94%, 96% and 96% of ask media group revenue (and 68%, 48% and 35% of emerging & other revenue), respectively.
36
revenue for the other businesses within the emerging & other segment is generated primarily through media production and distribution, advertising and subscriptions. for periods prior to their sales: dictionary.com and pricerunner's revenue was derived principally from advertising. electus revenue was primarily generated through media production and distribution. the princeton review's revenue was primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services. shoebuy's revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales.
strategic partnerships, advertiser relationships and online advertising most of the company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with google described above. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, revenue earned from google represents 19%, 22% and 26%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
we pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to apple and google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and payments made to partners who distribute our business-to-business customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. we also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites such as facebook. in addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. these distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
we market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.

2018 consolidated results
•   revenue increased $955.7 million, or 29%, to $4.3 billion due primarily to growth from mtch of $399.2 million, an increase from angi of $395.9 million due, in part, to the combination (defined below), and increases of $59.7 million from emerging &amp; other, $56.3 million from vimeo and $40.1 million from dotdash.
•   operating income increased $376.7 million, or 200%, to $565.1 million due primarily to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $413.5 million, a decrease of $26.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, and a change of $4.3 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by increases of $66.3 million in amortization of intangibles and $1.1 million in depreciation. the decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease of $51.4 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the combination ($70.6 million in 2018 compared to $122.1 million in 2017), partially offset by the modification of certain awards in 2018, due in part, to the sale of businesses during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017. the increase in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to the combination and the inclusion in 2018 of an impairment charge of $27.7 million at applications related to a trade name at the desktop business.
•   adjusted ebitda increased $413.5 million, or 72%, to $988.8 million due primarily to growth of $209.6 million from angi, $185.0 million from mtch, $24.1 million from dotdash and $10.3 million from emerging &amp; other, partially offset by a decrease of $4.9 million from applications and increased losses of $6.3 million and $4.4 million from corporate and vimeo, respectively.

mtch revenue increased 30% to $1.7 billion driven by international direct revenue growth of $234.8 million, or 43%, and north america direct revenue growth of $161.1 million, or 22%. both international and north america direct revenue growth were driven by higher average subscribers, up 31% to 3.7 million and 17% to 4.2 million, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in subscribers at tinder. total arpu increased 6% due to tinder, as subscribers purchased premium subscriptions, such as tinder gold, as well as additional à la carte features.
angi revenue increased 54% to $1.1 billion driven by the marketplace growth of $193.1 million, or 33%, the contribution from angie's list and growth of $12.6 million, or 22%, at the european businesses. marketplace revenue growth was driven by a 30% increase in marketplace service requests to 23.5 million and a 18% increase in marketplace paying sps to 214,000. angie's list revenue reflects the write-off of deferred revenue due to the combination of $5.5 million in 2018 compared to $7.8 million in 2017. revenue growth at the european businesses was driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in mybuilder on march 24, 2017, as well as growth across other regions. european revenue also benefited from the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro.
vimeo revenue grew 54% to $159.6 million due to platform revenue growth of $47.0 million, or 47%, and hardware revenue growth of $9.3 million, both due in part, to the contribution of livestream. platform revenue growth was further impacted by a 9% increase in vimeo ending subscribers to 952,000 and average revenue per user growth of 31%.
dotdash revenue grew 44% to $131.0 million due to strong advertising growth across several verticals, particularly verywell and the spruce, as well as growth in affiliate commerce commission revenue.
applications revenue increased 1% to $582.3 million due to an increase of $67.7 million, or 121%, in mosaic group, partially offset by a decline of $63.4 million, or 12%, in desktop. the increase in mosaic group revenue was driven primarily by growth of 55% related to the ongoing transition to subscription products as well as higher marketing expense and new products, contributions from itranslate and teltech, and the transfer of daily burn from the emerging & other segment effective april 1, 2018. the decline at desktop was driven by the business-to-business partnership operations' loss of certain partners and a decrease in the direct-to-consumer desktop applications business due primarily to lower revenue per query. the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 resulted in a net increase in revenue of $0.8 million (an increase of $7.3 million in mosaic group, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in desktop).
emerging & other revenue increased 13% to $528.3 million due primarily to higher revenue at ask media group due to growth in paid traffic, primarily in international markets, and the contribution from bluecrew, partially offset by the sales of electus and dictionary.com in the fourth quarter of 2018, the sale of the princeton review in 2017, lower revenue from iac films due to the sale of a film in the third quarter of 2017 and the transfer of daily burn.

for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017
operating income in 2018 increased from 2017 due primarily to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $413.5 million described below, a decrease of $26.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and a change of $4.3 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by increases of $66.3 million in amortization of intangibles and $1.1 million in depreciation. the decrease in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to a decrease of $51.4 million in modification and acceleration charges related to the combination ($70.6 million in 2018 compared to $122.1 million in 2017) and the inclusion in 2017 of a modification charge related to a homeadvisor equity award, partially offset by the modification of certain awards in 2018, due in part, to the sale of businesses during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2017. the increase in amortization of intangibles reflects an increase in amortization expense of $39.4 million related to the combination, the inclusion in 2018 of an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $27.7 million at applications related to a trade name at the desktop business and an increase in amortization expense of $4.0 million related to the acquisition of livestream, partially offset by a dotdash definite-lived trade name that became fully amortized in 2017. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at desktop was due to google's policy changes related to its chrome browser which became effective on september 12, 2018 and have negatively impacted the distribution of our business to consumer desktop products.
at december 31, 2018, there was $326.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.3 years.
for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
operating income in 2017 increased from a loss in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a goodwill impairment charge of $275.4 million at iac publishing (which in connection with the company's realignment of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 was allocated to the dotdash and the emerging & other reportable segments based upon their relative fair values as of october 1, 2018), an increase of $74.1 million in adjusted ebitda described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, a change of $3.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and an increase of $2.6 million in depreciation expense. the goodwill impairment charge at iac publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense in 2017 as a result of a dotdash trade name and certain intangible assets from the plentyoffish acquisition becoming fully amortized and impairment charges in 2016 of $9.0 million and $2.6 million related to certain dictionary.com and dotdash indefinite-lived trade names, respectively, partially offset by expense in 2017 related to the combination. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to an increase of $140.3 million at angi due primarily to the modification and acceleration charges related to the combination, as well as an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled during the third quarter of 2017, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2016.

for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017
mtch adjusted ebitda increased 39% to $653.9 million due primarily to the increase of $399.2 million in revenue due to growth at tinder, and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due primarily to the ongoing shift towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by higher in-app purchase fees as revenues are increasingly sourced through mobile app stores and higher litigation costs.
angi adjusted ebitda increased 554% to $247.5 million due primarily to the increase of $395.9 million in revenue, a reduction in transaction and integration-related costs principally related to the combination of $39.1 million and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount following the combination, and increases of $21.7 million in cost of revenue, $19.7 million in bad debt expense, $15.2 million in software license and maintenance cost and $9.4 million in facilities costs. additionally, adjusted ebitda in 2018 benefited from a reduction in sales commissions expense of $4.9 million due to the adoption of asu no. 2014-09.

angi adjusted ebitda decreased 17% to $37.9 million, despite an increase of $237.5 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expense, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increase headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher marketplace revenue, outsourced customer service expense, software license and maintenance costs, and higher losses at the european businesses driven primarily by its expansion strategy. adjusted ebitda in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the combination of $7.8 million.

in 2018, the company recorded an income tax provision of $3.8 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 1%. the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 21% due primarily to excess tax benefits generated by the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards and the finalized transition tax.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act subjected to u.s. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017 ("transition tax") and implemented a number of changes that took effect on january 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") earned by foreign subsidiaries. the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. in the third quarter of 2018, the company finalized this calculation, which resulted in a $9.2 million reduction in the transition tax. the net reduction in the transition tax was due primarily to the utilization of additional foreign tax credits and a reduction in state taxes, partially offset by additional taxable earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries based on recently issued internal revenue service guidance. the adjustment of the company's provisional tax expense was recorded as a change in estimate in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act, which was also included in asu no. 2018-05, income taxes (topic 740), amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118"), which was adopted by the company upon issuance in march 2018. despite the completion of the company's accounting for the tax act under sab 118, many aspects of the law remain unclear and we expect ongoing guidance to be issued at both the federal and state levels. we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of any new developments.
in 2017, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $291.1 million, which was due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of asu no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, on january 1, 2017 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the effect of the tax act. under asu no. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the exercise, purchase or settlement of stock-based awards of $361.8 million in 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
in 2016, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%. the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of shoebuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the dotdash and emerging & other segments.

principles of financial reporting iac reports adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. we believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results. iac endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-gaap measure presented by providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-gaap measure. we encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non-gaap measure, which we discuss below.
definition of non-gaap measure adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. we believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are non-cash in nature. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated statement of operations of certain expenses.
the following table reconciles net earnings (loss) attributable to iac shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated adjusted ebitda:

non-cash expenses that are excluded from our non-gaap measure stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the combination), of stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), performance-based rsus and market-based awards. these expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. performance-based rsus and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). to the extent that stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, the company remits the required tax-withholding amounts from its current funds.
52
depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the combination). at the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as technology, service professional and contractor relationships, customer lists and user base, memberships, trade names and content, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

increase in other assets is primarily related to an increase in production costs at iac films. the increase in deferred revenue is mainly due to growth in subscription sales at mtch, angi and vimeo. the increase in income taxes payable and receivable is primarily due to receipt of 2015 capital loss refund in 2016 and 2016 income tax accruals in excess of 2016 income tax payments, partially offset by payment of 2015 tax liabilities in 2016.
net cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from the sale of businesses, investments and assets of $172.2 million, which mainly relate to the sales of pricerunner and shoebuy, partially offset by capital expenditures of $78.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at mtch and angi to support their products and services, as well as leasehold improvements and computer hardware, purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable debt securities of $61.6 million, and cash used in acquisitions and purchases of investments of $31.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities includes $450.0 million in principal payments on mtch debt, $308.9 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million shares, on a settlement date basis, of iac common stock at an average price of $49.74 per share, $126.4 million in principal payments on iac debt and $29.8 million and $26.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of mtch and iac employees, respectively, for stock-based awards that were net settled, partially offset by $400.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of mtch debt and $39.4 million and $25.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of mtch and iac stock options, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash flows generated from operations and available borrowings under the iac credit facility. iac's consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2018 were $2.3 billion, of which $186.9 million was held by mtch and $361.9 million was held by angi. the company generated $988.1 million of operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018, of which $603.5 million was generated by mtch and $223.7 million was generated by angi. each of mtch and angi is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the company with funds. as a result, the company cannot freely access the cash of mtch and angi and their respective subsidiaries. in addition, agreements governing mtch and angi indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders, including the company, in the event a default has occurred or in the case of mtch, its secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the mtch term loan) exceeds 2.0 to 1.0 or its consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the mtch indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0, and in the case of angi, its consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the angi term loan) exceeds 4.5 to 1.0. there were no such limitations at december 31, 2018.
on december 7, 2018, the mtch $500 million revolving credit facility was amended and restated, and now expires on december 7, 2023. at december 31, 2018, the outstanding borrowings under the mtch credit facility were $260.0 million which bear interest at libor plus 1.50%, or approximately 4.00%. borrowings under the mtch credit facility were repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.625% mtch senior notes issued on february 15, 2019. on november 5, 2018, angi entered into a five-year $250 million revolving credit facility. the annual commitment fee on undrawn funds is currently 25 basis points and is based on the consolidated net leverage ratio most recently reported. borrowings under the angi credit facility bear interest, at angi's option, at either a base rate or libor, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on angi's consolidated net leverage ratio. at december 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the angi credit facility. on november 5, 2018, the angi term loan was amended and restated, and is now due on november 5, 2023. on november 5, 2018, the iac credit facility was amended and restated, reducing the facility size from $300 million to $250 million, and now expires on november 5, 2023. there were no outstanding borrowings under the iac credit facility at december 31, 2018.
the company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. the company's 2019 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2018 by approximately 25% to 30%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures for angi related to the development of capitalized software to support its products and services, and leasehold improvements related to the expansion of office space at mtch's tinder business.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, iac repurchased 0.5 million shares, on a trade date basis, of its common stock at an average price of $152.23 per share, or $82.9 million in aggregate. iac has 8.0 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. iac may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors iac management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
57
during the year ended december 31, 2018, mtch repurchased 3.1 million shares, on a trade date basis, of its common stock at an average price of $43.72 per share, or $133.5 million in aggregate. mtch has 2.9 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
on february 6, 2019, the board of directors of angi authorized angi to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock.
the company has granted stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. these equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in iac shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. the number of iac common shares that would be required to settle these vested and unvested interests, other than for mtch, angi and their subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, at february 1, 2019, is 0.1 million shares. withholding taxes, which will be paid by the company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $16.0 million at february 1, 2019, assuming a 50% withholding rate. the number of iac common shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in the company's stock price and the determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than the company's estimate. the company's rsus are awards in the form of phantom shares or units denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of iac common stock. these equity awards are settled on a net basis. the number of iac common shares that would be required to settle these awards at february 1, 2019 is 0.2 million shares. withholding taxes, which will be paid by the company on behalf of the employees upon vest, would have been $43.1 million at february 1, 2019, assuming a 50% withholding rate.
the company has historically settled its stock options on a gross basis. assuming all stock options outstanding on february 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, the company would have remitted $428.9 million (of which $270.3 million is related to vested stock options and $158.6 million is related to unvested stock options) in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).
the company's publicly traded subsidiaries have also granted equity awards denominated in the shares of those subsidiaries, some of which may be settled using iac shares.
mtch currently settles substantially all equity awards on a net basis. assuming all mtch equity awards outstanding on february 1, 2019 were net settled on that date, mtch would have issued 10.2 million common shares (of which 2.0 million is related to vested shares and 8.1 million is related to unvested shares) and would have remitted $556.2 million (of which $110.7 million is related to vested shares and $445.4 million is related to unvested shares) in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). if mtch decided to issue a sufficient number of shares to cover the $556.2 million employee withholding tax obligation, 10.2 million additional shares would be issued by mtch. certain mtch stock options ("tandem awards") can be settled in mtch or iac common stock at the company's election. assuming all vested and unvested tandem awards outstanding on february 1, 2019 were exercised on that date and settled using iac stock, 0.4 million iac common shares would have been issued in settlement and mtch would have issued 1.5 million shares, which is included in the amount above, to iac as reimbursement.
in connection with the combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights related to the common stock of homeadvisor (us) were converted into angi stock appreciation rights that are settleable, at angi's option, on a net basis with angi remitting withholding taxes on behalf of the employee or on a gross basis with angi issuing a sufficient number of class a shares to cover the withholding taxes. in addition, at iac's option, these awards can be settled in either class a shares of angi or shares of iac common stock. if settled in iac common stock, angi reimburses iac in either cash or through the issuance of class a shares to iac. assuming all of the stock appreciation rights outstanding on february 1, 2019 were net settled on that date using iac stock, 1.0 million iac common shares would have been issued in settlement and iac would have been issued 13.0 million shares of angi class a stock and angi would have remitted $219.6 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate). if angi decided to issue a sufficient number of shares to cover the $219.6 million employee withholding tax obligation, 13.0 million additional class a shares would be issued by angi. angi's cash withholding obligation on all other angi net settled awards outstanding on february 1, 2019 is $38.5 million (assuming a 50% withholding rate), which is the equivalent of 2.3 million shares.
prior to the combination in 2017, the company issued a number of iac denominated psus to certain angi employees. vesting of the psus is contingent upon angi's performance. assuming all of the psus outstanding on february 1, 2019 were net settled on that date using iac stock, 0.1 million iac common shares would have been issued in settlement, iac would have been issued 0.7 million shares of angi class a stock and angi would have remitted $12.0 million in cash for withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate).
58
as of december 31, 2018, iac's economic and voting interest in mtch is 81.1% and 97.6%, respectively, and in angi is 83.9% and 98.1%, respectively. as described above, certain mtch and angi equity awards can be settled either in iac common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at iac's election. the company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in iac shares to maintain an economic interest in both mtch and angi of at least 80% and to otherwise take such other steps as necessary to maintain an economic interest in each of mtch and angi of at least 80%.
the company does not expect to be a full u.s. federal cash income tax payer until 2022. the ultimate timing is dependent primarily on the performance of the company and the amount and timing of tax deductions related to stock-based awards.
at december 31, 2018, all of the company's international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences. during the year ended december 31, 2018, international cash totaling $396.2 million was repatriated to the u.s.
the company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available borrowings under the iac credit facility and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services. the company's indebtedness could limit its ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions or capital expenditures, or invest in other areas, such as developing business opportunities. the company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company or at all.

critical accounting policies and estimates the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of iac's accounting policies contained in "note 2-summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8-consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in regard to significant areas of judgment. management of the company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from these estimates. because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
business combinations and contingent consideration arrangements acquisitions are an important part of the company's growth strategy. the company invested $243.3 million (including the value of angi homeservices class a common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of handy), $912.1 million (including the value of angi class a common stock issued in connection with the combination) and $36.1 million in acquisitions in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. the fair value of these intangible assets is based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. the excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
in connection with certain business combinations, the company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. each of these arrangements is initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. the contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. the company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. the changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in "general and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is the company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $458.1 million and $459.1 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of october 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. in performing its annual assessment, the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2018, a qualitative assessment of the mtch, angi, vimeo, college humor media and bluecrew reporting units' goodwill was performed because the company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. the primary factors that the company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:
•   mtch's october 1, 2018 market capitalization of $15.7 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $15.1 billion and mtch's strong operating performance.
•   angi's october 1, 2018 market capitalization of $10.7 billion exceeded its carrying value by approximately $9.6 billion and angi's strong operating performance.
•   the company performed valuations of the vimeo, college humor media and bluecrew reporting units during 2018. these valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity awards that are denominated in the equity of these businesses. the valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, october 1, 2018. the fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its october 1, 2018 carrying value.
61
the company tests goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment. for the company's annual goodwill test at october 1, 2018, the company quantitatively tested the desktop and mosaic group reporting units (included in the applications segment). the company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of these reporting units is in excess of their respective carrying values; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. the company's dotdash, ask media group and the daily beast reporting units have no goodwill.
the aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 110% of their carrying values is approximately $265.1 million.
the annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the company's reporting unit that is being tested to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded.
the fair value of the company's reporting units (except for mtch and angi described above) is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("dcf") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of october 1 each year. the company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its non-public subsidiary denominated stock-based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. determining fair value using a dcf analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. the expected cash flows used in the dcf analyses are based on the company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. assumptions used in the dcf analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of the company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 15% in 2018 and 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017. determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. from the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. while a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
while the company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of october 1. the company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty dcf valuation analysis. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the discount rates used in the dcf analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. the royalty rates used in the dcf analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the company's trade names and trademarks. assumptions used in the avoided royalty dcf analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. the discount rates used in the company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10.5% to 35% in 2018 and 11% to 16% in 2017, and the royalty rates used ranged from 0.75% to 8.0% in 2018 and 2% to 7% in 2017.
the aggregate indefinite-lived intangible asset balance for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 110% of their carrying values is approximately $131.3 million.
the 2018 annual assessment of goodwill did not identify any impairments. the 2018 annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets identified impairment charges of $27.7 million and $1.1 million related to certain desktop and college humor media indefinite-lived trade names, respectively. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at desktop was due to google's policy changes related to its chrome browser which became effective on september 12, 2018 and have negatively impacted the distribution of our b2c downloadable desktop products. the impairment charge related to the b2c trade name was identified in our annual impairment assessment as of october 1, 2018 and reflects the projected reduction in profits and revenues and the resultant reduction in the assumed royalty rate from these policy changes. the impairment charges are included in "amortization of intangibles" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
the 2017 annual assessments did not identify any impairments.
62
while the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire $275.4 million at iac publishing. in connection with the company's realignment of its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2018, $198.3 million and $77.0 million was allocated to the dotdash and the emerging & other reportable segments, respectively, based upon their relative fair values as of october 1, 2018. in addition, amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of impairment charges in 2016 of $9.0 million and $2.6 million related to certain dictionary.com and dotdash indefinite-lived trade names, respectively.
recoverability and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, the company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. the carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $492.1 million and $519.8 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of the company's net deferred tax asset is $41.2 million and $31.3 million, respectively.
the company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. recognition (step one) occurs when the company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. de-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $52.3 million and $39.7 million, respectively. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustment and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
the ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
at december 31, 2018, all of the company's international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences. the company has not provided for approximately $1.0 million of foreign deferred taxes for the $103.1 million of the foreign cash earnings that is indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the company reassesses its intention to remit or permanently reinvest these cash earnings each reporting period; any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the company changes this intention. during the year ended december 31, 2018, international cash totaling $396.2 million was repatriated to the u.s.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax act. the tax act imposes a new minimum tax on gilti earned by foreign subsidiaries beginning in 2018. the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") staff q&a, topic 740 no. 5, accounting for global intangible low-taxed income, states that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred. the company elects to recognize the tax on gilti as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.

stock-based compensation the company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $238.4 million, $264.6 million and $104.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. included in stock-based compensation expense in 2018 and 2017 is $70.6 million and $122.1 million, respectively, related to the modification of previously issued homeadvisor equity awards and previously issued angie's list equity awards, both of which were converted into angi homeservices' equity awards in the combination, and the acceleration of certain converted equity awards resulting from the termination of angie's list employees in connection with the combination. the company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the combination) in 2018, 2017 and 2016 using a black-scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. for stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. the impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2018, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $3.8 million, $17.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively. the company also issues rsus and performance-based rsus. for rsus, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. for performance-based rsus, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying iac common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
investments in debt and equity securities debt securities the company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. marketable debt securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. the specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of debt securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. the company also invests in non-marketable debt securities as part of its investment strategy. we review our debt securities for impairment each reporting period. the company recognizes an unrealized loss on debt securities in net earnings when the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary. factors we consider in making this determination include the duration, severity and reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery and our intent to sell the debt security. we also consider whether we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered because of credit losses. if an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the debt security will be written down to its fair value and the loss will be recognized within other income (expense), net. the carrying value of marketable debt securities at december 31, 2018 is $123.7 million and consist of treasury discount notes and commercial paper rated a1/p1 or better.
equity securities the company invests in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. our equity securities, other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries and those accounted for under the equity method, are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alternative of asu no. 2016-01, following its adoption on january 1, 2018, with changes recognized within other income (expense), net each reporting period. under the measurement alternative, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer; value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transaction date. an investment will be considered identical or similar if it has identical or similar rights to the equity investments held by the company. the company reviews its equity securities for impairment each reporting period when there are qualitative factors or events that indicate possible impairment. factors we consider in making this determination include negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. once the qualitative indicators are identified and the fair value of the security is below the carrying value, the company writes down the security to its fair value and records the corresponding charge within other income (expense), net. the carrying value of the company's equity securities without readily determinable fair values at december 31, 2018, is $235.1 million and is included in long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. during 2018, the company recognized gross unrealized gains of $129.0 million related to the remeasurement of certain investments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. in addition, during 2018, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $4.9 million related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values and $0.6 million related to an equity method investment. during 2017 and 2016, the company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million and $10.7 million, respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item 7, the risk factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in item 8 of this form 10-k. please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business summary synopsys, inc. provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. we are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (eda) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ics), also known as chips. we also offer semiconductor intellectual property (ip) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. we provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. to complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. these products and services are part of our semiconductor & system design segment.
we are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, media, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. these tools and services are part of our software integrity segment.
our eda and ip customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. while our products are an important part of our customers' development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs.
our software integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. our software integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. our software integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.
despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. we achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships. we recognize our revenue for the software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. for discussion on our revenue recognition policy, please see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements. time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. as a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.
our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our eda products, expanding and proliferating our ip offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. as we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue. in addition, due to our adoption of accounting standard codification 606 (asc 606), "revenue from contracts with customers", in the beginning of fiscal 2019, as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period. nevertheless, the accounting impact has not affected our cash generated from our business. based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.
business segments effective in fiscal 2019, we realigned our business to evaluate the results of our software integrity business separately from our traditional eda and semiconductor ip business. the chief operating decision makers (codms) now regularly review disaggregated information for the following two reportable segments: (1) semiconductor & system design, which includes eda tools, ip products, system integration solutions and other revenue categories, and (2) software integrity, which includes a comprehensive solution for building integrity-security, quality and compliance testing-into our customers' software development lifecycle and supply chain. our historical results have been recast to retrospectively reflect the change from one to two reportable segments.
as a result of the change in reporting structure, financial information provided to and used by the codms to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin for the semiconductor & system design and software integrity segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenues by geographic region.
semiconductor & system design. this segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor ip portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. eda includes digital, custom ic design and field programmable gate array (fpga) design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. designers use these products to automate the ic design process and to reduce errors. for ip, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven ip solutions for system-on-chips (socs). this includes ip that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop socs in these areas.
software integrity. this segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services such as leading quality testing technologies, automated analysis, and consulting experts. beginning in fiscal 2019, we launched the polaris software integrity platformtm, an integrated cloud-based solution that unites key elements to provide an even more valuable way for developers to better develop personalized approaches for open source license compliance and detect and remediate known security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the development process, thereby minimizing risk and maximizing productivity.
fiscal year end our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to october 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. when a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on november 3, 2018. fiscal 2019 and 2017 were 52-week years ending on november 2, 2019 and october 28, 2017, respectively. fiscal 2020 will be a 52-week year.
for presentation purposes, this form 10-k refers to the closest calendar month end.
fiscal 2019 financial performance summary we adopted new revenue guidance, asc 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. the comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated. additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our pro-forma financial results under accounting standards codification 605 (asc 605), "revenue recognition", for fiscal 2019.
in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, our financial performance reflects the following:
•   revenues were $3.4 billion, an increase of $239.6 million or 8%, primarily due to our continued growth organically, as well as the adoption of asc 606, partially offset by additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to the extra week in fiscal 2018;
•   total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.8 billion, an increase of $79.6 million or 3%, primarily due to increases in restructuring costs of $34.2 million and employee-related costs of $81.3 million, resulting from increases in headcount, partially offset by a litigation settlement in fiscal 2018 of $26.0 million and a legal settlement in our favor in fiscal 2019 of $18.3 million;
•   operating income of $520.2 million, an increase of $160.0 million or 44%.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. in preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. our actual results may differ from these estimates. see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:
•   revenue recognition;
•   valuation of business combinations; and
•   income taxes.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. we have concluded that our eda software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. as eda customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers' ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•   the expected use of the acquired assets; and
•   discount rates.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
results of operations we adopted new revenue guidance, asc 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. the comparative information for periods prior to the fiscal 2019 has not been restated. additional comparative information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the adoption of asc 606 and our pro-forma financial results under asc 605 for fiscal 2019.
revenue our revenues are generated from two business segments: the semiconductor & system design segment and the software integrity segment. see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions.
further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:
semiconductor & system design segment this segment is comprised of the following:
•   eda software includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (fpga) ic design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. eda products and services are typically sold through tsl arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. the weighted-average term of the tsls we entered into in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were all 2.7 years, respectively. under asc 606, we have concluded that the software licenses in tsl contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. we recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under tsl contracts ratably over the term of the license. under asc 605, these arrangements were previously recognized ratably over the contract term.
•   ip &amp; system integration includes our designware® ip portfolio and system-level products and services. under asc 606, these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed ip and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over a time. revenue allocated to the ip licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our ip. payments for ip contracts are generally received upon delivery of the ip. revenue related to the customization of certain ip is recognized as "professional services." under asc 605, we previously recognized revenues ratably for certain ip licensing and support arrangements.
•   in the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. the first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. the portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. we have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has title to the hardware, physical possession, and a present obligation to pay for the hardware. the portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. the adoption of asc 606 did not change the timing of revenue recognition for hardware products.
•   revenue from professional service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. we have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. the adoption of asc 606 did not change from asc 605 the timing of revenue recognition for professional services.
software integrity segment
•   we sell software integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. the licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide the functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. we will recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.
most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. for example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. no single factor typically drives our customers' buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.

the overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including the timing and value of contract renewals, as well as payment terms for revenue recognized under asc 605. for example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of ip consulting projects, royalties, variability in ip products sales and hardware sales. as revenue from ip products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such ip products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue.
the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories, and higher revenue of $102.5 million recognized under new revenue standard asc 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard asc 605. the increase was partially offset by approximately $46.0 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018.
33
the increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the continued overall growth of our business, mainly due to higher tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, an increase in professional services, additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and contributions from acquired companies.

changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.
the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers and higher ip revenue recognized upfront under asc 606 of $235.4 million.
the increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of ip products driven by higher demand from customers.
upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of ip products and hardware sales. such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements.

our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and variable compensation; changes in amortization; and changes in selling and marketing expenses. the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, and fixed charges including information technology (it) and facilities.
foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, or fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.

we divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. we then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.
cost of products revenue. cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.

cost of maintenance and service revenue. cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. we expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.
the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring, $11.3 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing ip consulting arrangements, $10.1 million in it and facility expenses, and $5.3 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $24.4 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.
the increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $47.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in costs related to servicing ip consulting arrangements, and an increase of $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets, as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a u.s. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a settlement with the internal revenue service (irs) of $21.8 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 64.4%, which included income tax expense of $166.2 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of $825 million, $30.5 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, a settlement with the korean national tax service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of $7.9 million, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $36.4 million. these expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $38.1 million, a u.s. federal research tax credit of $25.5 million, and a settlement with the taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of $10.9 million.
the integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. these intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition.
the tax act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. in fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including altera corp. et al. v. commissioner and the hungarian administrative court ruling, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax. see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements or further discussion.
we continue to obtain, analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the tax act. the applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions are dependent in part on forthcoming irs guidance.

•   a tax on global intangible low-tax income (gilti), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. in fiscal 2019, the company adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of gilti in the period that it is subject to such tax.
•   a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.
•   a special tax deduction for fdii, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the u.s. and derived from foreign sources.
the tax act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. we have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.
in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (the hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. on april 30, 2019, the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary. we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5, 2019.
see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the tax act, and the hungarian audit.
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities.
as of october 31, 2019, we held an aggregate of $191.6 million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and an aggregate of $537.0 million in our foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the tax act, if we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the u.s. in the future, the earnings made after december 31, 2017 would not be subject to further u.s. tax. in addition, we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings of $6.3 million in fiscal 2019, which is sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings.
the following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2019.

cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by repayment of debt, stock repurchases, annual variable compensation payouts, and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows year ended october 31,                                           $ change                 $ change

cash provided by operating activities             $800.5                $424.4                $632.5               $376.1                   $(208.1       )
cash used in investing activities                 $(235.9     )         $(743.5     )         $(189.3     )        $507.6                   $(554.2       )

cash provided by operating activities we expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. we generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.
fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements, higher income taxes payment, higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings, and higher inventory. disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain one-time payments of $163.3 million for income taxes and $65.0 million for a litigation settlement.
cash used in investing activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of $616.0 million.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of $393.4 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $128.1 million.
cash provided by (used in) financing activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of $228.8 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of $427.7 million.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. cash provided by financing activities was higher primarily due to higher proceeds of $300.6 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of $85.3 million.

changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing of customer billing and collection activities.
working capital working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets:

current liabilities         1,752.5                   2,102.4                (349.9    )        (17   )%
working capital (deficit)   $(13.6        )           $(558.6       )        $545.0             (98   )%
increases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in short-term debt of $326.2 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $222.5 million, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $71.9 million, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million.
other commitments - credit and term loan facilities in july 2018, we entered into a 220.0 million rmb (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in china to support our facilities expansion. borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the chinese central bank rate plus 10% of such rate. as of october 31, 2019, we had $17.9 million outstanding under the agreement.
on november 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the credit agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the term loan). the credit agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated may 19, 2015, in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from may 19, 2020 to november 28, 2021. subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the credit agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million. the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. as of october 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.
as of october 31, 2019, we had $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the term loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities. outstanding principal payments under the term loan are due as follows:
fiscal year       (in thousands)
2020       $17,813
2021        27,187
2022        75,000
total      $120,000
as of october 31, 2018, we had $133.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the term loan, of which $120.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. the total outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31, 2018 was $330.0 million, which was included in short-term liabilities.
there was no outstanding balance under the revolver as of october 31, 2019. we expect our borrowings under the revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the credit agreement. as of october 31, 2019, borrowings under the term loan bore interest at libor +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the revolver was libor +1.000%. in addition, commitment fees are payable on the revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.
subsequent to fiscal year 2019, we drew down $160.0 million under the revolver. the total outstanding balance of the revolver as of december 20, 2019 is $160.0 million, net of repayments.
other as of october 31, 2019, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.
we proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average
42
credit rating exceeding aa. the majority of our investments are classified as level 1 or level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. see notes 5 and 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
contractual obligations contractual obligations as of october 31, 2019 are as follows:

(2)   purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october 31, 2019. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(3)   these commitments relate to the principal of the term loan and a credit facility as discussed in other commitments above.
(4)   these other obligations include fees associated with our credit facility.
(5)   long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of october 31, 2019. currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2019 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

overview and 2019 highlights we are a global energy technology company. we deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one intelligent platform. we revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology and we produce a fully integrated solar-plus-storage solution. we have shipped more than 25 million microinverters, and over one million enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 130 countries.
we sell our solutions primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. we also sell directly to large installers, oems, strategic partners and homeowners. our revenue for the second half of 2019 was positively impacted by the scheduled phase-down of the investment tax credit for solar projects under section 48(a) (the "itc") of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). the historical itc percentage was 30% through 2019, and the itc percentage decreased to 26% of the basis of a solar energy system that began construction during 2020, 22% for 2021, and zero for residential and 10% for commercial if construction begins after 2021 or if the solar energy system is placed into service after 2023. as a result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30% investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31, 2019. these safe harbor purchases positively affected our revenues in the second half of 2019 and $49.9 million deferred revenue as of december 31, 2019 relates to safe harbor purchases to be shipped in the first quarter of 2020.
our net revenues were $624.3 million, $316.2 million and $286.2 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we earned net income of $161.1 million for 2019 compared to net losses of $11.6 million and $45.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, we had $251.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $44.7 million in restricted cash and $300.3 million of working capital.
our 2019 priorities included focusing on providing great customer service, high quality products, scaling business processes and profitable top line growth, and development of our ensemble technology. quality and customer service are the cornerstones of our strategy and were instrumental in our turnaround in financial performance in 2018 and 2019. we began by focusing on call center metrics in the u.s., europe and australia, and reduced the average wait time from over 10 minutes in 2017 to 2 minutes in 2018 to under 2 minutes by the end of 2019. we introduced self-service tools such as the service-on-the-gotm that allow our installers and partners to submit requests from their phone in less than 60 seconds.
the launch of our iq 7 series microinverter worldwide, the smallest, lightest and most powerful microinverter we have ever made, was a key factor in improving gross margin. every region of the world where our products are sold is now using this seventh-generation microinverter. during year ended december 31, 2019, 98% of our microinverter shipments were iq 7. we systematically rolled out high-power and high-efficiency variants of the iq 7 microinverters in 2018. selling these variants simultaneously improved gross margin and delivered a better price per watt for the installer.

on january 28, 2019, we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of approximately $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees owed to lenders affiliated with tennenbaum capital partners, llc.
on may 30, 2019, we entered into separately and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of our 4.0% convertible senior notes due 2023 ("notes due 2023") resulting in the repurchase and exchange, as of june 5, 2019, of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the issuance of 10,801,080 shares of common stock and separate cash payments totaling $6.0 million.
on june 5, 2019, we issued $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.0% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the "notes due 2024") in a private placement. the notes due 2024 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 1.0% per year, payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning on december 1, 2019. the notes due 2024 will mature on june 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders. further information relating to the notes due 2024 may be found in note 11, "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k and below under "liquidity and capital resources."
2020 outlook we believe our solid execution in 2019 positions us well to take advantage of future growth opportunities, and we need to maintain our focus in order to capitalize on such opportunities. our top three priorities for 2020 are (i) providing a remarkable customer experience, (ii) introduction of new products and expansion of our markets, and (iii) focus on enhancements to our comprehensive digital platform.
customer experience. quality and customer service constitute customer experience. this has remained a priority for three years running. on the service front, our installer, distributor and module partners are our first line of association with our ultimate customer, the homeowner and business user. our goals are to partner better with these service providers so that we can provide exceptional high quality service to our homeowner. we are convinced that continued reinforcement of customer experience improvements can be a competitive advantage for us.
introduce new products and expand our market. we are focused on residential solar in a dozen countries providing serviceable available market ('sam') of approximately $3.3 billion in 2019. we also plan to introduce new products in 2020 which will take our sam to $12.5 billion in 2022 which will comprise of residential solar, residential storage, small commercial solar and off-grid solar and storage.
expand our digital presence. we are focused on generating revenue through digitalization of the business-to-business and business-to-customer process of the partner and customer journey. future key focus is to expand our digital presence through enhancing our online store, increasing the use of the online store significantly, and releasing a comprehensive digital platform.
components of consolidated statements of operations net revenues we primarily generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter solutions and related accessories, which can include our ac battery storage systems, our envoy communications gateway and enlighten cloud-based monitoring service as well as other accessories.
our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our solutions and related accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.

cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs, freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. our product costs are impacted by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. certain costs, primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
we outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis. we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. however, shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. we contract with third parties, including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the u.s., europe and asia.
gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost, product mix, customer mix, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories other than restructuring expense and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation.
research and development expense include personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs, testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications, networking and software functionality, and storage. we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position.
sales and marketing expense include personnel-related expenses, travel, trade shows, marketing, customer support and other indirect costs. we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. we currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the u.s., canada, mexico, central american markets, europe, australia, new zealand, india and certain other asian markets. we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future.
general and administrative expense include personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, facilities costs, and fees for professional services. fees for professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.
restructuring charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2018-2019 (the "2018 plan") to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expenses. under the 2018 plan, costs included in restructuring primarily consisted of employee severance and one-time benefits, workforce reorganization charges, non-cash charges related to impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves. see note 10. "restructuring," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
other expense, net other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense and fees under our convertible notes and term loans, and non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs. other expense, net also includes interest income on our cash balance and gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into u.s. dollars.

income tax (provision) benefit we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the u.s. because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the u.s. as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the u.s., we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. we regularly assess the ability to realize deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available evidence, including such factors as the history of recent earnings and expected future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, after considering these factors, we determined that the positive evidence overcame any negative evidence, primarily due to cumulative income in recent years, and the expectation of sustained profitability in future periods and concluded that it was more likely than not that the us federal and state deferred tax assets were realizable. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

"income taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2019, we had $251.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $44.7 million in restricted cash and working capital of $300.3 million. cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held in the u.s. were $289.8 million and consisted primarily of u.s. government money market mutual funds and both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. restricted cash represents cash held by us in the form of a certificate of deposit collateralized under a letter of credit we issued to a customer. we consider amounts held outside the u.s. to be accessible and have provided for the estimated u.s. income tax liability associated with our foreign earnings.
term loans on january 28, 2019, we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of approximately $39.5 million plus accrued interest and fees owed to lenders affiliated with tennenbaum capital partners, llc.

convertible notes notes due 2023. in august 2018, we issued $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement ("notes due 2023"). the notes due 2023 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 4.0% per year, payable semi-annually on february 1 and august 1 of each year, beginning on february 1, 2019. the notes due 2023 will mature on august 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders. on may 30, 2019, we entered into separately and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the notes due 2023 resulting in the repurchase and exchange, as of june 5, 2019, of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the issuance of 10,801,080 shares of common stock and separate cash payments totaling $6.0 million. as of december 31, 2019, we had $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of our notes due 2023 outstanding.
notes due 2024. in june 2019, we issued $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement ("notes due 2024"). the notes due 2024 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 1.0% per year, payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning on december 1, 2019. the notes due 2024 will mature on june 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders at a conversion price of $20.50 per share. as of december 31, 2019, we had $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of our notes due 2024 outstanding.
the notes due 2024 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding december 1, 2023, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder under any of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on september 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $26.6513 (130% of the conversion price) on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the "trading price" (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. upon conversion of any of the notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election.
in connection with the offering of the notes due 2024, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions in order to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes due 2024. the total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $36.3 million. also, concurrently with the offering of the notes due 2024, we entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions whereby we issued warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at a strike price of $25.2320 rather than the notes due 2024 conversion price of $20.5010. we received approximately $29.8 million from the sale of the warrants.
as of february 21, 2020, the notes due 2024 were not converted into equity, therefore, we had not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge and the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding. if holders of the notes due 2024 are able to convert the debt to equity, and exercise that right, we have asserted our intent and ability to settle the $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 in cash. see note 11, "debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information relating to the convertible note hedge transactions and warrants.
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $139.1 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $16.1 million in 2018, an increase of $122.9 million year-over-year. the $122.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily due to higher profitability in 2019 of $172.8 million higher net income, partially offset by higher net non-cash benefit of $49.7 million. the higher net non-cash benefit of $49.7 million in 2019, compared to 2018, is comprised of $73.4 million higher deferred income tax benefit due to the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, $0.5 million lower provision for doubtful accounts and $0.5 million lower asset impairment, partially offset by higher non-cash charges for $8.7 million higher stock-based compensation, $6.0 million fees paid for repurchase and exchange of convertible notes due 2023, $2.2 million financing fees on extinguishment of term loans, $4.5 million higher depreciation on property and equipment and $3.4 million higher non-cash interest expense primarily due to debt discount on notes due 2024. the changes in the working capital year-over-year was neutral as our growth in deferred revenue of $78.4 million, including $49.9 million of safe harbor prepayments, was offset by our growth in accounts receivable of $55.2 million and inventory of $25.5 million in 2019, compared to 2018.
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $14.8 million, primarily from purchases of test and assembly equipment to expand our supply capacity and related facility improvements, and capitalized costs related to internal-use software. for the year ended december 31, 2019, purchases of property and equipment totaled $14.8 million, compared to purchases in 2018 of $4.2 million, an increase in purchases of $10.6 million year-over-year. for the year ended december 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities included $15.0 million payment related to the acquisition of sunpower's microinverter business. in 2019, we did not acquire any businesses.
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities of $65.9 million was primarily from $127.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of our notes due 2024, $29.8 million from sale of warrants, $5.0 million net proceeds from employee stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under our employee stock incentive program, partially offset by $45.9 million repayment of our term loan and long-term financing receivable recorded as debt, $36.3 million purchase of bond hedges related to our notes due 2024, $6.0 million fee paid to repurchase and exchange $60.0 million of notes due 2023 and $8.2 million payment of employee withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. for the year ended december 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities of $80.6 million was primarily from net proceeds of $62.4 million received from issuance of convertible debt, $19.8 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock, $5.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of certain long-term financing receivables and $2.8 million net proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock incentive program, partially offset by $10.0 million in debt payments.

(1)   purchase obligations include amounts related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturer procures on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.

off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway, the cloud-based enlighten monitoring service, and ac battery storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners.
on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards codification ("asc") no. 606, "revenue recognition" ("asc 606" or "topic 606") and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of january 1, 2018. the most significant impacts upon adoption of topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized. the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period.
revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers. a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows.
•   products delivered at a point in time. we sell our products to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts. we generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an envoy communications gateway and enlighten service, communications accessories and ac battery storage solutions to distributors, large installers, oems and strategic partners. microinverter units, microinverter accessories, and ac battery storage solutions are delivered to customers at a point in time, and we recognize revenue for these products when we transfer control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.
•   products delivered over time. the sale of an envoy communications gateway includes our enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 6 years. we also sell certain communication accessories that are delivered over time. the revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period, which is typically 5 or 12 years.
we previously sold envoy communications device to certain customers under a long-term financing arrangement. under this financing arrangement, we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue.
we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded.

we record upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset. for contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred. commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue.
see note 3. "revenue recognition," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to revenue recognition.
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). in cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value. market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. we determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory, including customer demand and market conditions. management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market. the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material.
warranty obligations microinverters sold through december 31, 2013
our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product's warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters). on a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability. this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e., failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e., claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e., replacement cost).
estimated failure rates - our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure ("mtfb") estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters, third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time. as units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform. it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user installation. consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. when a microinverter fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. we then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
estimated claim rates - warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.

estimated replacement costs - three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user. because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time (typically between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. we have a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
in addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences. we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. if actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. such increases or decreases could be material.
fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1, 2014
our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. under asc 825, "financial instruments" (also referred to as the "fair value option"), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item. we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1, 2014 at fair value. this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. the expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. in addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. see note 9. "fair value measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
business combinations assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires the company to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. accounting for business acquisitions requires the company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract, meaning that it includes other transaction components. this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction.

intangible assets intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets. intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 9 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. there was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented.
income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. in estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
we assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary. in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. we follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is "more likely than not" to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.

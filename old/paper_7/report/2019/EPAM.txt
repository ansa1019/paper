the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2019 were as follows:
•   we recorded revenues of $2.3 billion, or a 24.5% increase from $1.8 billion in the previous year, negatively impacted by $25.0 million or 1.3% due to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.
•   income from operations grew 23.2% to $302.9 million from $245.8 million in 2018. expressed as a percentage of revenues, income from operations was consistent with last year at 13.2% compared to 13.3%.
•   our effective tax rate was 12.8% compared to 3.8% last year. the provision for income taxes for 2018 was favorably impacted by the recognition of $34.9 million of one-time tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits associated with equity award exercises and vesting in 2019 compared to the same period last year.
•   net income increased 8.7% to $261.1 million compared to $240.3 million in 2018. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income decreased 1.6% compared to last year, which was largely driven by the increase in our effective tax rate.
•   diluted earnings per share increased 6.8% to $4.53 for the year ended december 31, 2019 from $4.24 in 2018.
•   cash provided by operations decreased $4.8 million, or 1.6%, to $287.5 million during 2019 as compared to last year.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report.
revenues - as discussed in note 1 "business and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k, on january 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" (topic 606) as amended using the modified retrospective method. this resulted in different revenue recognition accounting policies applied to the years presented in our consolidated financial statements.
for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018
we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract. consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation's relative standalone selling price. variable consideration usually takes the form of volume-based discounts, service level credits, price concessions or incentives. determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported.
we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements, which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. we generate the majority of our revenues under time-and-material contracts, which are billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer. we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed.
fixed-price contracts include maintenance and support arrangements, which may exceed one year in duration. maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period. fixed-price contracts also include application development arrangements, where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
revenues from licenses which have significant stand-alone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer. revenues from licenses which do not have stand-alone functionality are recognized over time. if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less.
we report gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
for the year ended december 31, 2017
we recognized revenue when the following criteria were met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed; (2) delivery had occurred; (3) the sales price was fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability was reasonably assured. determining whether and when some of these criteria had been satisfied often involved assumptions and judgments that could have had a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenues reported.
we derived our revenues from a variety of service offerings, which represent specific competencies of our delivery professionals. contracts for these services had different terms and conditions based on the scope, deliverables, and complexity of the engagement, which required management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition. fees for these contracts may have been in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. if there was uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services, revenue was deferred until the uncertainty was sufficiently resolved. at the time revenue was recognized, we provided for any contractual deductions and reduced revenue accordingly. the company reported gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
we deferred amounts billed to our customers for revenues not yet earned. such amounts were anticipated to be recorded as revenues when services were performed in subsequent periods. revenues were recorded when services had been provided but billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms.
the majority of our revenues (90.3% of revenues in 2017) were generated under time-and-material contracts whereby revenues were recognized as services were performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues. the majority of such revenues were billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates as actual time was incurred on the project. revenues from fixed-price contracts (8.3% of revenues in 2017) included fixed-price maintenance and support arrangements, which may have exceeded one year in duration and revenues from maintenance and support arrangements were generally recognized ratably over the expected service period. fixed-price contracts also included application development arrangements and revenues from these arrangements were primarily determined using the proportional performance method. in cases where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution was specified by the customer, and the acceptance criteria were not objectively determinable to have been met as the services were provided, revenues were deferred until all acceptance criteria had been met. in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue was recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the customer. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could have affected the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. the significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finite-lived assets. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. the acquired assets typically include customer relationships, software, trade names, non-competition agreements, and assembled workforce and as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
leases - we determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. we perform an assessment and classify the lease as either an operating lease or a financing lease at the lease commencement date with a right-of-use asset ("rou asset") and a lease liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under both classifications.
lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid. the present value is determined by applying the readily determinable rate implicit in the lease or, if not available, the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee. we determine the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee on a lease-by-lease basis by developing an estimated centralized u.s. dollar borrowing rate for a fully collateralized obligation with a term similar to the lease term and adjust the rate to reflect the incremental risk associated with the currency in which the lease is denominated. the development of this estimate includes the use of recovery rates, u.s. risk-free rates, foreign currency/country base rate yields, and a synthetic corporate credit rating of the company developed using regression analysis. our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease. we includes such options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. rou assets are recognized based on the initial measurement of the lease liabilities plus initial direct costs less lease incentives. lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. rou assets are subject to periodic impairment tests.
we have elected a practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. in addition, we elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all classes of lease assets.

revenues we continue to expand our presence across multiple geographies and verticals, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2019, our total revenues grew 24.5% over the previous year to $2.3 billion. this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships. customer concentration continued to decrease with revenues from our top five, top ten and top twenty clients declining as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the previous year. revenue has been positively impacted from the acquisition of test io and other 2019 acquisitions, which contributed 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively to our revenue growth, and negatively impacted by the fluctuations in foreign currency that decreased our revenue growth by 1.3% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the previous year.
we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical, customer location, service arrangement type, and customer concentration.
revenues by vertical we assign our customers into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence, which we label as "emerging verticals". emerging verticals include customers in multiple industries such as energy, utilities, manufacturing, automotive, telecommunications and several others.

during the year ended december 31, 2019, revenues in our largest geography, north america, were $1,390.0 million growing $290.8 million, or 26.5%, from $1,099.2 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2018. revenues from this geography accounted for 60.6% of total revenues in 2019, an increase from 59.6% in the prior year. the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of $1,321.7 million in 2019 compared to $1,029.3 million in 2018.
revenues in our europe geography were $746.9 million, an increase of $134.4 million, or 21.9%, over $612.5 million in the previous year. revenues in this geography accounted for 32.6% of consolidated revenues in 2019 as compared to 33.2% in the previous year. the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom, switzerland and the netherlands generating revenues of $290.0 million, $152.7 million and $88.5 million in 2019, respectively, compared to $200.9 million, $144.4 million and $70.3 million in 2018, respectively. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the u.s. dollar, particularly the euro and the british pound, during 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year negatively impacted revenue growth in the european geography by 3.2%.
during 2019, revenues in the cis geography increased $18.8 million, or 23.0%, from the previous year. the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers in russia, contributing $18.8 million of revenue growth in 2019 compared to the previous year.
revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 2.4% of total revenues in 2019, a level consistent with the prior year.

revenues by customer concentration we have long-standing relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements. revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multi-year projects. while we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers, we continue to focus on diversification of our customer concentration and building up a portfolio of new accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential. we anticipate the contribution of these new accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid- to long-term and offset the potential slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature.
we expect customer concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the long-term. the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated:

revenues by service offering effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) as amended. the adoption of this standard required various disaggregated levels of revenue to be disclosed as presented in note 9 "revenues" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. the standard also required us to consider how management views the business and provide the appropriate disclosures that would be relevant and informative under those views.
our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. we are continually expanding our service capabilities, moving beyond traditional services into business consulting, design and physical product development. as more of our projects involve multiple competencies and different types of specialized professionals working collaboratively, it has been increasingly difficult to classify our projects into the specific service offerings that we historically presented. given the market demand for integrated customer solutions and our management's view of the business, we changed our presentation of service offerings to better reflect our business model.
our professional services engagement models vary based on the type of services provided to a customer, the mix and locations of delivery professionals involved and pricing type, which is either time-and-material or fixed-price. historically, the majority of our professional services revenues have been generated under time-and-material contracts and we expect time-and-material arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future.

cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, project-related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period. our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs.
we manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects. some of these professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $1,488.2 million, representing an increase of 25.4% from $1,186.9 million reported last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 19.2% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year and a higher level of accrued variable compensation in 2019 as compared to the prior year.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 64.9% and 64.4% during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the year-over-year increase reflects the impact from lower utilization rates and increased stock compensation expense.
discussion of cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business. these expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, severance, bad debt, travel, legal and accounting services, insurance, facilities including operating leases, advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus high-technologies park. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady as a percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations, strategic business acquisitions, and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses were $457.4 million, representing an increase of 22.4% as compared to $373.6 million reported last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily driven by a $44.8 million increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses, and a $28.0 million increase in facilities and infrastructure related expenses to support our growth.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4% to 19.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily driven by the slower growth of 19.7% in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation expense as compared to revenue growth of 24.5%.
discussion of selling, general and administrative expenses from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended december 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization expense was $45.3 million, representing an increase of $8.7 million from $36.6 million reported last year. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth. depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at 2.0% during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.
discussion of depreciation and amortization expense from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and employee housing loans, gains and losses from certain financial instruments, interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. there were no material changes in interest and other income, net in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017.
provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment. we consider factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future. these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items.
as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had $234.2 million, $205.2 million and $180.9 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest and penalty expense. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
in belarus, member technology companies of high-technologies park, including our local subsidiary, have a full exemption from belarus income tax on qualifying income through january 2049. however, beginning february 1, 2018, the earnings of the company's belarus local subsidiary became subject to u.s. income taxation due to the company's decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary. consequently, there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption during 2018 compared to the previous year. there was no aggregate dollar benefit derived from this tax holiday for the year ended december 31, 2019, and the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated $1.4 million and $15.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. there was no impact on diluted net income per share for the year ended december 31, 2019. the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated $0.02 and $0.28 for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the provision for income taxes was $38.5 million in 2019 and $9.5 million in 2018, partially driven by the increase in pre-tax income year over year. the effective tax rate increased from 3.8% in 2018 to 12.8% in 2019 primarily due to one-time benefits in 2018, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits associated with equity award exercises and vesting which were $28.4 million in 2019 compared to $17.4 million in 2018. the provision for income taxes in 2018 included the following one-time net tax benefits:
•   we recorded a $26.0 million benefit to reflect the establishment of net deferred tax assets as a result of our decision to file entity classification elections with the internal revenue service for the majority of our foreign subsidiaries to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for u.s. income tax purposes.
•   the provisional charge recorded in 2017 due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to u.s. income tax was reduced by $4.9 million, and the provisional charge recorded in 2017 due to the impact of the change in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% on the valuation of the net deferred tax assets was increased by $0.9 million.
•   based on proposed tax regulations issued by the u.s. department of the treasury during 2018, it was determined that a u.s. foreign tax credit could be claimed for the withholding tax paid to belarus resulting in a net $4.9 million tax benefit recognized in 2018.
discussion of the provision for income taxes from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
foreign exchange gain / loss for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign exchange risk."
results by business segment our operations consist of three reportable segments: north america, europe, and russia. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and segment operating profits. segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level. such expenses include certain types of professional fees, non-corporate taxes, compensation to non-employee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses, including compensation of specific groups of non-production employees. in addition, the company does not allocate stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related expenses. these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations.
we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market. as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some cases, managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam's senior management team. in such cases, the customer's activity would be reported through the management team's reportable segment.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company changed its management reporting of segment revenues to exclude other income. prior year amounts presented below have been changed to conform to that presentation.
segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the north america, europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company began to allocate certain staff recruitment and development expenses into segment operating profit as these expenses became part of the evaluation of segment management's performance. these costs were not previously allocated to segments and were included in unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated income before provision for income taxes. the effect of this reclassification was not material to segment operating profit and had no impact on total income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018.
north america segment
2019 compared to 2018
during 2019, north america segment revenues increased $304.0 million, or 28.2%, over last year. revenues from our north america segment represent 60.2% and 58.4% of total segment revenues during 2019 and 2018, respectively. during 2019 as compared to 2018, the north america segment's operating profits increased $71.9 million, or 32.4%, to $293.8 million. north america's operating profit represented 21.3% of north america segment revenues as compared to 20.6% in 2018.
revenues were negatively impacted by the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment from the north america segment as a result of a change in managerial responsibility. without this reassignment, north america segment revenue growth would have been 34.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.

the europe segment benefited from strong growth in the business information & media vertical of 116.5% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. this is primarily due to the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment from the north america segment as a result of a change in managerial responsibility. without this reassignment, business information & media growth would have been 22.7% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment, however, revenues in financial services decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to slower demand for our services by certain banks in europe. revenues in software & hi-tech also decreased during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of 2018 primarily due to a change in the estimate of variable consideration associated with a single customer.

the depreciation of the russian ruble against the u.s. dollar during 2019 as compared to 2018 unfavorably impacted revenues in this segment; however, segment operating profit as a percentage of revenues improved primarily due to realized gains on our foreign currency hedges. currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment. ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues and profitability in this segment. we continue to monitor geopolitical forces, economic and trade sanctions, and other issues involving this region.
2018 compared to 2017
revenues from our russia segment increased $10.2 million relative to 2017 and represent 4.0% and 4.3% of total segment revenues during 2018 and 2017, respectively. operating profits of our russia segment decreased $2.5 million when compared to 2017. expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues, the segment's operating profits were 15.6% and 22.1% in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

effects of inflation economies in some countries where we operate, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan, ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages. while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business. as of december 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $936.6 million and $274.7 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
we have cash in banks in belarus, russia, ukraine, kazakhstan, armenia and uzbekistan, where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability. banking and other financial systems in these countries generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured. as of december 31, 2019, the total amount of cash held in these countries was $206.5 million and of this amount, $123.4 million was located in belarus.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $274.7 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and had outstanding debt of $25.0 million. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future. see note 8 "long-term debt" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding our long-term debt.
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased $4.8 million, or 1.6%, to $287.5 million, as compared to 2018 primarily driven by the payout of a higher level of variable compensation related to 2018 performance, partially offset by the increase in net income. additionally, a larger improvement in days sales outstanding during 2018 compared to 2019 resulted in higher relative collections during 2018 as compared to 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2019 was $145.4 million compared to $112.1 million used in the same period in 2018. during 2019, the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of $61.7 million compared to the same period last year, partially offset by a decrease in net cash used to acquire businesses of $34.9 million.
financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $20.4 million, representing a $2.6 million decrease from $23.0 million cash provided by financing activities in 2018. the decrease was primarily driven by $7.8 million in higher payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by a $3.5 million repayment of debt in 2018 and $2.2 million of higher cash received in 2019 from the exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans compared to 2018.
discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2018 and 2017 is disclosed in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.

(1)   the u.s. tax act transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings is payable in annual installments through 2026. see note 6 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.
(2)   we estimate our future obligations for long-term incentive plan payouts by assuming the closing price per share of our common stock at december 31, 2019 remains constant into the future. this is an estimate as actual prices will vary over time.
(3)   our future obligations related to the 2017 credit facility consist of principal, interest and fees for the unused balance. we assume the floating interest rate in effect at december 31, 2019 will remain constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual rates will vary over time. in addition, for the 2017 credit facility, we assume that the balance outstanding and the unused balance as of december 31, 2019 remain the same through the remaining term of the agreement. the actual respective balances under our 2017 credit facility may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on the business decisions of management.
(4)   during the year ended december 31, 2019, we entered into agreements to purchase office space in ukraine intended to support the global delivery centers in that country. see note 14 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we also committed to purchasing certain software licenses.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. in addition, we had recorded $10.5 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2019 related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments.
see note 14 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for information regarding contractual obligations.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. however, our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 14 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

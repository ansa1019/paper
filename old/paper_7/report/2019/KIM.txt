item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10-k. historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements, including trends, should not be taken as indicative of future operations.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification. the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate.  the company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance.  accordingly, the company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate, including real estate under development, and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments and other investments, and realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments.
revenue recognition and recoverability of trade accounts receivable revenues from rental properties, net are comprised of minimum base rent, percentage rent, lease termination fee income, amortization of above-market and below-market rent adjustments and straight-line rent adjustments.  upon the adoption of asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842) ("asu 2016-02"), the company elected the lessor practical expedient to combine the lease and non-lease components, determined the lease component was the predominant component and as a result, accounted for the combined components under topic 842.  non-lease components include reimbursements paid to the company from tenants for common area maintenance costs, and other operating expenses. the combined components are included in revenues from rental properties, net on the company's consolidated statements of income.
base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. these percentage rents are recognized once the required sales level is achieved. rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. lease termination fee income is recognized when the lessee provides consideration in order to terminate an existing lease agreement and has vacated the leased space.  if the lessee continues to occupy the leased space for a period of time after the lease termination is agreed upon, the termination fee is accounted for as a lease modification based on the modified lease term.   upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of identified intangible assets and liabilities (including above-market and below-market leases, where applicable).  the capitalized above-market or below-market intangible asset or liability is amortized to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases, which includes the expected renewal option period for below-market leases.
also included in revenues from rental properties, net are ancillary income and tax increment financing ("tif") income.  ancillary income is derived through various agreements relating to parking lots, clothing bins, temporary storage, vending machines, atms, trash bins and trash collections, seasonal leases, etc.  the majority of the revenue derived from these sources is through lease agreements/arrangements and is recognized in accordance with the lease terms described in the lease.  the company has tif agreements with certain municipalities and receives payments in accordance with the agreements.  tif reimbursement income is recognized on a cash-basis when received.
trade accounts receivable the company reviews its trade accounts receivable, including its straight-line rent receivable, related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues for collectability. the company analyzes its accounts receivable, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the collectability of the lessee's total accounts receivable balance on a lease by lease basis. in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. effective january 1, 2019, in accordance with the adoption of topic 842 the company includes provision for doubtful accounts in revenues from rental properties, net. if a lessee's accounts receivable balance is considered uncollectible, the company will write-off the receivable balances associated with the lease and will only recognize lease income on a cash basis. if the company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect the remaining lessee's lease payments under the lease term, the company will then reinstate the straight-line balance and the lease income will then be limited to the lesser of (i) the straight-line rental income or (ii) the lease payments that have been collected from the lessee.
20
real estate depreciable lives the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
the company capitalizes acquisition costs related to real estate operating properties, which qualify as asset acquisitions. also, upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on a market approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements (in years)                                                 5 to 50

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements (including certain identified intangible assets)   terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
valuation of real estate, including real estate under development, and intangible assets and liabilities on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, general market conditions and delays of development, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows, net of anticipated construction and leasing costs (undiscounted and unleveraged), of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor, operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. the company's estimated fair values are primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third parties, discounted cash flow models or third party appraisals. estimated fair values that are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. if, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
valuation of joint venture investments and other investments the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, are based upon an allocation of the investment's net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.
the company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in open-air shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. these joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the company's exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and, due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt, which may be guaranteed by the joint venture. the company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments.
21
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period, capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
the company's estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums. capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions the company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trss and subject to local taxes on certain non-u.s. investments. the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted.
a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the evidence available, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the valuation allowance, which requires significant judgement from management, should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's judgement in determining a valuation allowance.
the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions, which requires significant judgment from management. although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company's income tax expense in the period in which a change is made, which could have a material impact on operating results (see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations. the convenience and availability of e-commerce has continued to impact the retail sector, which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases and/or lease available space. to mitigate the effect of e-commerce on its business, the company's strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers, including grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants, which offer buy online and pick up in store, off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items.
23
the company's investment strategy is to invest capital into high quality assets focusing on major metropolitan-area u.s. markets, predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sunbelt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry while disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations.  through this strategy, the company has transformed its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio.  the properties acquired are primarily located in major metropolitan areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic, resulting in higher sales volume.  the company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels, rental rates and rental growth.  in addition, the company, on a selective basis, has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixed-use components.
as part of the company's investment strategy, each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. in addition, the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate, such as, repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain properties. if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values, the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material.  for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see item 1a. "risk factors."

(5)   in accordance with the adoption of topic 842 the company, effective january 1, 2019, includes provision for doubtful accounts amounts in revenues from rental properties, net.

net income available to the company's common shareholders was $340.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to $439.6 million for the comparable period in 2018. on a diluted per share basis, net income available to the company's common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2019, was $0.80 as compared to $1.02 for the comparable period in 2018.  for additional disclosure, see footnote 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
the following describes the changes of certain line items included on the company's consolidated statements of income, that the company believes changed significantly and affected net income available to the company's common shareholders during the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period in 2018:
revenue from rental properties, net -
the decrease in revenues from rental properties, net of $7.3 million is primarily from (i) an aggregate decrease in revenues of $62.3 million due to properties sold during 2019 and 2018 and (ii) the inclusion of credit losses of $4.6 million during the year ended december 31,2019 (amounts for credit losses for 2018 are included in provision for doubtful accounts on the company's consolidated statements of income), partially offset by (iii) the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, which provided incremental revenues for year ended december 31, 2019 of $59.6 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
24
operating and maintenance -
the increase in operating and maintenance of $7.7 million is primarily from an increase in operating costs of $9.7 million related to the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects, partially offset by properties sold during 2019 and 2018.
general and administrative -
the increase in general and administrative expense of $9.1 million is primarily due to (i) a decrease in the capitalization of internal indirect leasing costs of $12.5 million, primarily due to the adoption of topic 842, which allows only the initial direct cost of a lease to be capitalized (see footnote 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by (ii) a reduction in salary and severance expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 of $2.4 million, primarily related to a reduction in personnel.
impairment charges -
during the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $48.7 million and $79.2 million, respectively, for which the company's estimated fair values were primarily based upon (i) signed contracts or letters of intent from third party offers or (ii) discounted cash flow models. these adjustments to property carrying values were recognized in connection with the company's efforts to market certain properties and management's assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions. certain of the calculations to determine fair value utilized unobservable inputs and, as such, were classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. for additional disclosure, see footnotes 6 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
depreciation and amortization -

the company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintain or obtain an upgrade on its investment-grade senior, unsecured debt ratings.  the company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional common and preferred equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives.
since the completion of the company's ipo in 1991, the company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. since the ipo, the company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $14.1 billion.  proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in open-air shopping centers, funding real estate under development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments.

dividends -
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as the board of directors monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio which reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate. cash dividends paid were $531.6 million, $529.8 million and $506.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.

hurricane impact -
during september 2017, hurricane maria struck puerto rico and caused various amounts of damage to the company's seven operating properties located throughout the island. the company expects to collect property insurance proceeds (net of a deductible of $1.2 million) equal to the replacement cost of its damaged property estimated to be approximately $30.3 million.  as of december 31, 2019, the company has collected property insurance proceeds totaling $24.2 million to date, which exceeds the $16.0 million of net book value of the damaged property that was previously written off by $8.2 million.  the company recognized this excess as income in the periods that insurance proceeds were received. as such, the company recognized $4.0 million and $4.2 million as income which is included in other income, net on the company's consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

the company has $159.5 million of secured debt scheduled to mature in 2020. subsequent to december 31, 2019, the company repaid $66.6 million of this secured debt.  the company anticipates satisfying the remaining future maturities with a combination of operating cash flows and its credit facility.
the company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for loans encumbering certain of the company's development and redevelopment projects and guarantee of payment related to the company's insurance program. as of december 31, 2019, these letters of credit aggregated $40.8 million.
in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2019, the company had $17.6 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
the company has accrued $2.4 million of non-current uncertain tax positions and related interest under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for income taxes, which are included in other liabilities on the company's consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2019. these amounts are not included in the table above because a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with the relevant tax authorities, if any, cannot be made.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties. such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors and individuals. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. as of december 31, 2019, the company did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k). the table below presents debt balances within the company's unconsolidated joint venture investments for which the company held noncontrolling ownership interests at december 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):

* average remaining term includes extensions
(1)   includes an unsecured term loan of $200.0 million (excluding deferred financing costs of $0.2 million), which is scheduled to mature in august 2020, with a one-year extension option at the joint venture's discretion, and bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.50% (3.26% at december 31, 2019).

(2)   includes an unsecured revolving credit facility which had no outstanding balance at december 31, 2019, which is scheduled to mature in september 2020, with two one-year extension options at the joint venture's discretion, and bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.75% (3.51% at december 31, 2019).

32
as of december 31, 2019, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from two months to 12 years and bore interest at rates ranging from 2.91% to 6.55%. approximately $146.3 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balances matures in 2020. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing, unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from sales and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other real estate investments the company previously provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties through its preferred equity program. as of december 31, 2019, the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $175.3 million relating to 240 properties, including 230 net leased properties. as of december 31, 2019, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $226.8 million (excluding fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $9.3 million). these loans have scheduled maturities ranging from seven months to five years and bear interest at rates ranging from 4.19% to 10.47%. due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. in december 2018, the nareit issued "nareit funds from operations white paper - 2018 restatement" (the "ffo 2018 restatement") which clarifies, where necessary, existing guidance and consolidates alerts and policy bulletins into a single document for ease of use.  nareit defines ffo as net income/(loss) available to the company's common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. included in the ffo 2018 restatement is an option for the company to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business in the calculation of ffo. the main business of a reit is acquiring, owning, operating, developing and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with its rental of real estate.  incidental assets may include, but are not limited to, land peripheral to operating properties, property developed for sale, and securities. the ffo 2018 restatement is effective for annual periods beginning after december 31, 2018 and interim periods reported within those periods.
as a result of adopting the ffo 2018 restatement, the company has elected to exclude gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and to exclude mark-to-market changes in value of its equity securities in calculating ffo. as such, the company will no longer include gains/impairments on land parcels, gains/losses (realized or unrealized) from marketable securities or gains/impairments on preferred equity participations in nareit defined ffo.
the company presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo available to the company's common shareholders when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
the company also presents ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure, as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo available to the company's common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments, which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company's operating real estate portfolio.
ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.  our method of calculating ffo available to the company's common shareholders and ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

the company's reconciliation of net income available to the company's common shareholders to ffo available to the company's common shareholders and ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted, is reflected in the table below (in thousands, except per share data). in conjunction with the adoption of the ffo 2018 restatement, the company has reclassified $3.4 million from transactional expense and $10.9 million from transactional income into ffo available to the company's common shareholders for the three months and year ended december 31, 2018, respectively, relating to incidental gains and losses on the sale of assets and mark-to-market changes in equity securities. this reclassification had no impact on ffo available to the company's common shareholders as adjusted for the three months and year ended december 31, 2018.

(2)   reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period, which would have a dilutive effect on ffo available to the company's common shareholders. ffo available to the company's common shareholders would be increased by $199 and $228 for the three months ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $868 and $916 for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the effect of other certain convertible units would have an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of net income available to the company's common shareholders per share. accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.

same property net operating income ("same property noi")
same property noi is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. it excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.
same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, tifs and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for bad debt, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company's proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. the company's method of calculating same property noi available to the company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

same property noi increased by $24.4 million, or 3.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period in 2018. this increase is primarily the result of (i) an increase of $25.1 million related to lease-up and rent commencements in the portfolio, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in other property income of $0.7 million.
effects of inflation many of the company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. most of the company's leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

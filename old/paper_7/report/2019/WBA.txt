introduction and segments walgreens boots alliance, inc. ("walgreens boots alliance") and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:
•   retail pharmacy usa;
•   retail pharmacy international; and
•   pharmaceutical wholesale see note 16, segment reporting and note 17, sales further information.
factors affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. these factors include: financial performance of our equity method investees, including amerisourcebergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from rite aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the u.s. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the united states and china, and international relations, including the uk's proposed withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined below); fluctuations in variable costs; and general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates. these and other factors can affect the company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
transformational cost management program on december 20, 2018, the company announced a transformational cost management program that is expected to deliver in excess of $1.5 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the "transformational cost management program"). as of the date of this report, the company now expects to deliver in excess of $1.8 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. the transformational cost management program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company's information technology (it) capabilities, is designed to help the company achieve increased cost efficiencies. to date, the company has taken initial actions across all aspects of the transformational cost management program. the actions under the transformational cost management program focus on all reportable segments and the company's global functions. divisional optimization within each of the company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores which includes plans to close approximately 200 stores in the united kingdom and approximately 200 locations in the united states.
the company currently estimates that the transformational cost management program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. the company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the transformational cost management program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to lease and other real estate payments, employee severance and technology costs related to the company's it transformation.
the company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results related to transformational cost management program as follows:

1 primarily related to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs.
in addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the transformational cost management program, the company expects to record $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (topic 842) that became effective on september 1, 2019. see note 1, summary of major accounting policies, for additional information.
since the approval of the transformational cost management program, the company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with gaap of $477 million, of which $432 million are recorded as exit and disposal activities. see note 3, exit and disposal activities, for additional information.

transformational cost management program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with gaap. the company treats charges related to the transformational cost management program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
acquisition of certain rite aid assets on september 19, 2017, the company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. the company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 rite aid stores and the first distribution center and related inventory, while the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.
the company expects to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, at an estimated total cost of approximately $850 million, which is reported as acquisition-related costs. the company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges for the fiscal year 2019 and 2018 of $295 million and $221 million, respectively, related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. in addition, the company expects to spend approximately $500 million on store conversions and related activities. the company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million,

which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
store optimization program on october 24, 2017, the company's board of directors approved a plan to implement a program (the "store optimization program") to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the company's retail pharmacy usa segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from rite aid. as of the date of this report, the company expects to close approximately 750 stores, of which the majority have been closed as part of this program. the actions under the store optimization program commenced in march 2018 and are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2020. the store optimization program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $350 million per year to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020.
the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $350 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs and employee severance and other exit costs. the company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $190 million for employee severance and other exit costs. the company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures.
since approval of the store optimization program, the company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of $296 million, including $100 million for fiscal 2018 and $196 million for fiscal 2019, which were primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. cumulative pre-tax charges included $138 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $158 million in employee severance and other exit costs.

u.s. tax law changes in connection with the u.s. tax law changes enacted in december 2017 and in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin 118, the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the u.s. tax law changes during the three months ended february 28, 2019. the incremental net tax benefit recorded upon completion of the analysis of the income tax effects of the u.s. tax law changes was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
while the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the u.s. tax law changes, the final impact of the u.s. tax law changes may differ from this analysis, due to, among other things, technical clarifications from the u.s. department of the treasury and the internal revenue service ("irs"), interpretations of the u.s. tax law changes and actions the company may take. the company will continue to evaluate the impact of any future authoritative guidance with respect to the u.s. tax law changes.
during 2019, the u.s. treasury department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the 2017 u.s. tax law changes. certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the company's interpretation that led to the recognition of $247 million of tax benefits in prior periods. despite this new guidance, the company remains confident in its interpretation of the u.s. tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. however, if the company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded.
as the company repatriates the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the united states, the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to u.s. federal tax. the company continuously evaluates the amount of foreign earnings that are not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
investment in amerisourcebergen
- 37 -
as of august 31, 2019, the company owned 56,854,867 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock (representing approximately 27% of its outstanding common stock) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market.
the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company's pharmaceutical wholesale segment. the financial performance of amerisourcebergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the company's results of operations. additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations.
for more information, see "business - relationship with amerisourcebergen" and note 5, equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements.
the impact of brexit in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) is commonly referred to as "brexit". since the brexit vote in june 2016, there has been significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the united kingdom. in march 2017, the united kingdom formally started the process to leave the european union. an original exit date was set for march 29, 2019 but following the uk parliament's rejection of a negotiated outcome, the leaders of the member countries of the european union have agreed to multiple extensions of the deadline for brexit and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. although we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business, if the uk's membership in the european union terminates without an agreement, these conditions could continue and there could be increased costs from tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union and disruptions to the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the united kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on our business, particularly european operations; however, brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or operating results. for more information relating to this topic, see "risk factors-our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks."

walgreens boots alliance results of operations the following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. for discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2018 form 10-k, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on october 11, 2018.
fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
fiscal 2019 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 20.7 percent to $4.0 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 14.6 percent to $4.31 compared with the prior year. the decrease primarily reflects operating performance, including costs related to the company's transformational cost management program, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals in the prior year. diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. net earnings and diluted earnings per share were negatively by 0.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.
other income for fiscal 2019 was $233 million compared to $302 million for fiscal 2018. other income for fiscal 2019 primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to rite aid to become a member of the company's group purchasing organization. results for fiscal 2018 primarily reflect the gain on sale of the company's equity interest in premise health holding corp, partially offset by the impairment of the company's equity method investment in guangzhou pharmaceuticals corporation in the prior year period.
interest was a net expense of $704 million and $616 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 13.0% and 16.7%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the reduced u.s. statutory tax rate as a result of the u.s tax law changes.

decrease in certain circumstances. subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
- 52 -
the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to approximately 269% as of june 1, 2019 valuation date. the fair value of the boots reporting unit, in the retail pharmacy international division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9%. as at august 31, 2019, the carrying value of the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is $2.6 billion.
the company continues to closely monitor industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the boots reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangibles as the challenging market conditions in the uk continued to impact the operating performance of the boots reporting unit during the three months ended august 31, 2019.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. the fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying value amounts ranging from approximately 3% to approximately 29%, except for the pharmacy licenses. as at august 31, 2019, the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit is $6.9 billion. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, the company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit, which was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings.
see note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.
cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
in determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $368.1 million to the company's pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company's pension expense by $19.1 million.
- 53 -
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.
income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining its provision for income taxes, the company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

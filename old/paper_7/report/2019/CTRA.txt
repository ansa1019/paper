item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annul report on form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 are as follows:
•   natural gas production increased 135.4 bcf, or 19 percent, from 729.9 bcf in 2018 to 865.3 bcf in 2019, as a result of drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale.
•   equivalent production increased 130.3 bcfe, or 18 percent, from 735.0 bcfe, or 2,013.7 mmcfe per day, in 2018 to 865.3 bcfe, or 2,370.9 mmcfe per day, in 2019. the increase is primarily due to drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale, partially offset by the sale of our eagle ford shale assets in south texas in february 2018.
•   average realized natural gas price for 2019 was $2.45 per mcf, 4 percent lower than the $2.54 per mcf price realized in 2018.
•   total capital expenditures were $783.3 million in 2019 compared to $816.1 million in 2018.
•   drilled gross wells (94.0 net) with a success rate of 100.0 percent in 2019 compared to gross wells (95.1 net) with a success rate of 90.7 percent in 2018.
•   completed 99 gross wells (97.0 net) in 2019 compared to 94 gross wells (93.0 net) in 2018.
•   average rig count during 2019 was approximately 3.1 rigs in the marcellus shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 3.5 rigs and approximately 0.5 rigs in other areas during 2018.
•   repurchased 25.5 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $488.5 million in 2019 compared to 38.5 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $904.1 million in 2018.
•   received proceeds of $249.5 million, including restricted cash of $13.6 million, related to the sale of our equity investment in meade in november 2019.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. in addition, our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. we expect commodity prices to remain volatile. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to "results of operations" below. refer to "risk factors-commodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. we believe that we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in a volatile commodity pricing environment by:
•   continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program with the expectation of funding our capital expenditures with cash on hand, operating cash flows, and if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
•   continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production.
•   continuing to manage our balance sheet, which we believe provides sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
•   continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our production.
while we are unable to predict future commodity prices, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2019 were from the sale of natural gas production and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in meade. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures, interest payments on debt, repurchases of shares of our common stock, payment of dividends and contributions to our equity method investments. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
on april 22, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (revolving credit facility). the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties. the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our unused commitments remained at $1.5 billion.
a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility. unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. we believe that, with internally generated operating cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
at december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes. refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding restrictive covenants.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                                        2019   2018                      2017
cash flows provided by operating activities                                $1,445,791                $1,104,903                $898,160
cash flows used in investing activities                                      (543,915    )             (293,383    )           (706,153    )
cash flows used in financing activities                                      (690,380    )           (1,289,280    )           (210,502    )
net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash        $211,496                 $(477,760    )           $(18,495    )
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices, changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. commodity prices have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil, pipeline infrastructure constraints, basis differentials, inventory storage levels and seasonal influences. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, repayments of debt, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, payment of dividends, repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a working capital surplus of $240.2 million and $257.3 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 increased by $340.9 million compared to 2018. this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received in settlement of derivatives, higher natural gas revenue, lower operating expenses and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in brokered natural gas revenue. the increase in natural gas revenue was due to higher equivalent production, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas prices. average realized natural gas prices decreased by 4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. equivalent production increased by 18 percent for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale.
refer to "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities increased by $250.5 million from 2018 compared to 2019. the increase was due to $675.8 million lower proceeds from the sale of assets primarily due to the divestiture of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018 and our haynesville shale assets in july 2018. this change was partially offset by $249.5 million of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in meade in november 2019, $106.1 million of lower capital expenditures and $67.9 million of lower capital contributions associated with our equity method investments.
financing activities. cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $598.9 million from 2018 compared to 2019. the decrease was due to $352.9 million of lower repurchases of our common stock in 2019 and $290.0 million of lower net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes in 2018. this decrease was partially offset by $34.1 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2019, $7.4 million higher debt issuance costs related to amending our revolving credit facility in early 2019 and $2.4 million higher tax withholdings on vesting of stock awards. share repurchases in 2019 include $31.4 million of share repurchases that were accrued in 2018 and paid in 2019.
2018 and 2017 compared. for additional information on the comparison of operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, refer to financial condition (cash flows) included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31, 2019 was $72.1 million. refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves, are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as commodity prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves estimate has been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.02 per mcfe and an increase of $0.02 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. this estimated impact is based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
derivative instruments under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models. such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward commodity prices, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, management's judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
other issues and contingencies regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. refer to the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks. refer to "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices. further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results.
the majority of our production is sold at market prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives, including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2019 and 2018 compared we reported net income for 2019 of $681.1 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to net income for 2018 of $557.0 million, or $1.25 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and interest expense and higher earnings on equity method investments. these increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher income tax expense.
revenue, price and volume variance our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes. below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $104.1 million was due to higher production partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in production was a result of an increase in our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale.
crude oil and condensate revenues the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $48.7 million was primarily due to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $211.6 million from 2018 to 2019. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $7.3 million primarily driven by $18.7 million of higher operating costs due to higher production, which included a $10.1 million increase in workover expense. this increase was partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in operating costs as a result of the sale of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018.
•   transportation and gathering increased $77.9 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production, partially offset by a decrease in demand charges related to a change in commitments.
•   brokered natural gas decreased $184.2 million. there was no brokered natural gas activity in the current period.
•   taxes other than income decreased $5.6 million due to $3.6 million lower production taxes resulting from the sale of the eagle ford shale assets in february of 2018 and $2.7 million lower drilling impact fees driven by a decrease in rates associated with lower natural gas prices.
•   exploration decreased $93.6 million as a result of a decrease in exploratory dry hole costs of $95.5 million compared to 2018. the exploratory dry hole costs in 2018 related to our exploration activities in west texas and ohio. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million in geological and geophysical costs.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $11.7 million primarily due to lower amortization of unproved properties of $49.7 million, partially offset by higher dd&amp;a of $37.1 million. amortization of unproved properties decreased due to lower amortization rates as a result of a decrease in exploration activities. the increase in dd&amp;a was primarily due to an increase of $58.0 million due to higher equivalent production volumes in the marcellus shale, partially offset by a decrease of $21.0 million related to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $0.42 per mcfe for 2019 compared to $0.45 per mcfe for 2018. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to positive reserve revisions to our 2018 year-end reserve estimates and lower cost reserve additions.
•   general and administrative decreased $1.8 million primarily due to a $6.1 million decrease in professional services and a $2.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense associated with certain of our market-based performance awards. these decreases were partially offset by $2.1 million in severance cost incurred in the second quarter 2019 and $3.0 million in higher employee costs. the remaining changes in other general and administrative expenses were not individually significant.
earnings on equity method investments earnings on equity method investments increased $79.4 million primarily due to the sale of our investment in meade for a gain of $75.8 million and the recognition of our proportionate share of net income from our equity method investments in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily from our investment in meade, which commenced operations in late 2018.
loss on sale of assets during 2019, we recognized a net aggregate loss of $1.5 million primarily due to the conveyance of certain remaining properties related to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets. during 2018, we recognized a net aggregate loss of $16.3 million primarily due to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets, partially offset by a gain on the sale of oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale.
interest expense, net interest expense decreased $18.2 million primarily due to $14.1 million lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of $237.0 million of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes, which matured in july 2018 and $67.0 million of our 9.78% senior notes that matured in december 2018 and a $6.2 million decrease related to income tax reserves. these decreases were partially offset by $3.6 million of lower interest income.
income tax expense income tax expense increased $78.1 million due to higher pretax income and a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 24.3 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of non-recurring discrete items recorded during 2019 compared to 2018.
excluding the impact of any discrete items, we expect our 2020 effective income tax rate to be approximately 23.0 percent. however, this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in enacted federal and/or state rates that occur during the year, changes in our executive compensation and the amount of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base, our employees and our customers.
2018 and 2017 compared we reported net income for 2018 of $557.0 million, or $1.25 per share, compared to net income for 2017 of $100.4 million, or $0.22 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating revenues, lower operating expenses and higher earnings on equity method investments, partially offset by higher income tax expense.
for additional information on the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, refer to management's discussion and analysis included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
non-gaap financial measures explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap). however, we believe certain non-gaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods. in addition, we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. the reconciliations of gaap financial measures to non-gaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10-k are shown below.
reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income adjusted net income is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure enables a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. adjusted net income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets, gain and loss on derivative instruments, gain on sale of equity method investments, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, interest expense related to income tax reserves and tax effect on selected items. additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as defined by gaap.

discretionary cash flow and free cash flow calculation and reconciliation discretionary cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities. discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. discretionary cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.
free cash flow is defined as discretionary cash flow (defined above) less capital expenditures and investment in equity method investments. free cash flow is an indicator of a company's ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. free cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies. free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.

finding and development costs drill-bit finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions. all-sources finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions and revision of prior estimates. drill-bit finding and development cost and all-sources finding and development cost are presented based on management's belief that these non-gaap measures are useful information to investors to evaluate how much it costs to add proved reserves. these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves and may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.

introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including "item 1 - business;" "item 6 - selected financial data;" and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data."
we begin our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products.  this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  we then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the changes in our fiscal 2019 results of operations compared to fiscal 2018 were primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi corporation, which closed on may 29, 2018. after discussing our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled "liquidity and capital resources," "contractual obligations" and "off-balance sheet arrangements". our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. for our discussion of our fiscal 2019 results in comparison to fiscal 2018 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections, refer to "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2019 filed with the sec on may 30, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein.
covid-19 developments the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a global reduction in economic activity by adversely affecting production, creating supply chain and market disruption, and adversely impacting businesses and individuals. the severity and duration of the economic impact is currently unknown and will depend on many factors, such as the effectiveness of containment efforts. we regularly monitor new information regarding the severity of the covid-19 virus and the ability to contain, treat, or prevent it.
demand for our products has increased in the areas of our business that support the stay-at-home economy, such as products used in medical devices, datacenter, communications infrastructure, computers, printers, monitors and contact free consumer and industrial products. however, demand has decreased in other areas such as automotive, broad based industrial, consumer and home appliances, and aerospace. we have seen a greater number of order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates. some customers are requesting order cancellation within our firm order window and are claiming applicability of force majeure clauses. while we have a diverse customer base operating in diverse industries, the extent of the impact of the covid-19 virus on demand for our products depends on unpredictable future developments.
at this time, our global manufacturing sites are operational, though certain of them are operating at reduced utilization levels. this may be due to local restrictions related to the covid-19 virus, such as our philippine manufacturing sites, or a decrease in demand for products manufactured at a particular site. additionally, travel restrictions have impacted our subcontractors' manufacturing operations in malaysia and china, and similar challenges have arisen for our logistics service providers, which has impacted their ability to ship product to our customers. the impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in the fiscal quarter ended march 31, 2020 but we have seen increased impacts since then which we expect to adversely impact our business in the fiscal quarter ended june 30, 2020 and which could continue to adversely impact our business in future periods. in the future, local governments could require us to temporarily reduce production further or cease operations at any of our facilities and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders.
in response to the early indications of the covid-19 pandemic, we took proactive measures to safeguard the health of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, visitors to our facilities, other business partners, and our communities. we strategically implemented plans intended to ensure business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations. we are committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, visitors to our facilities, other business partners, and communities. we are following governmental policies and cdc recommendations designed to slow the spread of the covid-19 virus.
our efforts to combat the covid-19 virus include the following:
•   we require social distancing, and have established distancing protocols at our facilities. we currently prohibit visitors, have suspended business travel, have suspended attendance at conferences and other gatherings, and require team members to work from home to the extent possible. where work from home is not possible, all on-site team members are requested to take their temperatures before arriving to work, stay home if they do not feel well, stay home if they have been exposed to someone with the covid-19 virus or its symptoms, maintain a safe distance from others, wash their hands frequently, and wear a mask if they choose. we clean high touch surfaces daily.
•   in partnership with our suppliers, we have evaluated our supply chain to identify gaps or weak points. in order to ensure continuity, in some cases, we have qualified alternative suppliers and increased our inventory of raw materials.
•   we have added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of subcontractors.
•   we have implemented measures to help prepare for an economic downturn, such as implementing employee salary cuts, limiting hiring, reducing business travel costs, reducing discretionary spending, and limiting capital expenditures.
•   we are working with government authorities in the areas where we have a significant footprint. we continue to update ourselves on government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members across the globe.
we believe these actions are important and will help preserve the health of our team members, customers, suppliers, visitors to our facilities, people with whom we conduct business and our communities, and allow us to safely continue operations. however, we cannot predict how these actions, or the actions taken by government entities, suppliers, or customers in response to the covid-19 virus outbreak will impact our business, revenues, or results of operations.
acquisition of microsemi on may 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of microsemi corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in aliso viejo, california. we paid an aggregate of approximately $8.19 billion in cash to the stockholders of microsemi. the total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $53.9 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of microsemi for stock awards of microchip, was approximately $8.24 billion. in addition to the consideration transferred, we recognized in our consolidated financial statements $3.23 billion in liabilities of microsemi consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities of which $2.06 billion of existing debt was paid off. we financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion of loans under our revolving line of credit (the "revolving credit facility"), $3.00 billion of term loans ("term loan facility") provided under our amended and restated credit agreement, and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes. we incurred $22.0 million in costs related to the acquisition. as a result of the acquisition, microsemi became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip. microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense, communications, data center and industrial markets. our primary reason for this acquisition was to expand our range of solutions, products and capabilities by extending our served available market.
for further details, see the discussion in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
strategy our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications.  our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions, including general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, microprocessors, field-programmable gate array (fpga) products, a broad spectrum of high-performance linear, mixed-signal, power management, thermal management, discrete diodes and mosfets, radio frequency (rf), timing, timing systems, safety, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity devices, as well as serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory (eeprom), serial flash memories, parallel flash memories, serial electrically erasable random access memory (eeram) and serial static random access memory (sram). we also license flash-ip solutions that are incorporated in a broad range of products.  we provide highly cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed signal integration and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products.  we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products, gate array, rf and analog products that require embedded non-volatile memory.
we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries. the principal markets that we serve include consumer, automotive, industrial, aerospace, office communication, and computing.  our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets.
our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe and assembly and test.  the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  by owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields.  direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin. we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties.  our acquisition of microsemi significantly increased the amount of our outsourced manufacturing requirements.
we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products.  we believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs.  while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products.  this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly.  our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.
we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, fpgas, timing systems, flash-ip, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries.  we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products.
we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors.  our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the americas, europe and asia.  we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america, europe and asia.  we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.  many of our client engagement managers (cems), embedded solutions engineers (eses), and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment.  we believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams.  eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world or through online webcasts, and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.
see "our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry," on page 17 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.  we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, share-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and contingencies.  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.  we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition on april 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606) and all related amendments. we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and non-distributor customers (direct customers) and, to a lesser extent, from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property. we apply the following five-step approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.
sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement, a purchase order, and an order acknowledgment. sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract, as defined by asc 606, until the distributor has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order, we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created; this generally occurs 30 days prior to the estimated ship date. as is customary in the semiconductor industry, we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors. as these are forms of variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method. usually, there is only a single performance obligation in the contract, and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. after the transaction price has been allocated, we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor.
sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment. sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract, as defined by asc 606, until shipment of the product occurs. generally, the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable. usually, there is only a single performance obligation in the contract, and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. after the transaction price has been allocated, we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer.
revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements. our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property. the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty, which is fixed in the licensing agreement. revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs.
business combinations all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting.  under the acquisition method of accounting, (i) acquisition-related costs, except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities, will be expensed in the period incurred; (ii) non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; (iii) in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility; (iv) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and (v) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense.  the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment.  the valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach.  the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates:  revenue, expenses, capital spending and other costs, and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows.  under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. on an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31, 2020, we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance.
share-based compensation we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values.  we utilize rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees.  share-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. total share-based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal 2020 was $170.2 million, of which $149.3 million was reflected in operating expenses and $20.9 million was reflected in cost of sales. total share-based compensation included in our inventory balance was $14.4 million at march 31, 2020.
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense.  future share-based compensation expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable. in estimating our inventory obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12-month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month demand. estimates for projected 12-month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior three-month period, which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business. the estimated 12-month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12-month demand estimate. management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations. for example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand. alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued.
in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity, the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales. as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities, approximately $47.2 million and $16.2 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.  we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets, where it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of such assets, will not be realized.
various taxing authorities in the u.s. and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses.  companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. at this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. if this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. if the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
the accounting model as defined in accounting standards codification topic 740, income taxes (asc 740) related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions.  the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue.  we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period.  all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement.  generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires.  due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.
senior and junior subordinated convertible debt we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate.  this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.  lastly, we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met.  we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash.  this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future.
contingencies in the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims, governmental investigations and other matters.  additionally, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant.  consequently, we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions.  we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs.  with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  litigation, governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and we are, from time to time, subject to such litigation, governmental investigations and disputes.  as a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation, governmental investigations or disputes in the future.
we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. as of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable, which generally is based on a probability weighted model. if fair value is not determinable, contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable.

net sales we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies.  we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers, referred to as oems, in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral.  in certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit.
the following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 (dollars in millions):

2020                           2019                         % change net sales      $5,274.2                $5,349.5             (1.4   )%
the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve, which were negatively impacted by general economic conditions, trade restrictions, adverse changes in tariffs, and the impact of the covid-19 virus. these adverse conditions did not affect each of the markets we serve equally. for instance, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, we experienced relatively weaker demand for our products that are used in the consumer, automotive, and industrial markets, and relatively stronger demand for our products that are used in the computing, communication, and aerospace and defense markets. these adverse conditions negatively affected consolidated net sales by approximately 5% in fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 and such impact was partially offset by the timing of our acquisition of microsemi as fiscal 2020 included twelve months of microsemi net sales compared to ten months of microsemi net sales in fiscal 2019. the timing of our acquisition of microsemi accounted for an increase of approximately 4% in our net sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change. the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period. the overall average selling price of our products did not change significantly during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
key factors impacting the amount of net sales during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include:
•   global economic conditions in the markets we serve;
•   semiconductor industry conditions;
•   trade restrictions and adverse changes in tariffs;
•   our acquisition of microsemi, which closed on may 29, 2018;
•   our new product offerings that have increased our served available market;
•   customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions;
•   inventory holding patterns of our customers, including distributors; and
•   increasing semiconductor content in our customers' products.
net sales by product line for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):

total net sales                                          $5,274.2         100.0   %          $5,349.5         100.0   %
microcontrollers our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.  microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 53.4% and 54.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately 3.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the decrease in net sales was due primarily to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve, partially offset by our acquisition of microsemi.
historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.  the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products.  we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. we have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.  we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results. the average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period.
analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 28.7% and 28.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
net sales of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products decreased approximately 1.3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the decrease in net sales was due primarily to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve, partially offset by our acquisition of microsemi.
analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in nature.  currently, we consider a majority of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products.  the non-proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products.  we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results.  we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products will increase over time.
field-programmable gate array (fpga) products our fpga product line was primarily acquired as part of our acquisition of microsemi on may 29, 2018. sales of our fpga products accounted for approximately 7.1% and 5.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
net sales of our fpga products increased approximately 22.9% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the increase in net sales was due primarily to our acquisition of microsemi.
fpga product pricing has historically been relatively stable because they are proprietary products with significant design in complexity and are frequently designed into long-lived end applications.
licensing, memory and other licensing, memory and other (lmo) includes royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and products for aerospace applications. revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 10.8% and 11.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
net sales related to these services and products decreased approximately 3.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. lmo net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our licenses, engineering services, memory products, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).
distribution distributors accounted for approximately 50% and 51% our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. with the exception of arrow electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.
generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice.  the loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.
at march 31, 2020, our distributors maintained 29 days of inventory of our products compared to 35 days at march 31, 2019. over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days.
sales by geography sales by geography for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):

total net sales      $5,274.2            100.0%          $5,349.5            100.0%
americas sales include sales to customers in the u.s., canada, central america and south america. sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 78% and 80% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. substantially all of our foreign sales are u.s. dollar denominated. sales to customers in asia as a percentage of total sales have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market. sales to customers in the americas increased as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to our acquisition of microsemi, which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the americas. our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia.
gross profit our gross profit was $3.24 billion and $2.93 billion in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. gross profit as a percentage of sales was 61.5% and 54.8% in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were:
•   charges of approximately $365.7 million in fiscal 2019 related to the recognition of acquired inventory at fair value as a result of our acquisitions which increased the value of our acquired inventory and subsequently increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins when the related revenue was recognized;
•   for fiscal 2020 and 2019, inventory write-downs being higher than the gross margin impact of sales of inventory that was previously written down;
•   unabsorbed capacity charges due to operating at below normal capacity in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019; and
•   fluctuations in the product mix of our net sales.
other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include:
•   continual cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing, such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques; and
•   economic market conditions.
we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industry-related conditions.  when production levels are below normal capacity, which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment, we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity. during fiscal 2020, we operated at below normal capacity levels due to lower demand for our products primarily related to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid-19 virus resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $47.2 million compared to unabsorbed capacity charges of $16.2 million in fiscal 2019.
the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins.  our wafer fabrication facility located in tempe, arizona (fab 2) currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes our 0.5 micron to 1.0 micron processes.  our wafer fabrication facility located in gresham, oregon (fab 4) predominantly utilizes our 0.13 micron to 0.5 micron processes.  we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  all of our production in fab 2 and fab 4 has been on 8-inch wafers during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90% to 95%. our wafer fabrication facility in colorado springs, colorado (fab 5) currently utilizes processes between 0.25 micron and 1.0 micron that run on 6-inch wafers. we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70% to 75%.
our overall inventory levels were $685.7 million at march 31, 2020, compared to $711.7 million at march 31, 2019. we maintained 122 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31, 2020 compared to 128 days of inventory at march 31, 2019. we expect our days of inventory levels in the june 2020 quarter to be down 6 days to up 8 days compared to the march 2020 levels. we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers.
we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products, fpga products, memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve.
during fiscal 2020, we announced our intention to re-purpose fab 5 to manufacture discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products. in connection with these efforts, we reduced the clean room footprint and transferred certain higher volume products from fab 5 to our 8-inch wafer fabrication facilities in arizona and oregon. we anticipate that these actions will result in significant cost savings over the next several years. in fiscal 2020, we incurred $18.0 million in costs associated with these actions, which have been recorded within the special charges and other, net line item in our statements of income. we expect to incur less than $10.0 million within the next year for the remaining associated costs of these restructuring activities.
we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand, the philippines, and other locations throughout the world. during fiscal 2020, approximately 45% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities, compared to approximately 38% during fiscal 2019.  during fiscal 2020, approximately 54% of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities, compared to approximately 49% during fiscal 2019.  the increases in the percentage of assembly and test operations that were performed internally in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 are primarily due to our investments in assembly and test equipment, which increased our internal capacity capabilities, and also due to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve, which reduced our demand for external assembly and test operations. third-party contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations. the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our
46
internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.
we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. during fiscal 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 57% during fiscal 2019. the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi, for which the majority of its wafer fabrication requirements are outsourced. the timing of the acquisition, which occurred on may 29, 2018, also contributed to the increase as fiscal 2020 included twelve months of microsemi activity compared to ten months in fiscal 2019.
our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract.  while we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of our third-party contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses for fiscal 2020 were $877.8 million, or 16.6% of net sales, compared to $826.3 million, or 15.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2019. we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  r&d costs are expensed as incurred.  assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives.  r&d expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.
r&d expenses increased $51.5 million, or 6.2%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the primary reason for the increase in r&d expenses in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was additional costs from our acquisition of microsemi.
r&d expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 were $676.6 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $682.9 million, or 12.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2019.  our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses.  selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force, cems and eses who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.3 million, or 0.9%, for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the primary reasons for the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses were reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our microsemi acquisition, partially offset by remediation costs related to the network compromise discussed in item 9a of this form 10-k.
selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020 was $993.9 million compared to $674.1 million in fiscal 2019. the primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization was our acquisition of microsemi.
special charges and other, net during fiscal 2020, we incurred special charges and other, net of $46.7 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of $31.0 million and legal contingencies of $15.7 million. during fiscal 2019, we incurred special charges and other, net of $33.7 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of $63.9 million, offset by the release of $30.2 million in legal contingencies. restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2020 include $18.0 million related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations. other restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were related to our most recent business acquisitions, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations.
other income (expense)
interest income in fiscal 2020 was $2.8 million compared to $8.1 million in fiscal 2019. the primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was lower invested cash balances as we used a significant portion of our cash to help finance the purchase price of our acquisition of microsemi and we have continued to pay down our debt.
interest expense in fiscal 2020 was $497.3 million compared to $502.9 million in fiscal 2019. the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 relates to the cumulative pay down of debt.
loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2020 was $5.4 million compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2019. in fiscal 2020, we recognized losses of $2.0 million primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility and $3.4 million related to the settlement of $615.0 million in principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt. in fiscal 2019, the losses primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility.
other income, net, in fiscal 2020 was $3.2 million compared to other loss, net of $2.2 million in fiscal 2019. the primary reason for the change in other income during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
provision for income taxes we account for incomes taxes in accordance with asc 740. our provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to u.s. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. a comparison of our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2020 and march 31, 2019 is not meaningful due to the amount of pre-tax income, and income tax benefits recorded during the period.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a $40.8 million tax benefit received from current year generated r&d credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 27.2%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a $11.1 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 7.4%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a $28.5 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 19.0%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes $54.7 million tax expense for global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") and foreign-derived intangible income ("fdii"), net of credits, which increased our effective tax rate by 36.4%. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 includes a $334.8 million tax benefit related to intra-group transfers of certain intellectual property rights, which reduced our effective tax rate by 222.9%. the tax benefit for the intra-group asset transfers was primarily made up of $78.0 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate, as well as, the reversal of the pre-existing deferred tax liability of $259.9 million, which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer. we expect to be able to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets resulting from the intra-group asset transfers. it is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm's length standard is applied with respect to the valuation of intellectual property rights. the taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing the intellectual property rights transferred, which could increase our future effective income tax rate and harm future results of operations.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $27.5 million tax benefit received from current year generated r&d credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 13.4%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $13.3 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6.5%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $75.1 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 36.7%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes $95.4 million tax expense for gilti, which increased our effective tax rate by 46.7%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a $90.6 million tax benefit for business realignment, which reduced our effective tax rate by 44.3%.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes $644.7 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis, calculated under sab 118, related to the one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings, $136.7 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted u.s. statutory tax rate of 21.0%, and $20.5 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards. these three adjustments increased (reduced) our effective tax rate by 87.4%, (18.5%), and (2.8%), respectively. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $17.0 million tax benefit received from current year generated r&d credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 2.3%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $27.2 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.7%. our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a $11.3 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.5%.
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined u.s. federal and state effective tax rate. our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2020 was approximately 22% and our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2019 was approximately 22%. our non-u.s. blended statutory tax rates for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2020 and march 31, 2019 were much lower than this amount. the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors. our effective tax rate has been, and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.
our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in thailand, malta and ireland. our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant and equipment in thailand. our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.  microsemi was previously granted a tax holiday in malaysia, which expired in december 2019. the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the u.s. are earnings accrued in ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in malta at a 0% to 5% tax rate.
various taxing authorities in the u.s. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses.  companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  for u.s. federal, and in general for u.s. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. at this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. if this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. if the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
on july 27, 2015, in altera corp. v. commissioner, the u.s. tax court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. in the july 2015 ruling, the tax court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company's cost-sharing arrangement was invalid under the u.s. administrative procedures act. in june 2019, a panel of the ninth circuit of the u.s. court of appeals reversed this decision. in july 2019, altera petitioned u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case. in november 2019, the en banc rehearing petition was denied, and altera has asked the supreme court for a judicial review. due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations and questions related to the scope of potential benefits, we have not recorded any adjustments as of march 31, 2020. we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources we had $403.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at march 31, 2020, a decrease of $27.9 million from the march 31, 2019 balance.
net cash provided by operating activities was $1.54 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to $1.67 billion for fiscal 2019. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower net sales partially offset by increased operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring activities related to our acquisition of microsemi as well as working capital management.
net cash used in investing activities was $133.2 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $6.81 billion for fiscal 2019. fiscal 2020 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets. fiscal 2019 investing cash flows included net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of microsemi of $7.85 billion net of $340.0 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired, offset by net cash inflows of $1.29 billion due to the sale and maturity of available-for-sale debt securities to fund our acquisition of microsemi, and capital expenditures of $228.9 million.
our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. capital expenditures were $67.6 million and $228.9 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity, the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings. we currently intend to spend between $50 million and $70 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities. we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will be sufficient to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for new products and technologies, as well as to selectively bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
net cash used in financing activities was $1.44 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $4.66 billion for fiscal 2019. the cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 were favorably impacted by the net proceeds from amounts borrowed to fund our acquisition of microsemi. significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include:
•   in fiscal 2020, gross proceeds of $615.0 million from term loans made under the bridge loan facility used to settle $615.0 million in principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt, and $878.0 million and $188.0 million of cash used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, respectively,
•   in fiscal 2019, proceeds of $3.0 billion from term loans made under the term loan facility, net proceeds of $3.27 billion from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds of $1.99 billion from the issuance of our senior secured notes, $2.06 billion of cash used to repay microsemi's existing debt, and $1.09 billion of cash used to pay down the principal of our term loan facility, and
•   in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $350.1 million and $344.4 million, respectively.
on may 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of microsemi corporation, a publicly traded company headquartered in aliso viejo, california. we paid an aggregate of approximately $8.19 billion in cash to the stockholders of microsemi. the total consideration transferred in the acquisition, including approximately $53.9 million of non-cash consideration for the exchange of certain share-based payment awards of microsemi for stock awards for our common stock, was approximately $8.24 billion. in addition to the consideration transferred, we recognized $3.23 billion in liabilities in our consolidated financial statements of microsemi consisting of debt, taxes payable and deferred, pension obligations, restructuring, and contingent and other liabilities of which $2.06 billion of existing debt was paid off. we financed the purchase price using approximately $8.10 billion of borrowings consisting of $3.10 billion of loans under our revolving credit facility, $3.00 billion under the term loan facility, and $2.00 billion in newly issued senior secured notes. we incurred $22.0 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition. during fiscal 2020, we voluntarily prepaid $188.0 million of principal under the term loan facility. during fiscal 2019, we voluntarily prepaid $1.09 billion of principal under the term loan facility, of which $500.0 million was from funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility. at march 31, 2020, we had $1.72 billion of outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility compared to $1.91 billion at march 31, 2019.
in march 2020 and september 2019, we amended our credit agreement dated may 29, 2018, to, among other things, reduce the margin added to the interest rate on revolving loans under the credit agreement and amend certain negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens and enter into certain restrictive agreements. the amendments also allow us the option to factor receivables and certain related assets. the amendments lowered the revolving credit facility thereunder to $3.57 billion from $3.60 billion.
the credit agreement provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.57 billion, with a $250.0 million foreign currency sublimit, a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $25.0 million swingline loan sublimit. the credit agreement also provides for the term loan facility. the revolving credit facility consists of $3.57 billion of revolving loan commitments (the "2023 revolving loans") that terminate on may 18, 2023 (the "2023 maturity date").  the 2023 revolving loans bear interest, at our option, at the base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. at march 31, 2020, we had $2.39 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility compared to $3.27 billion at march 31, 2019. see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement.
the enactment of the act in 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries of u.s. corporations. due to this change, the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity.  future distributions of a significant portion of our non-u.s. assets to the u.s. will no longer be subject to u.s. federal taxation.  we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the u.s. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations.  although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.  at march 31, 2020, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. as of march 31, 2020, we held approximately 13.1 million shares as treasury shares.
on october 28, 2002, we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  to date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $4.2 billion. cash dividends paid per share were $1.465, $1.457 and $1.449 during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. total dividend payments amounted to $350.1 million, $344.4 million and $337.5 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. a quarterly dividend of $0.3675 per share was declared on may 7, 2020 and will be paid on june 4, 2020 to stockholders of record as of may 21, 2020. we expect the aggregate cash dividend for june 2020 to be approximately $90.3 million. our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our board.  our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive.  in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development.  we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.  the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash (including the impact of the act), demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or convertible debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt or through exchange transactions. such issuances or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to unfavorable market conditions resulting from the covid-19 virus or other factors, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.

(1)   capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property, plant and equipment. these obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of march 31, 2020, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.
(2)   other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries.
(3)   for purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2023 revolving loans outstanding at march 31, 2020 will be paid on may 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of such borrowings.
(4)   the term loan facility matures on may 29, 2025.
(5)   the bridge loan facility matures on march 26, 2021.
(6)   for purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 senior convertible debt will be paid on february 15, 2027, which is the maturity date of such debt.
(7)   for purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt will be paid on february 15, 2025, which is the maturity date of such debt.
(8)   for purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 junior convertible debt will be paid on february 15, 2037, which is the maturity date of such debt.
(9)   for purposes of this table, pension obligations due in more than 5 years represent the expected pension payments from 2026 through 2030. it excludes pension obligations subsequent to 2030.
(10)   during fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisionary one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $644.7 million, as a result of the act. as of december 31, 2018, with the conclusion of the measurement period in accordance with sab 118, we increased this amount by $13.1 million to $657.8 million, of which we expect cash payments of approximately $290.3 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the u.s. this tax is payable over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax payable each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, payable during fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026.
(11)   the contractual obligations do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made.
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services, with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries, are not included in the table above.  we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  for the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons.  we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.  we also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements (including guarantees)
as of march 31, 2020, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k with the exception of standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries. we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements. based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements. prior to fiscal 2020, we did not record any liability in connection with various operating leases for buildings and equipment entered into in the ordinary course of business. we recorded the associated lease obligations as a liability when we adopted the provisions of the accounting standard update 2016-02-leases, which was effective april 1, 2019. refer to note 1 and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard.
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.

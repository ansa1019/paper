attributable to conocophillips.
business environment and executiveoverview conocophillips is an independent e&p company with operations and activities in 17 countries.
our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in north america;
conventional assets in north america, europe, asia and australia; lng developments; oil sands in canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.
headquartered in houston, texas, at december 31, 2019, we employed approximately
10,400 people worldwide and had total assets of
$71 billion.
overview global oil prices continued to be volatile in 2019.
optimism about worldwide economic growth during the first quarter turned to pessimism in the second quarter as trade disputes dampened growth forecasts.
at the end of the second quarter, geopolitical tensions in the middle east, threatening the safe passage of supertankers carrying crude oil through the persian gulf, revived oil prices.
worldwide economic growth concerns returned in the third quarter to depress prices, only to be reversed again by geopolitical tensions in the middle east, as oilfield infrastructure in saudi arabia was attacked, temporarily disrupting approximately five percent of the world's oil supply.
production was restored relatively quickly, and prices settled in the fourth quarter.
brent crude averaged $64
per barrel in 2019, down nine percent from the prior year.
our business strategy anticipates prices will remain volatile and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, while retaining upside during periods of higher prices.
portfolio diversification and optimization, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital investment have positioned our company to navigate through volatile energy cycles.
our value proposition principles, namely, to focus on financial returns, maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver compelling returns of capital, and expand cash flow through disciplined capital investments, are being executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business.
these priorities are:
invest capital to sustain production and pay our existing dividend;
grow our existing dividend; maintain debt at a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating through price cycles; allocate greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to share repurchases and dividends;
and, invest capital in a disciplined fashion to grow our cash from operations.
we believe our commitment to our value proposition, as evidenced by the results discussed below, positions us for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility.
36
in 2019, we successfully delivered on our priorities.
we achieved production growth of five percent on a total boe basis compared with the prior year, with higher value oil volumes growing eight percent.
cash provided by operating activities of $11.1 billion exceeded capital expenditures and investments of $6.6 billion.
after repurchasing $3.5 billion of our common stock and paying $1.5 billion of dividends to shareholders, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $5.4 billion and $3.0 billion of short-term investments.
in october, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share and announced planned 2020 share buybacks of
$3 billion.
in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.

business environment brent crude oil prices averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from a low of $53 per barrel in january to a high of almost $75 per barrel in april.
the energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future.
commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business.
our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the foundational principles that underpin our value proposition;
focus on financial returns through cash flow expansion, maintain balance sheet strength and deliver peer-leading distributions.
operational and financial factors affecting profitability the focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include:
●
maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship.
safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate.
we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth.
demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on november 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our ghg emission intensity by 2030.
in december 2018, we became a founding member of the climate leadership council (clc), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and
38
environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.
in early 2019, we issued our first stand-alone climate-related risk report and incorporated this into our website during our annual sustainability report update.
our sustainability efforts continued through 2019 with a focus on advancing our action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights.
we are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved hse and operational performance.
●
focus on financial returns.
this is a core principle of our value proposition.
our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and continually optimizing our portfolio.
o maintain capital allocation discipline.
we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow.
as a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and lng facilities.
we allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low production decline.
cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.
fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price related inflation and g&a.
in setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using this cost of supply criteria, which should lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.
additional capital may be allocated toward growth, but discipline will be maintained.
our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend.
in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.
o control costs and expenses.
controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority.
we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-
dollar basis and a per-unit basis.
managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment.
the ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.
in 2019, our production and operating expenses were two percent higher than 2018, primarily due to costs associated with higher production volumes, which grew five percent during the same period.
o optimize our portfolio.
we continue to optimize our asset portfolio to focus on low cost of supply assets that support our strategy.
in 2019, we continued to dispose of or market certain non-core assets, including the u.k., australia-west and our niobrara assets in the lower 48.
additions to the portfolio were made in the lower
48 with bolt-on interests and acreage acquisitions, in alaska with the nuna discovery acreage acquisition, and internationally with entrance into argentina's neuquén and austral basins.
we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments.
39
●
maintain balance sheet strength.
we believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours.
our strong operating performance buffered by a solid balance sheet enables us to deliver on our priorities through the price cycles.
our priorities include execution of our development plans, maintaining a growing dividend, and repurchasing shares on a dollar cost average basis.
●
return value to shareholders.
we believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend supplemented by share repurchases.
in 2019, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.5 billion and repurchased
$3.5 billion of our common stock.
combined, our dividend and repurchases represented 45 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities.
since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased $9.6
billion of shares.
additionally, as of december 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority remained of the
$15 billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized.
in february 2020, we announced that the board of directors approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from $15
billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases.
whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including market conditions and other factors.
see risk factors "our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations."
in october 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share.
●
add to our proved reserve base.
we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:
o successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.
o application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
o purchases of increased interests in existing fields and bolt-on acquisitions.
proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs.
therefore, our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures.
in 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion boe from sales and purchases, was 100 percent.
increased crude oil reserves accounted for approximately
55
percent of the total change in reserves. our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019.
approximately 50 percent of organic reserve additions were from lower 48 unconventional assets.
the remaining additions were evenly distributed across the other operating segments.
in the five years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was negative 34 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period.
our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended december
31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 2.0 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 40 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period.
historically, our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production.
in the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays.
accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis.
in the three years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period.
our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december 31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities.
40
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive.
in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base.
as such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
●
apply technical capability.
we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans.
technical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.
companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations.
we have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to work and operate more efficiently.
predictive analytics have been adopted in our operations and planning process.
artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are being used for seismic advancements.
●
attract, develop and retain a talented work force.
we strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics.
we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best early career talent.
we also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad range of expertise and experience.
we promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees.
other factors affecting profitability other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
●
energy commodity prices.
our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas.
industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by opec, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions.
the following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for wti crude oil, brent crude oil and u.s.
henry hub natural gas:
41
brent crude oil prices averaged $64.30 per barrel in 2019, a decrease of 9 percent compared with
$71.04 per barrel in 2018.
similarly, wti crude oil prices decreased 12 percent from $64.92 per barrel in 2018 to $57.02 per barrel in 2019.
crude oil prices weakened year over year primarily due to ample global supplies and a decelerating global economy.
henry hub natural gas price averages decreased
15 percent from $3.09 per mmbtu in 2018 to
$2.63
per mmbtu in 2019.
natural gas prices weakened in 2019 versus the prior year due to strong production, while demand growth was dampened by mild weather.
our realized ngl prices decreased 34 percent from
$30.48 per barrel in 2018 to $20.09 per barrel in
2019.
ngl prices weakened year over year due to strong supply growth with only moderate demand growth.
our realized bitumen price increased 42 percent from $22.29 per barrel in 2018 to $31.72 per barrel in
2019.
curtailment orders imposed by the alberta government, which limited production from the province starting january 2019, provided strength to the wcs differential to wti at hardisty.
we continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through the utilization of downstream transportation solutions and implementation of alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs.
our worldwide annual average realized price decreased
9 percent from $53.88
per boe in 2018 to
$48.78
per boe in 2019 due to lower realized oil, natural gas and ngl prices.
north america's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance.
in recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the u.s.
although providing significant short-
and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments;
and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields.
should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible.
●
impairments.
we participate in a capital-intensive industry.
at times, our pp&e and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value.
we may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values.
as we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.
a sustained decline in the current and long-term outlook on gas price could affect the carrying value of certain lower 48 non-core gas assets and it is reasonably possible this could result in a future non-cash impairment.
for additional information on our impairments in 2019, 2018 and 2017, see note 9-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
●
effective tax rate.
our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures.
accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the "mix" of before-tax earnings within our global operations.
●
fiscal and regulatory environment.
our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the u.s.
civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments.
these changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to
42
increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.
our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.
outlook full-year 2020 production is expected to be 1,230
mboed to 1,270 mboed, including the impact of a recent third-party pipeline outage on the kebabangan field in malaysia.
first-quarter 2020 production is expected to be 1,240 mboed to 1,280 mboed.
production guidance for 2020 excludes libya.
operating segments we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region:
alaska, lower 48, canada, europe and north africa, asia pacific and middle east, and other international.
corporate and other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.
our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

(855)
2019 vs. 2018
net income attributable to conocophillips increased $932 million in 2019.
the increase was mainly due to:
●
a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k.
subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited.
●
an unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our cenovus energy (cve) common shares in 2019, as compared to a $436 million after-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018.
●
higher crude oil sales volumes due to growth in the lower 48 unconventionals and from the acquisition of incremental interests in operated assets in alaska during the second and fourth quarters of 2018.
●
the absence of premiums on early debt retirements totaling $195 million after-tax.
●
a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits recognized for malaysia block g.
●
a $151
million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules relating to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.
these increases in net income were partly offset by:
●
lower realized crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices.
●
the absence of a $774 million after-tax gain on the clair disposition in the u.k.
●
a $296
million after-tax impairment related to the sale of our lower 48 niobrara interests.
●
lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to $120 million of impairments to equity method investments in our lower 48 segment and a $118 million reduction in equity earnings at qg3 in our asia pacific and middle east segment due to a deferred tax adjustment.
●
higher exploration expenses, primarily in our lower 48 segment due to $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the central louisiana austin chalk trend.

income statement analysis
2019 vs. 2018
sales and other operating revenues decreased 11 percent in 2019, mainly due to lower realized crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices, partly offset by higher sales volumes of crude oil in the lower 48 and alaska.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $295 million in 2019, primarily due to impairments of equity method investments in our lower 48 segment totaling
$155 million.
additionally, equity earnings decreased $118
million resultant from a deferred tax adjustment at qg3, reported in our asia pacific and middle east segment.
for more information related to these items, see note 3-variable interest entities and note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
gain on dispositions increased $903 million in 2019, primarily due to a $1.7
billion before-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited.
partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of a $715 million before-tax gain on the sale of a conocophillips subsidiary to bp in 2018, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the bp-operated clair field in the u.k.
for additional information related to these dispositions, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other income increased $1,185 million in 2019, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million before-tax on our cve common shares in 2019, and the absence of a $437 million before-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018.
for discussion of our cve shares, see note
7-investment in cenovus energy, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
purchased commodities decreased 17 percent in
2019, primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil prices.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased
$155 million in 2019, primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and benefits, including mark to market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs, and increased facility costs.
exploration expenses increased $374 million in 2019, primarily due to higher leasehold impairment and dry hole costs, mainly in our lower 48 segment, and higher exploration g&a expenses.
in 2019, we recorded a
$141 million before-tax leasehold impairment expense due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the central louisiana austin chalk trend and expensed $111 million of dry hole costs related to this play.
impairments increased $378 million in
2019, mainly due to a $379 million before-tax impairment related to the sale of our niobrara interests in the lower 48 segment.
for additional information, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions and note 9-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other expenses decreased $310 million in
2019, primarily due to the absence of a $206
million before-tax expense for premiums on early debt retirements and lower pension settlement expense.

we explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls on a worldwide basis.
at december 31, 2019, our operations were producing in the u.s., norway, canada, australia, timor-
leste, indonesia, china, malaysia, qatar and libya.
2019 vs. 2018
total production, including libya, of 1,348 mboed increased 65 mboed or 5 percent in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to:
●
new wells online in the lower 48.
●
an increased interest in the western north slope (wns) and greater kuparuk area
(gka) of alaska following acquisitions closed in 2018.
●
higher production in norway due to drilling activity and the startup of aasta hansteen in december
2018.
the increase in production during 2019 was partly offset by:
●
normal field decline.
●
disposition impacts from the u.k. and non-core asset sales in the lower 48.
production excluding libya was 1,305 mboed in
2019 compared with 1,242 mboed in 2018, an increase of
63 mboed or 5 percent.
underlying production, which excludes libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 mboed in 2019 and 47 mboed in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically.
our underlying production grew 5 percent to 1,254
mboed in 2019
from 1,195 mboed in 2018.

the alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, ngls and natural gas.
in 2019, alaska contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.
2019 vs. 2018
alaska reported earnings of $1,520 million in
2019, compared with earnings of $1,814 million in 2018.
the decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher production and operating and dd&a expenses associated with incremental volumes from acquisitions completed during 2018.
additionally, earnings were lower due to the absence of a $98 million tax valuation allowance reduction, the absence of a $79 million after-tax benefit resulting from an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the ferc, and $62 million less in enhanced oil recovery credits.
partly offsetting these decreases in earnings, were higher crude oil sales volumes due to the gka and wns acquisitions completed in 2018.
average production increased 32 mboed in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to acquisitions at gka and wns in 2018, which provided an incremental
38 mboed of production in 2019, as well as volumes from new wells online.
these production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
acquisition update in the third quarter of 2019, we completed the nuna discovery acreage acquisition for approximately
$100
million, expanding the kuparuk river unit by
21,000 acres and leveraging legacy infrastructure.

the lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous u.s. and the gulf of mexico.
during
2019, the lower 48 contributed 39 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 22 percent of our natural gas production.
2019 vs. 2018
lower 48 reported earnings of $436 million in
2019, compared with $1,747 million in 2018.
earnings decreased primarily due to lower realized crude oil, ngl and natural gas prices; higher dd&a due to increased production volumes; a $301 million after-tax impairment of our niobrara assets;
higher exploration expenses, primarily due to a combined $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the central louisiana austin chalk; and lower earnings in equity affiliates due to a combined $120 million after-tax of impairments associated with a fair value reduction of our investment in mwcc and the disposition of our interests in the golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline.
partly offsetting the decrease in earnings were increased crude oil and ngl sales volumes in the eagle ford, bakken and permian unconventional.
for additional information related to our impairment of mwcc, see note 3-variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
for more information related to the sale of our interests in golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
total average production increased 54 mboed in 2019 compared with 2018.
the increase was primarily due to new production from unconventional assets in eagle ford, bakken and the permian basin, partly offset by normal field decline.
additionally, production decreased by 10 mboed due to non-core dispositions in 2018.
asset dispositions update in january 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in the golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline.
we have also entered into agreements to amend our contractual obligations for retaining use of the facilities.
as a result of entering into these agreements, we recognized a
before-tax impairment of $60 million in the first quarter of 2019 which is included in the "equity in earnings of affiliates" line on our consolidated income statement.
we completed the sale in the second quarter of 2019.
see note 15-fair value measurement in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our interests in the magnolia field and platform and recognized an after-
48
tax gain of $63 million.
production from magnolia in 2019 was less than one mboed.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the niobrara shale play for $380
million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells.
we recorded an after-tax impairment of $301 million in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value to fair value.
production from niobrara was approximately 11 mboed in 2019.
this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
in january 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain non-core properties in the lower
48 segment for $186 million, plus customary adjustments.
the assets met the held for sale criteria in january
2020 and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.
no gain or loss is anticipated on the sale.
this disposition will not have a significant impact on lower 48 production.
for additional information on these transactions, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

*average prices for sales of bitumen produced during 2018 and 2019 excludes additional value realized from the purchase and sale of third-
party volumes for optimization of our pipeline capacity between canada and the u.s. gulf coast.
our canadian operations consist of the surmont oil sands development in alberta and the liquids-rich montney unconventional play in british columbia.
in 2019, canada contributed 7 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than one percent of our worldwide natural gas production.
2019 vs. 2018
canada operations reported earnings of $279 million in 2019 compared with $63 million in 2018.
earnings increased mainly due to higher realized bitumen prices, a $68 million tax benefit primarily comprised of a previously unrecognizable tax basis related to a tax settlement, lower dd&a expense due to lower rates from
49
reserve additions, lower production and operating expenses, and a $25 million tax benefit due to a four year phased four percent reduction in alberta's corporate income tax rate.
partly offsetting the increase in earnings were lower sales volumes due to a planned turnaround at surmont, lower production due to a mandated production curtailment imposed by the alberta government in january 2019, and the absence of an $80 million tax restructuring benefit.
total average production decreased 7 mboed in 2019 compared with 2018.
the production decrease was primarily due to a turnaround at surmont, which had an annualized average impact of 3 mboed, and a mandated production curtailment imposed by the alberta government, which also impacted production by 3
mboed.
the curtailment program is established and administered by the alberta energy regulator under the curtailment rules regulation, which is currently set to expire on december 31, 2020.
this program is intended to strengthen the wcs differential to wti at hardisty.
asset disposition on may 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our
50 percent nonoperated interest in the fccl partnership, as well as the majority of our western canada gas assets to cenovus energy.
consideration for the transaction was $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments, 208 million cenovus energy common shares and a five year uncapped contingent payment.
the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6
million cad for every $1 cad by which the wcs quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 cad per barrel.
during 2019 and 2018, we recorded after-tax gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of
$84
million and $68 million, respectively.

the europe and north africa segment consisted of operations principally located in the norwegian and u.k.
sectors of the north sea, the norwegian sea and libya.
in 2019, our europe and north africa operations contributed 16 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 17 percent of our natural gas production.
2019 vs. 2018
earnings for europe and north africa operations of $2,724 million increased $858 million in 2019 compared with 2018.
the increase in earnings was primarily due to a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited.
earnings also increased due to the cessation of dd&a in the second quarter of 2019 for our disposed u.k. subsidiaries when these assets became held-for-sale.
partly offsetting the increase in earnings were the absence of a $774 million
50
after-tax gain related to the sale of a conocophillips subsidiary to bp, which held 16.5 percent of our 24
percent interest in the bp-operated clair field in the u.k.; lower sales volumes primarily due to the u.k.
disposition to chrysaor completed september 30,
2019; and lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices.
average production decreased 17 mboed in 2019, compared with 2018.
the decrease was mainly due to normal field decline and a 20 mboed disposition impact from the sale of our u.k. assets to chrysaor completed september 30, 2019.
partly offsetting these production decreases were volumes from new wells online in norway, including the aasta hansteen field which achieved first production in december of 2018.
asset disposition update on september 30, 2019, we completed the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited for proceeds of $2.2 billion after interest and customary adjustments.
in 2019, we recorded a $1.7
billion before-tax and $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with this transaction.
together the subsidiaries sold indirectly held our exploration and production assets in the u.k., including $1.8 billion of aro.
annualized average production associated with the u.k. assets sold was 50 mboed in 2019.
reserves associated with the u.k. assets sold were 84 mmboe at the time of disposition.

the asia pacific and middle east segment has operations in china, indonesia, malaysia, australia, timor-leste and qatar.
during 2019, asia pacific and middle east contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 60 percent of our natural gas production.
2019 vs. 2018
asia pacific and middle east reported earnings of $1,929 million in 2019, compared with
$2,070 million in
2018.
the decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower realized crude oil, ngl and natural gas prices;
lower lng and crude oil sales volumes; and lower equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to a deferred tax adjustment at qg3 that resulted in a $118 million reduction to equity earnings.
partly offsetting this decrease in earnings was a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits from the malaysia block g and a $52 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in the greater sunrise fields.
52
average production increased 1 percent in 2019, compared with 2018.
the increase was primarily due to new production from malaysia, including first gas supply from kbb to pflng1 in the second quarter of 2019 and first oil from gumusut phase 2 in the third quarter of 2019;
and new wells online in china, including bohai phase 3.
partly offsetting this production increase was normal field decline.
asset dispositions update in the second quarter of 2019, we recognized an after-tax gain of $52 million upon completion of the sale of our
30 percent interest in the greater sunrise fields to the government of timor-leste for $350 million.
no production or reserve impacts were associated with the sale.
in october 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our australia-west assets and operations to santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments, with an effective date of january 1, 2019.
in addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the barossa development project.
these subsidiaries hold our 37.5 percent interest in the barossa project and caldita field, our 56.9
percent interest in the darwin lng facility and bayu-undan field, our 40 percent interest in the greater poseidon fields, and our 50 percent interest in the athena field.
this transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other specific conditions precedent.
in 2019, production associated with the australia-west assets to be sold was 48 mboed.

2019 reserves associated with these assets were

the other international segment includes exploration activities in colombia, chile and argentina and contingencies associated with prior operations.
2019 vs. 2018
other international operations reported earnings of $263 million in 2019, compared with earnings of $364
million in 2018.
the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the recognition of $417 million after-tax in other income related to a settlement agreement with pdvsa in 2018, compared with $317 million after-tax associated with this settlement agreement in 2019.
in 2018 and 2019, we collected approximately
$0.8 billion of the $2.0 billion settlement with pdvsa.
pdvsa has defaulted on its remaining payment obligations under this agreement, we are therefore now forced to incur additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the agreement.
for additional information, see note 13-contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
argentina in january 2019, we secured a 50 percent nonoperated interest in the el turbio este block, within the austral basin in southern argentina.
in 2019, we acquired and processed 3-d seismic covering 500 square miles, with evaluation of the data ongoing.
in november 2019, we acquired interests in two nonoperated blocks in the neuquén basin targeting the vaca muerta play.
we have a 50 percent interest in the bandurria norte block and a 45 percent interest in the aguada federal block.
in bandurria norte, 1 vertical and 4 horizontal wells were tested and shut-in during
2019.
in aguada federal, 2 horizontal wells were being tested at the end of the year.

net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest.
net interest decreased $76 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects; increased interest income from holding higher cash balances; and lower interest on debt expense resultant from the retirement of $4.7 billion of debt in 2018; partly offset by the absence of an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the ferc.
corporate g&a expenses include compensation programs and staff costs.
these costs increased by $161
million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and benefits, including certain key employee compensation programs and higher facility costs.
technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues.
activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery and lng.
earnings from technology increased by $14 million in 2019 compared with
2018, primarily due to higher licensing revenues.
the category "other" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense.
earnings in "other" increased by $1,776 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our cve common shares in
2019, and the absence of a $436
million after-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018.
additionally, earnings increased due to the absence of $195 million in premiums on the early retirement of debt, lower pension settlement expense, and a $151 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.

to meet our short-
and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement.
in 2019, the primary uses of our available cash were $6,636 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program;
$3,500 million to repurchase our common stock;
$2,910 million net purchases of investments, and $1,500
million to pay dividends on our common stock.
during 2019, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $827
million to $5,088 million.
we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments.
our commitment to disciplined execution of these funding requirements includes cash investment strategies that position us for success in an environment of short-term price volatility as well as extended downturns in commodity prices.
the primary objectives of these cash investment strategies in priority order are to protect principal, maintain liquidity, and provide yield and total returns.
funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year.
funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year.
for additional information, see note 1-accounting policies and note
14-derivative and financial instruments.
significant changes in capital operating activities during 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $11,104 million, a 14 percent decrease from 2018.
the decrease was primarily due to lower prices, lower collections related to settlements reached with ecuador and pdvsa, and a pension contribution made in conjunction with the sale of two u.k. subsidiaries, partially offset by higher volumes.
while the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short-
and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls.
prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control.
absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
55
the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.

year production averaged 1,348 mboed in 2019.
full-year production excluding libya averaged

and is expected to be 1,230 to 1,270 mboed in 2020.
future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-
royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields;
field production decline rates; new technologies;
operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds;
political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development.
while we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.
our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline.
in 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion boe from sales and purchases, was 100
percent.
increased crude oil reserves accounted for approximately
55 percent of the total change in reserves.
our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019.
approximately 51 percent of organic reserve additions are from lower 48, 13 percent from alaska,
12 percent from canada, 12 percent from europe and north africa and 12 percent from asia pacific and middle east.
in the five years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a decrease of 2.0 billion boe from sales and purchases, was negative 34
percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period.
our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended december 31, 2019, was 40
percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period.
historically our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production.
in the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays.
accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis.
in the three years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period.
our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december
31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. for additional information about our
2020 capital budget, see the "2020 capital budget"
section within "capital resources and liquidity"
and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the
"oil and gas operations" section of this report.
as discussed in the "critical accounting estimates"
section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs.
we have reported revisions as increases to reserves in the current period, however in prior periods, reported revisions as decreases to reserves. it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
investing activities proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion.
we completed the sale of two conocophillips u.k.
subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited for $2.2
billion.
we also completed the sale of several assets including our 30 percent interest in the greater sunrise fields for $350 million and received $106 million of contingent payments from cenovus energy.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our australia-west assets and operations to santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments.
in addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the barossa development project.
also in the fourth
56
quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the niobrara shale play for $380 million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells.
both transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
investing activities in 2019 also included net purchases of $2.9 billion of investments in short-term and long-
term financial instruments. these investments include time deposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities classified as available for sale.
the investment in short-term instruments was $2.8 billion, the remaining $0.1 billion was invested in long-term debt securities.
for additional information, see note 14-
derivative and financial instruments.
proceeds from asset sales in 2018 were $1.1 billion.
we completed several undeveloped acreage transactions in our lower 48 segment for a total of $267 million after customary adjustments and another transaction in our lower 48 segment for $112 million after customary adjustments.
we completed the sale of our interests in the barnett to lime rock resources for $196 million after customary adjustments.
we also completed the sale of a conocophillips subsidiary to bp and received
$253 million net proceeds.
the subsidiary held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the bp-operated clair field in the u.k.
during 2018, we received $95 million of contingent payments from cenovus energy.
for additional information on our dispositions, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
commercial paper and credit facilities we have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in may 2023.
our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program.
the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.
the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the u.s.
the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.
the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports the conocophillips company $6.0 billion commercial paper program, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.
we had no commercial paper outstanding in programs in place at december 31,
2019 or december 31, 2018.
we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2019 and december
31, 2018.
since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to
$6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2019.
our current long-term debt ratings remained unchanged in 2019 and are as follows:
fitch - "a" with a "stable"
outlook; moody's investors services - "a3" with a "stable" outlook; and standard & poor's - "a" with a stable outlook.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating.
if our credit rating were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral.
many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters
57
of credit as collateral.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had direct bank letters of credit of $277 million and $323 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
in the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
for information about guarantees, see note 12-guarantees, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
capital requirements for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the "capital expenditures"
section.
our debt balance at december 31, 2019, was $14,895
million, a decrease of $73 million from the balance at december 31, 2018.
for more information on debt, see note 11-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
on january 30, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share.
the dividend was paid on march 1, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 11, 2019.
on may 1, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share.
the dividend was paid on june 3, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on may 13,
2019.
on july 11, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of
$0.305 per share.
the dividend was paid on september 3, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on july 22, 2019.
on october 7, 2019, we announced a 38 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share.
the dividend was paid on december 2, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on october 17, 2019.
in february 2020, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, payable march 2, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 14, 2020.
in late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program.
as of december 31, 2019, we had announced a total authorization to repurchase $15 billion of our common stock.
we repurchased $3 billion in 2017, $3
billion in 2018 and $3.5 billion in 2019.
of the remaining authorization, we expect to repurchase $3 billion in
2020.
in february 2020, we announced that the board of directors approved an increase to our authorization from $15 billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases.
whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, market conditions and other factors.
see risk factors -"our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations."
since our share repurchase program began in november 2016, we have repurchased 169
million shares at a cost of $9.6 billion through december 31, 2019.

our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended december 31,
2019, totaled $18.0
billion.
the 2019 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily:
●
development, appraisal and exploration activities in the lower 48, including eagle ford, permian unconventional, and bakken.
●
appraisal and development activities in alaska related to the western north slope; development activities in the greater kuparuk area and the greater prudhoe area; leasehold acquisition in the greater kuparuk area.
●
development activities across assets in norway, as well as for assets in the u.k. that recently have been sold.
●
optimization of oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in canada.
●
signature bonus for indonesia corridor block production sharing contract, as well as continued development in china, malaysia, australia, and indonesia.
2020 capital budget in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.
for information on puds and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the "oil and gas operations"
section in this report.
contingencies a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against conocophillips.
we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active
60
and inactive sites.
we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.
in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a
liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.
if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.
we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.
if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.
with respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
for information on other contingencies, see
"critical accounting estimates" and note 13-contingencies and commitments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
legal and tax matters we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.
our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations.
we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.
our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases.
this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation.
based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
see note 19-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry.
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
●
u.s. federal clean air act, which governs air emissions.
●
u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
●
european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals
(reach).
●
u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act
(cercla or superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
●
u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
●
u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.
●
u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
61
●
u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
●
u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s.
waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
●
european union trading directive resulting in european emissions trading scheme.
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming.
in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application.
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.
while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate.
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s. and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations.
a range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions.
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments.
we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements.
our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations.
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents.
longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute.
on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.
these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations.
as of december 31, 2019, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible
62
parties, is relatively low.
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval.
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $511 million in 2019 and are expected to be about $545 million per year in 2020 and 2021.
capitalized environmental costs were $194 million in 2019 and are expected to be about
$225 million per year in 2020 and 2021.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed.
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra or other agency enforcement activities.
the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.
in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2019, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of
$171 million, compared with $178 million at december 31,
2018, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada.
we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred.
however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
63
climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg reduction.
these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.
laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
●
european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the eu member states are implementing the kyoto protocol.
our cost of compliance with the eu ets in 2019
was approximately $8 million before-tax.
●
the alberta carbon competitiveness incentive regulation (ccir) requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity.
the total cost of these regulations in 2019
was approximately
$4 million.
●
the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa,
549 u.s. 497, 127 s.ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an "air pollutant"
under the federal clean air act.
●
the u.s. epa's announcement on march 29, 2010 (published as "interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs," 75 fed. reg. 17004 (april
2,
2010)), and the epa's and u.s. department of transportation's joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act, may trigger more climate-
based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
●
the u.s. epa's announcement on january 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry.
the former u.s. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40
to 45 percent by 2025.
●
carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.
our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2019 was approximately $30 million (net share before-tax).
we also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operations totaling just over $0.8 million (net share before-tax).
●
the agreement reached in paris in december 2015
at the 21
st conference of the parties to the united nations framework on climate change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions.
while the u.s. announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the u.s. will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by u.s. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the u.s.
in the u.s., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to ghg emissions.
such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.
such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas.
the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
●
whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
●
the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
64
●
the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.
●
the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
●
the ghg reductions required.
●
the price and availability of offsets.
●
the amount and allocation of allowances.
●
technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
●
any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
●
whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
the company has responded by putting in place a sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence.
we have developed a company-wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register.
the risks addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad categories:
●
ghg-related legislation and regulation.
●
ghg emissions management.
●
physical climate-related impacts.
●
climate-related disclosure and reporting.
emissions are categorized into different scopes.
scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions help us understand climate transition risk.
scope 1 emissions are direct ghg emissions from sources that we own or control.
scope 2 emissions are ghg emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume.
our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to run a ghg pricing sensitivity using a corporate price of $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, plus annual inflation, for all scope 1 and scope
2 ghg emissions produced in 2024 and later.
projects in jurisdictions with existing ghg pricing regimes must incorporate that existing ghg price and its forecast into their base case economics.
where the existing ghg price is below the corporate price, the
$40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent sensitivity must also be run from 2024 onward.
thus, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.
the company does not use an estimated market cost of ghg emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing ghg regulations.
in december 2018, we became a founding member of the clc, an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.
in 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and a state government in california, new york, washington, rhode island and maryland, as well as the pacific coast federation of fishermen's association, inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
conocophillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits.
the lawsuits brought by the cities of san francisco, oakland and new york have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending.
lawsuits filed by other cities and counties in california and washington are currently stayed pending resolution of the appeals brought by the cities of san francisco and oakland to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
lawsuits filed in maryland and rhode island are proceeding in state court while rulings in those matters, on the issue of whether the matters should proceed in state or federal court, are on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit and first circuit, respectively.
65
several louisiana parishes and individual landowners have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages in connection with historical oil and gas operations in louisiana.
all parish lawsuits are stayed pending an appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeals on the issue of whether they will proceed in federal or state court.
conocophillips will vigorously defend against these lawsuits.
other we have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards.
valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.
based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
see note 1-accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies.
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.
these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually.
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry.
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.
however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.
for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area.
for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
at year-end 2019, the remaining $3.5 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest.
of this amount, approximately
$2.1 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2020, and $0.6 billion is held for sale.
management periodically assesses individually
66
significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.
often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.
exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
for complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting.
once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment.
at year-end 2019, total suspended well costs were $1,020 million, compared with $856 million at year-end
2018.
for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 8-suspended wells and other exploration expenses, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.
reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits.
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of
"proved" reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved."
our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.
we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.
also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.
this estimated date when production
67
will end affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest"
method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset.
at year-end 2019, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $35 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in 2019 was approximately $5.8 billion.
the estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.3 billion boe at the end of 2018 and 3.2
billion boe at the end of 2019.
if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2019
would have increased by an estimated $642
million.
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed.
if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a
field-by-field basis for e&p assets.
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period.
see note 9-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount.
when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.
when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.
since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.
see the "aplng" section of note 6-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional
68
information.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.
the fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to pp&e at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs.
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult.
most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs.
asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets.
however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects.
these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the u.s. at exploration and production sites.
future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
see note
10-asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement.
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees.
due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements.
for employee retirement income security act-
governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans.
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects.
ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time.
projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption.
a
100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by
$1,000 million.
benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions.
a
100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by
$100 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million.
in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.
we are also exposed to the possibility
69
that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.
these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict.
in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss.
see note 18-employee benefit plans, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business.
management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes.
as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure.
however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages;
interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms;
expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies" section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 13-contingencies and commitments.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8. this discussion contains forward-looking statements. please see "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for a discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following:
workers' compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. certain insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim. we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs. we are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.
the amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates, policy expiration dates, and claim type. for 2017 and 2018, we were self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and self-insured for $100,000 per workers' compensation claim. for 2019, we were self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers' compensation claims for nearly all states. we have policies in place for 2020 with substantially the same terms as our 2019 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers' compensation, and cargo loss or damage.
our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability. this process involves the use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor, if applicable. in doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurred-but-not-reported claims. we do not discount our estimated losses. at december 31, 2019, we had an accrual of approximately $263 million for estimated claims. in addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims.  at december 31, 2019, we have recorded $281 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims, other insurance deposits, and prepaid insurance premiums.
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers, chassis, and trailers in connection with our business. this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements. in addition, we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under short-term rental arrangements. purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or trade-in value. we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31, 2019.
14
we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment. we have utilized these trade-in values, as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense.
revenue recognition we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services. accordingly, we serve as a principal in the transaction. we invoice our customers, and we maintain discretion over pricing. additionally, we are responsible for selection of third-party transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements.
we recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided, with related expenses recognized as incurred. accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.
our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments.  the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method. our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings. deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns. we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences. to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance is established. to the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our income tax provision.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the act) was enacted in december 2017. beginning in 2018, the act reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. at december 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future, which was generally 21%. the provisional amount recorded resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $309.2 million, which was included as a component of 2017 income tax from continuing operations. during 2018, we finalized our calculations for our 2017 federal income tax return, which was filed based on the law prior to the act, resulting in no significant change to the initial measurement of these balances. remaining aspects of the act were not relevant to our operations.
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes. as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements. such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates. further, a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved. see note 7, income taxes, in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies.

2019 compared with 2018
consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues increased 6.4% to $9.17 billion in 2019, compared to $8.61 billion in 2018, primarily due to increased revenue in dcs related to an increase in revenue producing trucks, higher truck productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, and an acquisition in the first quarter 2019. the increase in revenue was further attributable to increased load volumes in ics and higher revenue per load in jbi, partially offset by a decrease in jbi load volumes and a reduction in rates per loaded mile and the number of operating tractors in jbt. fuel surcharge revenues decreased 1.4% to $1.04 billion in 2019, compared to $1.06 billion in 2018. if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2019 revenue increased 7.5% over 2018.
consolidated operating expenses our 2019 consolidated operating expenses increased 6.3% from 2018, while year-over-year revenue increased 6.4%, resulting in a 2019 operating ratio of 92.0% compared to 92.1% in 2018.
rents and purchased transportation costs increased 2.1% in 2019, primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates within jbi and ics segments and jbi rail purchased transportation costs, including a $26.8 million charge in 2019, resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf. the current year increase in rents and purchased transportation costs was partially offset by a $152.3 million bnsf arbitration related charge recorded by jbi in 2018. salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 12.5% in 2019 from 2018. this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers. depreciation and amortization expense increased 14.5% in 2019, primarily due to equipment purchased related to new dcs long-term customer contracts.
16
fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 0.9% in 2019 compared with 2018, due primarily to an increase in road miles, partially offset by a decrease in the price of fuel during 2019. we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers. these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national, regional, or local fuel prices. while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue. as a result, some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues. due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly. it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.
operating supplies and expenses increased 9.7%, driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts, increased toll costs, higher travel costs, and higher facility maintenance expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 17.6% from 2018, primarily due to increased technology spend on the j.b. hunt 360 platform and legacy system upgrades, higher final mile services® (fms) network facility costs, and increased advertising expenses. additionally, net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $13.1 million in 2019, compared to net losses of $12.1 million in 2018. insurance and claims expense increased 21.5% in 2019, primarily due to 2019 including a $17.4 million reserve charge for arbitration related legal fees, costs and interest claimed by bnsf and the inclusion of a $20.0 million fms claim charge within dcs, partially offset by 2018 including specific reserve charges for the settlement of lawsuits with current and former drivers.
net interest expense for 2019 increased by 31.7% compared with 2018, due to an increase in average debt levels and higher effective interest rates on our debt.
our effective income tax rate was 24.2% in 2019 and 23.6% in 2018. the increase in 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in discreet tax benefits recognized related to share-based compensation vesting, partially offset by favorable settlements of state income tax audits during 2019.

jbi segment jbi segment revenue increased 1% to $4.74 billion in 2019, from $4.72 billion in 2018. this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 4% increase in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a 3% decrease in load volume. eastern network load volumes decreased 9% and transcontinental loads increased 1% compared to 2018. average length of haul increased 2% in 2019 when compared to 2018. revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 6% compared to 2018.
operating income of the jbi segment increased to $447 million in 2019, from $401 million in 2018. benefits from customer rate increases and freight mix were partially offset by decreased volumes, which includes volume lost to rail rationalization, increased rail purchased transportation costs, higher equipment ownership and maintenance costs, increased technology modernization expenses, lower box turns, higher box repositioning costs and increased driver wages and recruiting costs. current year operating income was further impacted by a $26.8 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf and a $17.4 million charge to insurance and claims expense, for arbitration related legal fees, costs and interest claimed by bnsf. jbi recorded $152.3 million of additional bnsf arbitration related charges in 2018. excluding these 2018 charges and the 2019 arbitration related charges of $44.2 million, operating income for 2019, decreased 11% when compared to 2018.
dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased 25% to $2.69 billion in 2019, from $2.16 billion in 2018. productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 8% when compared to 2018. productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 9% from 2018. the increase in productivity was primarily a result of the acquisition of cory 1st choice home delivery (cory), better integration of assets between customer accounts, customer rate increases, and increased customer supply chain fluidity during 2019 compared to 2018. in addition, the growth in dcs revenue includes an increase of $187 million in fms revenue, the majority of which was derived from the first quarter 2019 cory acquisition. dcs ended 2019 with a net additional 972 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2018. approximately 58% of these additions represent private fleet conversions and 15% represent fms versus traditional dedicated capacity fleets. customer retention rates remain above 98%.
operating income of our dcs segment increased to $269 million in 2019, from $193 million in 2018. the increase is primarily due to increased productivity and additional trucks under contract, partially offset by higher insurance and claims costs, which included a $20.0 million fms claim charge in the second quarter 2019, higher costs from the expanded fms network, increased driver wages and recruiting costs, and additional non-cash amortization expense of $3.8 million compared to 2018.
ics segment ics segment revenue increased 1% to $1.35 billion in 2019, from $1.33 billion in 2018. overall volumes increased 1%. revenue per load remained flat when compared to 2018 primarily due to customer mix changes, a lower spot pricing market and a competitive pricing environment for contractual truckload business, when compared to 2018. contractual business was approximately 71% of the total load volume and 59% of the total revenue in the 2019, compared to 70% of the total load volume and 48% of the total revenue in 2018.
ics segment incurred an operating loss of $11 million in 2019, compared to operating income of $50 million in 2018. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower gross profit margins, increased expenses to expand capacity and functionality of the marketplace for j.b. hunt 360, higher personnel costs, and increased digital marketing expenses. gross profit margin decreased to 13.1% in the current year versus 15.4% last year primarily due to weaker spot market activity and lower contractual rates on committed business compared to 2018. approximately $840 million of ics revenue for 2019 was executed through the marketplace for j.b. hunt 360 compared to $558 million in 2018. ics's carrier base increased 15%, and the employee count increased 6% when compared to 2018.

jbt segment jbt segment revenue decreased 7% to $389 million in 2019, from $417 million in 2018. excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2019 decreased 6% compared to 2018, primarily due to a 1% decrease in rates per loaded mile, a 3% decrease in length of haul and a 2% decrease in load volumes, compared to 2018. at the end of 2019, jbt operated 1,831 tractors compared to 2,112 at the end of 2018.
jbt segment had operating income of $29 million in 2019 compared with $37 million in 2018. the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower spot market activity, higher empty miles per load, increased driver wages and recruiting costs, and the reduction in overall load volumes.
2018 compared with 2017
consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues increased 19.8% to $8.61 billion in 2018, compared to $7.19 billion in 2017, primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in all four of our segments. fuel surcharge revenues increased 40.2% to $1.1 billion in 2018, compared to $754 million in 2017. if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2018 revenue increased 17.4% over 2017.
consolidated operating expenses our 2018 consolidated operating expenses increased 20.8% from 2017, while year-over-year revenue increased 19.8%, resulting in a 2018 operating ratio of 92.1% compared to 91.3% in 2017.
rents and purchased transportation costs increased 21.5% in 2018, primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume, which increased services provided by third-party rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments. in addition, our jbi segment incurred charges of $152.3 million to rail purchase transportation expense related to the arbitration with bnsf. salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 19.8% in 2018 from 2017. this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers. depreciation and amortization expense increased 13.7% in 2018, primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor, container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new dcs long-term customer contracts.
fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 32.1% in 2018 compared with 2017, due primarily to an increase in road miles and increases in the price of fuel during 2018. operating supplies and expenses increased 18.0%, driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts, higher travel costs, increased toll costs, and higher building maintenance expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 29.7% from 2017, primarily due to increased building and computer rentals, higher professional fees, higher advertising costs, higher bad debt expense driven by a customer bankruptcy, and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals, partially offset by the 2017 inclusion of a $20.2 million reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery. additionally, net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $12.1 million in 2018, compared to net losses of $7.4 million in 2017. insurance and claims expense increased 4.7% in 2018, primarily due to higher incident volume.
net interest expense for 2018 increased by 40.8% compared with 2017, due to an increase in average debt levels, higher effective interest rates on our debt, and expenses incurred to refinance our revolving line of credit compared to 2017.
our effective income tax rate was 23.6% in 2018 and (15.29%) in 2017. the increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $309.2 million decrease in income tax expense in 2017 resulting from adjustments to our deferred tax balances at december 31, 2017, for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the tax cuts and jobs act.
21
jbi segment jbi segment revenue increased 15% to $4.72 billion in 2018, from $4.08 billion in 2017. this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 2% increase in load volume and a 13% increase in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue. eastern network loads grew at 10% and transcontinental loads decreased 2% compared to 2017. average length of haul decreased 2% in 2018 when compared to 2017. revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 10% compared to 2017.
operating income of the jbi segment decreased to $401 million in 2018, from $407 million in 2017. benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs, which included $152.3 million of additional expense related to the arbitration with bnsf. benefits were further offset by higher driver wage and retention costs, higher driver recruiting expenses, higher outsourced dray costs, increased costs for onboarding and integration of container tracking technologies, higher equipment ownership costs, and costs of reduced efficiency and disruptions within the rail network. in addition, 2017 included a $20.2 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery.
dcs segment dcs segment revenue increased 26% to $2.16 billion in 2018, from $1.72 billion in 2017. productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 7% when compared to 2017. productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 5% from 2017. the increase in productivity was primarily a result of better integration of assets between customer accounts, customer rate increases, and increased customer supply chain fluidity during 2018 compared to 2017. in addition, the growth in dcs revenue includes an increase of $113 million in fms revenue, approximately $66 million of which was derived from the 2017 acquisition of special logistics dedicated, llc. dcs ended 2018 with a net additional 1,388 revenue-producing trucks when compared to 2017.
operating income of our dcs segment increased to $193 million in 2018, from $171 million in 2017. increased revenue and improved asset integration was offset by higher costs from the expanded fms network, increased driver wages and recruiting costs, higher non-driver salaries, wages and benefits, increased maintenance costs on equipment scheduled to be traded in the current year, higher overall insurance and claims costs, implementation costs for new customer contracts and approximately $4.4 million in additional non-cash amortization expense compared to 2017.
ics segment ics segment revenue increased 30% to $1.33 billion in 2018, from $1.02 billion in 2017. overall volumes increased 24%. revenue per load increased 5% primarily due to increased contractual and spot rates. contractual business was approximately 70% of the total load volume and 48% of the total revenue in 2018, compared to 70% of the total load volume and 53% of the total revenue in 2017.
operating income increased to $50 million in 2018, from $23 million in 2017. gross profit margin improved to 15.4% in the current year compared to 13.3% in 2017 primarily due to improved contractual margins and increased spot market activity. this increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher technology development costs, and increase bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy. approximately $558 million of ics revenue for 2018 was executed through the marketplace for j.b. hunt 360. ics's carrier base increased 29%, and the employee count increased 20% when compared to 2017.
jbt segment jbt segment revenue increased 10% to $417 million in 2018, from $378 million in 2017. excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2018 increased 9% compared to 2017, primarily from a 16% increase in rates per loaded mile, partially offset by an 4% decrease in load count.
22
jbt segment had operating income of $37 million in 2018 compared with $23 million in 2017. the increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher rates per loaded mile and lower equipment ownership costs, partially offset by increased driver wage and retention costs, higher driver and independent contractor recruiting expenses, and higher independent contractor costs per mile.
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.10 billion in 2019, compared to $1.09 billion in 2018. this increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings, partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $804 million in 2019, compared with $887 million in 2018. the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in equipment purchases, net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2019, partially offset by the purchases of cory and rdi last mile co. (rdi), which closed during the first and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively.
net cash used in financing activities was $267 million in 2019, compared with $208 million in 2018. this increase resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock purchased in 2019, partially offset by higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances, net of long-term debt repayments.
our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors, and payments are dependent upon our financial condition, liquidity, earnings, capital requirements, and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. we paid a $0.23 per share quarterly dividend in 2017, a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend in 2018, and a $0.26 per share quarterly dividend in 2019. on january 22, 2020, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.26 to $0.27 per share, which will be paid february 21, 2020, to stockholders of record on february 7, 2020. we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. however, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.
liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers, chassis, trucks, tractors, and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment. we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions. we obtain capital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt issuances. we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment. during the first and fourth quarters of 2019, we completed two separate business acquisitions. see note 12, acquisition, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. we used our existing revolving credit facility and cash to finance these transactions and to provide any necessary liquidity for current and future operations. these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our interest expense.
at december 31, 2019, we were authorized to borrow up to $750 million under a senior revolving line of credit, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2023. this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to $250 million and to request a one-year extension of the maturity date. the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate, the federal funds rate or libor, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees. at december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement.
our senior notes consist of three separate issuances. the first is $250 million of 3.85% senior notes due march 2024, which was issued in march 2014. interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year, beginning september 2014. the second is $350 million of 3.30% senior notes due august 2022, issued in august 2015. interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year, beginning february 2016. the third is $700 million of 3.875% senior notes due march 2026, issued in march 2019. interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year, beginning september 2019. we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively convert our $350 million of 3.30% fixed-rate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate, resulting in an interest rates of 3.27% at december 31, 2019. the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin. in addition, we previously had $250 million of 2.40% senior notes which matured in march 2019. the entire outstanding balance was paid in full at maturity.
23
our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31, 2019.
we believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
we are currently committed to spend approximately $938 million, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins, during 2020 through 2021, which is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors, containers, chassis, and other trailing equipment.

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $2.7 million at december 31, 2019, that expire at various dates in 2020, which are related to certain operating agreements and our self-insured retention levels for casualty and workers' compensation claims. we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third-party agreements. the table above excludes $55.4 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement. see note 7, income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.
we have two reporting segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services (dms), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, cloud, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, print and retail, and smart home and appliances industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. our dms segment includes customers primarily in the edge devices and accessories, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, our ability to purchase components and materials efficiently may contribute significantly to our operating results. while we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers, rising component and material prices may negatively affect our margins. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have reduced operating income margins.
we monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

(1)              the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.

(2)                                                 in connection with the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2014-09 (asu 2014-09), revenue recognition (topic 606), inventory turns are calculated based on inventory and contract asset balances for the three months ended august 31, 2019, may 31, 2019, february 28, 2019 and november 30, 2018.

(3)                                               during the three months ended november 30, 2018, the increase in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by the amended and new securitization programs and higher sales and timing of collections.

(4)                                                                                         in connection with the adoption of asu 2014-09, days in inventory are calculated based on inventory and contract asset balances for the three months ended august 31, 2019, may 31, 2019, february 28, 2019 and november 30, 2018. during the three months ended august 31, 2019, the decrease in days in inventory from prior sequential quarter was primarily due to increased sales activity during the quarter. during the three months ended february 28, 2019, days in inventory increased from the prior sequential quarter to support anticipated ramps and expected sales levels in the second half of fiscal year 2019 and due to the acquisition of certain assets of johnson &amp; johnson medical devices companies (jjmd) facilities at the end of february. during the three months ended november 30, 2018, days in inventory increased from the prior sequential quarter to support expected sales levels in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. during each of the three months ended august 31, 2018 and may 31, 2018, the decrease in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to increased sales activity during the quarter. during the three months ended february 28, 2018, the increase in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the increase in inventories to support expected sales levels in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 along with overall increased demand.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition effective september 1, 2018, our revenue recognition accounting policies changed in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. for further discussion, refer to note 18revenue to the consolidated financial statements. we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as manufacturing services), which encompasses the act of producing tangible products that are built to customer specifications, which are then provided to the customer.
we generally enter into manufacturing service contracts with our customers that provide the framework under which business will be conducted and customer purchase orders will be received for specific quantities and with predominantly fixed pricing. as a result, we consider our contract with a customer to be the combination of the manufacturing service contract and the purchase order, or any agreements or other similar documents.
the majority of our manufacturing service contracts relate to manufactured products which have no alternative use and for which we have an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date. as a result, revenue is recognized over time when or as we transfer control of the promised products or services (known as performance obligations) to our customers. for certain other contracts with customers that do not meet the over time revenue recognition criteria, transfer of control occurs at a point in time which generally occurs upon delivery and transfer of risk and title to the customer.
most of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct and is distinct within the context of the contract. for the majority of customers, performance obligations are satisfied over time based on the continuous transfer of control as manufacturing services are performed and are generally completed in less than one year.
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from electronic design services to certain customers. revenue from electronic design services is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.
for our over time customers, we believe the measure of progress which best depicts the transfer of control is based on costs incurred to date, relative to total estimated cost at completion (i.e., an input method). this method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because it results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of our to-date efforts in the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts in the satisfaction of the performance obligation. we believe that the use of an input method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. the transaction price of each performance obligation is generally based upon the contractual stand-alone selling price of the product or service.
certain contracts with customers include variable consideration, such as rebates, discounts, or returns. we recognize estimates of this variable consideration that are not expected to result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, primarily based on the most likely level of consideration to be paid to the customer under the specific terms of the underlying programs.
30
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances after considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost and net realizable value considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates.
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the
31
consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 4  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 17  new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.
results of operations refer to item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contained in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 for the results of operations discussion for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2017.
net revenue generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

2019 vs. 2018
net revenue increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018. specifically, the ems segment revenues increased 26% primarily due to (i) a 10% increase in revenues from new customers within our cloud business, (ii) an 8% increase in revenues from existing customers within our industrial and energy business, (iii) a 6% increase in revenues from existing customers within our networking and telecommunications business, (iv) a 5% increase in revenues from existing customers within our print and retail business and (v) a 1% increase in revenues spread across various industries within the ems segment. the increase is partially offset by a 4% decrease from existing customers within our computing and storage business and our capital equipment business, which we expect to remain weak into the second half of calendar year 2020. dms segment revenues remained consistent due to a 7% increase in revenues from new and existing customers in our healthcare and packaging businesses. the increase is offset by a 7% decrease in revenue from customers within our mobility business as a result of decreased end user product demand.
effective september 1, 2018, our revenue recognition accounting policies changed in conjunction with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. subsequent to adoption, we recognize revenue over time as manufacturing services are performed for the majority of our contracts with customers, which results in revenue being recognized earlier than under the previous guidance. revenue for all other contracts with customers will be recognized at a point in time, upon transfer of control of the product to the customer, which is effectively no change to our historical accounting. for further discussion of the new revenue recognition standard, refer to note 18revenue to the consolidated financial statements.

2019 vs. 2018
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, gross profit for our dms segment increased as a percentage of net revenue due to improved profitability across the various businesses. this increase was offset by a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in our ems segment due to continued weakness in the capital equipment business and ramp costs associated with new business awards. as a result, gross profit remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during the fiscal year end august 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year end august 31, 2018.

2019 vs. 2018
selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018. the increase is predominantly due to (i) a $48.4 million increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs primarily to support new business growth and development and our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company and (ii) a $44.6 million increase in acquisition and integration charges related to our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company. the increase is partially offset by an additional $32.4 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 as a result of the one-time modification of certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards and a one-time cash-settled award.

2019 vs. 2018
amortization of intangibles decreased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 primarily due to intangible assets related to the nypro acquisition, which were fully amortized during fiscal year 2018.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we made a strategic decision that the indefinite-lived trade name of $72.5 million acquired during the acquisition of nypro would be phased out over the next four years. in connection with a strategic shift to further diversify our portfolio, focus on innovation and technology within our healthcare business and as a result of the strategic collaboration with a certain medical device company, we decided to implement a rebranding initiative to jabil healthcare. management believes the name change better leverages the jabil brand and the full range of services available to our customers.
as a result of our decision to rebrand, we determined the indefinite-lived trade name should no longer be classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. as such, this trade name was assigned a four-year estimated useful life and will be amortized on an accelerated basis. see note 6  goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

$2.6 million, $16.6 million and $82.4 million recorded in the dms segment and $1.8 million, $4.0 million and $26.7 million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash settled.

(2)   fiscal year ended august 31, 2017, includes expenses related to the 2017 and 2013 restructuring plans.

2017 restructuring plan on september 15, 2016, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. this action included headcount reductions across our selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 restructuring plan).
the 2017 restructuring plan, totaling $195.0 million in restructuring and related costs, is complete as of august 31, 2019.
34
2020 restructuring plan on september 20, 2019, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to realign our global capacity support infrastructure, particularly in our mobility footprint in china, in order to optimize organizational effectiveness. this action includes headcount reductions and capacity realignment (the 2020 restructuring plan). the 2020 restructuring plan reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain locations are still subject to consultation with our employees and their representatives.
we currently expect to recognize approximately $85.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs primarily over the course of our fiscal year 2020. the charges relating to the 2020 restructuring plan are currently expected to result in cash expenditures in the range of approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million that will be payable over the course of our fiscal years 2020 and 2021. the exact timing of these charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. this information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. our estimates for the charges discussed above exclude any potential income tax effects.

2019 vs. 2018
restructuring of securities loss increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, due to the exchange of preferred stock of iqor holdings, inc. (iqor) during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 in association with iqors previously announced sale of its international logistics and product service assets. as a result of the restructuring, the company recognized a restructuring of securities loss, which primarily consisted of a credit loss. see note 16  fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

2019 vs. 2018
other expense increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, primarily due to: (i) $23.8 million related to an increase in fees associated with the utilization of the trade accounts receivable sales programs and additional fees incurred for the amendment of the foreign asset-backed securitization program and the new north american asset-backed securitization program. the increase was partially offset by (i) $5.0 million of other expense and (ii) $2.6 million of costs incurred during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, as a result of the early redemption of the 8.250% senior notes due 2018.

35
2019 vs. 2018
interest income increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 due to increased cash equivalents (investments that are readily convertible to cash with maturity dates of 90 days or less).

2019 vs. 2018
interest expense increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, due to additional borrowings on our credit facilities and higher interest rates. for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, additional borrowings were driven by the timing and scale of our ongoing new business ramps.

2019 vs. 2018
the effective income tax rate decreased for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, primarily due to: (i) $142.3 million of tax expense from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax act) for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018, (ii) $19.1 million of tax benefit for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 related to tax act adjustments and (iii) $17.5 million of tax benefit for the reversal of a u.s. valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019. the decrease was partially offset by $16.1 million of tax benefit from the lapse of statute in a non-u.s. jurisdiction and $14.8 million of tax benefit related to the release of stranded tax effects previously classified as accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018. refer to note 4  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the tax act.

non-gaap (core) financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, other than temporary impairment on securities, restructuring of securities loss, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-gaap core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.
we determine the tax effect of the items excluded from core earnings and core diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. in certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied.
we are reporting core operating income, core earnings and core return on invested capital to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-gaap financial measures.

(1)   the tax effect is calculated by applying the u.s. gaap effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 to u.s. gaap operating income less interest expense.

(2)   the tax effect is calculated by applying the core effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended august 31,
2019, 2018 and 2017 to core operating income less interest expense.

(3)                        the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the most recently-ended fiscal year to the account balance at the end of the prior fiscal year for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and dividing by two.

acquisitions and expansion during fiscal year 2018, the company and jjmd entered into a framework agreement to form a strategic collaboration and expand our existing relationship. the strategic collaboration expands our medical device manufacturing portfolio, diversification and capabilities.
on february 25, 2019 and april 29, 2019, under the terms of the framework agreement, we completed the initial closing and second closing, respectively, of our acquisition of certain assets of jjmd. the preliminary aggregate purchase price paid for both the initial closing and second closing was approximately $153.2 million in cash, which remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments. the acquisition of the jjmd assets has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. total assets acquired of $167.6 million and total liabilities assumed of $14.4 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. the final closing, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to occur during fiscal year 2020.
we are currently evaluating the fair values of the assets and liabilities related to this business combination. the preliminary estimates and measurements are, therefore, subject to change during the measurement period for assets acquired, liabilities assumed and tax adjustments. the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial results beginning on february 25, 2019 for the initial closing and april 29, 2019 for the second closing. we believe it is impracticable to provide pro forma information for the acquisition of jjmd assets.
on september 30, 2019 we completed the third closing of our acquisition of certain assets of jjmd for a cash payment of $117.1 million, primarily for inventory and the assumption of certain employee liabilities. the purchase price for the third closing is subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on conditions within the framework agreement.
refer to note 15  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, approved share repurchase programs, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common stock.
cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries.
as a result of the tax act and after the one-time transition tax on our historically untaxed foreign earnings, the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to u.s. federal income tax consequences upon subsequent repatriation to the united states. as a result, most of our cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2019 could be repatriated to the united states without potential tax consequences.

we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.
our senior notes and our 2017 and 2018 credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under our senior notes and the 2017 and 2018 credit facilities. refer to note 8  notes payable and long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
asset-backed securitization and trade accounts receivable sale programs asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our foreign asset-backed securitization program to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. effective october 1, 2018, the foreign asset-backed securitization program terms were amended and the program was extended to september 30, 2021. in connection with this amendment, there is no longer a deferred purchase price receivable for the foreign asset-backed securitization program as the entire purchase price is paid in cash when the receivables are sold.
as of october 1, 2018, approximately $734.2 million of accounts receivable sold under the foreign asset-backed securitization program was exchanged for the outstanding deferred purchase price receivable of $335.5 million. the remaining amount due to the financial institution of $398.7 million was subsequently settled for $25.2 million of cash and $373.5 million of trade accounts receivable sold to the financial institution. prior to the amendment, any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring was recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which was paid from available cash as payments on the receivables were collected. the amended foreign asset-backed securitization program contains a guarantee of payment by the special purpose entity, in an amount equal to approximately the net cash proceeds under the program. no liability has been recorded for obligations under the guarantee as of august 31, 2019.
the north american asset-backed securitization program was terminated on october 9, 2018 and as of this date approximately $500.0 million of accounts receivable sold under the program was exchanged for the outstanding deferred purchase price receivable of $300.0 million and $200.0 million of cash. the previously sold trade accounts receivable were recorded at fair market value.
on november 27, 2018, we entered into a new north american asset-backed securitization program. we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our new north american asset-backed securitization program to a special purpose entity, which in turn sells certain of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions on a monthly basis. there is no longer a deferred purchase price receivable for the north american asset-backed securitization program as the entire purchase price is paid in cash when the receivables are sold. additionally, certain unsold receivables covering the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of august 31, 2019.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, decreased inventories and non-cash expenses, partially offset by increased contract assets and accounts receivable. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of collections on accounts receivable sold under the securitization programs and the timing of purchases and cash payments. the decrease in inventories is primarily due to the adoption of asu 2014-09 and the reclassification to contract assets for revenue recognized for over time customers, partially offset by an increase in inventories to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. the increase in contract assets is due to the adoption of asu 2014-09 and the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the amended and new securitization programs and higher sales and timing of collections.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments and expenditures for assets acquired in connection with the initial and second closings of the acquisition of certain assets of jjmd, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment and cash receipts on sold receivables under the asset-backed securitization programs.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock, (iii) dividend payments and (iv) treasury stock minimum tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

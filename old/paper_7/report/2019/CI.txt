management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of december 31, 2019 compared with december 31, 2018 and our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared with 2018 and 2017. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the risk factors contained in part 1a of this form 10-k. for comparisons of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 with 2017 please refer to the previously filed md&a included in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
in this md&a, our consolidated measures "adjusted income from operations," earnings per share on that same basis, and "adjusted revenues" are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures of "shareholders' net income," "earnings per share" and "total revenues." we also use pre-tax adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments.
we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders' net income (or income before taxes for the segment metric) excluding realized investment gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, results of anthem and coventry health care inc. ("coventry") (collectively, the "transitioning clients") (see the "key transactions and developments" section of the md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients) and special items. cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. income or expense amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of underlying performance or the responsibility of operating segment management include:
realized investment gains (losses) including changes in market values of certain financial instruments between balance sheet dates, as well as gains and losses associated with invested asset sales.
amortization of acquired intangible assets because these relate to costs incurred for acquisitions.
results of transitioning clients because those results are not indicative of ongoing results.
special items, if any, that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to the nature or size of these matters. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of special items.
the term "adjusted revenues" is defined as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: revenue contributions from transitioning clients, special items and cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting. we exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business.

commentary: 2019 versus 2018
unless indicated otherwise, the commentary presented below, and in the segment discussions that follow, compare results for the year ended december 31, 2019 with results for the year ended december 31, 2018.
earnings and revenue shareholders' net income increased, primarily driven by the earnings contribution from express scripts and improved results in the integrated medical segment partially offset by interest expense on debt issued to finance the express scripts acquisition. earnings per share also increased, but at a significantly lower rate, reflecting dilution from the shares issued in connection with the express scripts acquisition.
adjusted income from operations increased, primarily driven by earnings from express scripts' pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment and improved results in integrated medical. these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reported in corporate from both debt issued to finance the acquisition and debt assumed from express scripts. adjusted income from operations per share also increased, but at a significantly lower rate, reflecting dilution from the shares issued to acquire express scripts.
medical customers increased, primarily attributable to growth in the select and middle market segments, partially offset by a decline in the national accounts and individual market segments.
revenue growth primarily reflected the addition of express scripts and, to a lesser extent, business growth in the integrated medical segment. detailed revenue items are discussed further below.
opharmacy revenues in 2019 reflected the express scripts pharmacy benefit management business. in 2018, we reported pharmacy revenues from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018. see the health services segment section of this md&a for further discussion of pharmacy revenues.
opremiums increased, primarily resulting from: 1) customer growth across all segments, predominantly integrated medical 2) rate increases in integrated medical reflecting underlying medical cost trends and 3) the addition of express scripts' medicare part d business.
ofees and other revenues increased primarily driven by contributions from express scripts' health management business reported in the health services segment. higher fees in our integrated medical segment primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses also contributed to the increase.
onet investment income decreased, primarily reflecting the absence of investment income earned in the fourth quarter of 2018 on debt proceeds used to acquire express scripts in december 2018.
other components of consolidated results of operations
pharmacy and other service costs. in 2019, this amount was primarily comprised of the express scripts' pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment. in 2018, we reported activity from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018.
medical costs and other benefit expenses increased, primarily due to medical cost inflation in integrated medical, customer growth in the insured business and the addition of express scripts' medicare part d business.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to the addition of express scripts and, to a lesser extent, volume-related expenses in integrated medical. these increases were partially offset by suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2019.
amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 primarily reflected the impact of the express scripts acquisition.
interest expense and other increased significantly, primarily due to interest incurred on debt issued in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the express scripts acquisition and interest incurred on express scripts' debt assumed upon closing of the acquisition.
realized investment gains (losses). we reported realized investment gains in 2019, compared with losses in 2018. the improvement primarily resulted from gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, higher gains on sales of debt securities and favorable market value adjustments on equity securities.
54
the consolidated effective tax rate declined, primarily due to suspension of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax in 2019 and recognition of incremental state tax benefits in the second quarter of 2019.
key transactions and business developments merger with express scripts as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, cigna acquired express scripts on december 20, 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at $52.8 billion. the "liquidity" section of this md&a provides further discussion of the impact of the acquisition on our liquidity and capital resources.
we continue to incur costs related to this transaction, including costs to integrate the cigna and express scripts operations. these costs are being reported in "integration and transaction-related costs" as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business.
on january 30, 2019, anthem exercised its early termination right and terminated their pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us, effective march 1, 2019. there is a twelve-month transition period ending march 1, 2020. the transition of anthem's customers occurred at various dates, as informed by anthem's technology platform migration schedule. in 2019 and 2018, we excluded the results of express scripts' contract with anthem (and also coventry) from our non-gaap reporting metrics "adjusted revenues" and "adjusted income from operations" and referred to these clients as "transitioning clients." as of december 31, 2019, the transition of customers was substantially complete; therefore, beginning in 2020, we will no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations.
agreement to sell group disability and life business as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in december 2019, cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for $6.3 billion. the "liquidity" section of this md&a provides further discussion of the impact of the pending divestiture on our liquidity and capital resources.
organizational efficiency plan as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs. as a result we recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $207 million, pre-tax ($162 million, after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019. we expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $180 million. a substantial portion of the savings is expected to be realized in 2020.

industry developments and other matters the "business - regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act ("aca") provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care and pharmacy services businesses, including regulations issued by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). the health care and pharmacy services businesses continue to operate in a dynamic environment, and the laws and regulations applicable to these businesses, including the aca, continue to be subject to legislative, regulatory and judicial challenges. the table presented below provides an update on the expected impact of these items and other matters as of december 31, 2019.

ma rates: final ma reimbursement rates for 2020 were published by cms in april 2019. preliminary ma reimbursement rates for 2021 were published by cms in february 2020. we do not expect the new rates to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2020 and 2021. risk adjustment: as discussed in the "regulation" and "risk factors" sections of this form 10-k, our ma business is subject to reviews, including risk adjustment data validation ("radv") audits by cms and the office of the inspector general ("oig"). we expect that cms, oig and other federal agencies will continue to closely scrutinize components of the medicare program. the "regulation" section of this form 10-k also discusses a proposed rule issued by cms in 2018 for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years that included, among other things, extrapolation of the error rate related to radv audit findings without applying the adjustment for underlying fee-for-service data errors as currently contemplated by cms's radv audit methodology. radv audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process. cms has announced its intent to use third-party auditors to audit all medicare advantage contracts by either a comprehensive or a targeted radv review for each contract year. if the proposed rule is adopted in its current form, it could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits, higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all ma insurers. the company, along with other ma organizations and additional interested parties, submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. the comment period concluded on august 28, 2019. if cms adopts the rule as proposed, there could be a material impact on the company's future results of operations, though we expect the rule would be subject to legal challenges. in addition, the company is subject to oig radv audits that are in process. the u.s. department of justice also is currently conducting an industry-wide investigation of risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

aca cost-sharing reduction subsidies: the aca provides for cost-sharing reductions that offset the amount that qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copays and coinsurance. the federal government stopped funding insurers for the cost-sharing reduction subsidies in 2017. certain insurers have sued the federal government for failure to pay cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the matter remains unresolved. to date, judges in six of those actions have ruled in favor of the insurers, five of which are presently under appeal. the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral argument in the first set of consolidated appeals on january 9, 2020. we will continue to monitor developments. our premium rates for the 2019 and 2020 plan years reflected a lack of government funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

risk mitigation programs - individual aca business in 2016, we recorded an allowance for the entire balance of our aca risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit. during 2018, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that health insurers are not entitled to receive amounts due under the risk corridor program that have been withheld by congress. the plaintiffs petitioned the u.s. supreme court to review this unfavorable decision. during the second quarter of 2019, the u.s. supreme court agreed to review the unfavorable lower court rulings in the risk corridor cases, and heard oral arguments on december 10, 2019. we now await a decision, which is expected by june 2020. we continue to carry an allowance for the balance of our aca risk corridor receivables of $109 million. no other significant updates occurred in 2019 related to the risk corridor legal matters.
risk adjustment balances are subject to audit adjustment by cms following each program year. in april 2019, cms published the final notice of benefit and payment parameters for the 2020 plan year that clarified the 2017 benefit year radv program. cms released the 2017 benefit year data validation error rates in may and published the preliminary radv transfers in august 2019. based on the information currently available, we adjusted our risk adjustment balance to reflect the expected outcome of the radv program.
the following table presents our balances associated with the risk adjustment program as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, inclusive of the radv adjustments recorded in 2019.

liquidity we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:
·medical costs, pharmacy and other benefit payments;
·expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs;
income taxes; and
debt service.
58
our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by:
·maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;
·using cash flows from operating activities;
matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;
selling investments; and
borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:
·debt service and dividend payments to shareholders;
·lending to subsidiaries as needed; and
pension plan funding.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:
·maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;
·collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
·using proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock; and
borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
dividends from our insurance, health maintenance organization ("hmo") and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions. most of express scripts' subsidiaries provide significant financial flexibility to cigna because they are not subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends.

the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs, premiums, fees, investment income, taxes, benefit costs and other expenses.
cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the settlement timing of payables and accrued liabilities. these increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections.
59
investing and financing activities our most significant investing and financing activities in 2018 related to acquiring express scripts. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition. cigna financed a portion of the acquisition in cash, primarily with debt financing as shown above and described more fully in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, with the remaining required cash coming from cash on hand. in 2018, cigna also acquired onepath life for approximately $480 million, largely with cash held in our foreign operations.
cash used for investing activities decreased, primarily due to the absence of cash paid to acquire express scripts in 2018 and lower net investment purchases, partially offset by higher property and equipment purchases.
cash used for financing activities increased, primarily due to the absence of the express scripts acquisition debt financing activities in 2018, higher repayments of long-term debt and share repurchases.
we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans. the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
in 2019, we repurchased 11.8 million shares for approximately $2.0 billion. from january 1, 2020 through february 26, 2020 we repurchased 2.0 million shares for approximately $425 million. share repurchase authority was $3.5 billion as of february 26, 2020.
capital resources our capital resources (primarily cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
our acquisition of express scripts increased our debt and shareholders' equity in 2018 as follows:
stock. express scripts' shareholders received 0.2434 of a share of common stock of cigna for every one share of express scripts' common stock. cigna issued 137.6 million additional shares to express scripts' shareholders.
debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the debt issued to finance the acquisition.
assumption of express scripts' senior notes. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the notes assumed in the acquisition of express scripts.
at december 31, 2019, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 45.2%, a decline from 50.9% at december 31, 2018. we have a near-term focus on accelerated debt repayment and expect to continue to deleverage into the upper 30%s by the end of 2020 using cash flows from operating activities.
in december 2019, cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for $6.3 billion. the sale is expected to close by the third quarter of 2020 subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. cigna estimates to receive approximately $5.3 billion of net after-tax proceeds from this transaction and expects to use these proceeds for share repurchase and repayment of debt in 2020.
in 2018, cigna entered into a new revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition. cigna had $10 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31, 2019. in 2019, cigna entered into an additional 364-day revolving credit agreement that matures in october 2020. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revolving credit agreements.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.
60
we prioritize our use of capital resources to:
provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations;
consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and
return capital to investors primarily through share repurchases.
our capital management strategy to support the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations and certain international growth initiatives is to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings generated by our foreign operations. this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states.
liquidity and capital resources outlook we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs through our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flows from operations, commercial paper program, credit agreements, and the issuance of long-term debt. as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately $1.1 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonregulated subsidiaries. we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy. a description of our outstanding debt can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2019, our unfunded pension liability was $873 million, reflecting an increase of $ 283 million from december 31, 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in discount rates of approximately 90 basis points and an update to mortality assumptions. we currently expect 2020 and 2021 required contributions to be immaterial. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans.
our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section in this form 10-k. though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could increase costs or affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings. in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, the parent company can borrow an additional $1.0 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without further state approval.
guarantees and contractual obligations we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. see the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations are as follows as of december 31, 2019:

on balance sheet:
insurance liabilities. excluded from the table above are $4 billion of insurance liabilities ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $1 billion in future policy benefits) associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses, as well as the reinsured workers' compensation, personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows. excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $23 billion recorded on the balance sheet (including $6 billion reported in liabilities held for sale) because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above.
ocontractholder deposit funds: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability. expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
ofuture policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted. the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb," reported in future policy benefits) do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.
long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments and current maturities of long-term debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding long-term debt. finance leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage, servers and equipment. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases.
operating leases: see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") contracts (without considering any related reinsurance arrangements), pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities. estimated payments of $91 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2020 and they are reflected in the above table. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2020 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension obligations.
the table above excludes the liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments. in the event we are unable to sustain all of our $1 billion of uncertain tax positions it could result in future tax payments of approximately $760 million. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions.

our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support. we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements, but do not anticipate doing so at this time. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
guarantees we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below. we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables, there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions and certain compensation accruals.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for assessing impairment of goodwill and debt securities carried at fair value below cost.

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets at the acquisition date. intangible assets primarily reflect the value of customer relationships and other intangibles acquired in business combinations. fair values of reporting units are estimated using models and assumptions that we believe a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price. the significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. a discount rate is selected to correspond with each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that used for investment decisions considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within each reporting unit. projections of future cash flows for each reporting unit are consistent with our annual planning process for revenues, pharmacy costs, benefits expenses, operating expenses, taxes, capital levels and long-term growth rates. in addition to these assumptions, we consider market data to evaluate the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of intangibles and the amortization method were determined using an income approach that relies on projected future cash flows including key assumptions for customer attrition and discount rates. management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. we completed our normal annual evaluations for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the third quarter of 2019. the evaluations indicated that the fair value estimates of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by sufficient margins and no impairments were required. goodwill and other intangibles as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - goodwill $44,602; other intangible assets $36,5622018 - goodwill $44,505; other intangible assets $39,003 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.   if we do not achieve our earnings and cash flow projections or our cost of capital rises significantly, the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluations could be adversely affected and result in future impairment charges that would negatively impact our operating results and financial position. specific to the government reporting unit, future changes in the funding for our medicare programs by the federal government could materially reduce revenues and profitability and have a significant impact on its fair value.

income taxes - uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits are more likely than not to be sustained on audit based on their technical merits. if not, we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. these amounts primarily relate to federal and state uncertain positions of the value and timing of deductions and uncertain positions of attributing taxable income to states. balances that are included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows: 2019 - $1.0 billion2018 - $928 million see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion around uncertain tax positions and the liquidity and capital resources section of this md&amp;a for a discussion of their potential impact on liquidity.   the factors that could impact our estimates of uncertain tax positions include the likelihood of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position and related assumed interest and penalties. if our positions are upheld upon audit, our net income would increase.

unpaid claims and claim expenses - integrated medical unpaid claims and claim expenses include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported. unpaid claims and claim expenses in integrated medical are primarily impacted by assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend. variation of actual results from either assumption could impact the unpaid claims balance as noted below. a large number of factors may cause the medical cost trend to vary from the company's estimates, including: changes in health management practices, changes in the level and mix of benefits offered and services utilized, and changes in medical practices. completion factors may be affected if actual claims submission rates from providers differ from estimates (that can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), or if changes to the company's internal claims processing patterns occur. unpaid claims and claim expenses for the integrated medical segment as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - gross $2,892; net $2,5892018 - gross $2,697; net $2,433 these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.   based on studies of our claim experience, it is reasonably possible that a 100 basis point change in the medical cost trend and a 50 basis point change in completion factors could occur in the near term. a 100 basis point increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase this liability by approximately $40 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $35 million after-tax, and a 50 basis point decrease in completion factors would increase this liability by approximately $85 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $70 million after-tax.

unpaid claims and claim expenses - long-term disability reserves the liability for long-term disability reserves is the present value of estimated future benefits payments over the expected disability period and includes estimates for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported. key assumptions in the calculation of long-term disability reserves include the discount rate and claim resolution rates, both of which are reviewed annually and updated when experience or future expectations would indicate a necessary change. the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the projected future benefit payments to their present value. the discount rate assumption is based on the projected investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves. claim resolution rate assumptions involve many factors including claimant demographics, the type of contractual benefit provided and the time since initially becoming disabled. the company uses its own historical experience to develop its claim resolution rates. long-term disability reserves as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): 2019 - gross $4,308; net $4,1912018 - gross $4,069; net $3,975 these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance recoverables and are included in liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. see note 9c. to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.   based on recent and historical resolution rate patterns and changes in investment portfolio yields, it is reasonably possible that a five percent change in claim resolution rates and a 25 basis point change in the discount rate could occur. a five percent decrease in the claim resolution rate would increase long-term disability reserves by approximately $95 million and decrease net income by approximately $75 million after-tax. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase long-term disability reserves by approximately $45 million and decrease net income by approximately $35 million after-tax.

segment reporting the following section of this md&a discusses the results of each of our segments. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments.
in segment discussions, we present adjusted revenues and "pre-tax adjusted income from operations," defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains (losses), amortization of acquired intangible assets, results of transitioning clients, (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and special items. ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as pre-tax adjusted income from operations. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pre-tax adjusted income from operations, as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues. note 23 to the consolidated financial statements also explains two additional items that are important in understanding our segment results: 1) segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate and 2) beginning in the first quarter of 2019, compensation cost for stock options is recorded by the segments. prior year segment information was not restated for this change in stock option reporting.
in these segment discussions, we also present "pre-tax adjusted margin," defined as pre-tax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues.
see the md&a executive overview for summarized financial results of each of our segments.
health services segment the health services segment includes pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy services, clinical solutions, home delivery and health management services. this segment includes express scripts' business from the december 20, 2018 date of acquisition except for express scripts' medicare part d business that is reported in the government operating segment of our integrated medical segment. this segment also includes cigna's legacy home delivery pharmacy business. due to the timing of the acquisition, results of operations in 2018 only included results from the express scripts' business for the period following the acquisition on december 20, 2018. the main driver of period over period increases in the financial information presented below was the results from the express scripts' business in 2019. as described in the introduction to segment reporting, performance of the health services segment is measured using pre-tax adjusted income from operations.
the key factors that impact health services revenues and costs of revenues are volume, mix and price. these key factors are discussed further below. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment.
as our clients' claim volumes increase or decrease, our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts.
the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling. as our mix of drugs changes, our resulting pharmacy revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly may increase or decrease. the primary driver of fluctuations within our mix of claims is the generic fill rate. generally, higher generic fill rates reduce revenues, as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace. however, as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients, higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit. the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications (such as therapies for chronic conditions) commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks.
our client contract pricing is impacted by our ability to negotiate supply chain contracts for pharmacy network, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates. as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients, we are continuously innovating and optimizing the supply chain. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of supply chain initiatives implemented. inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals. therefore, the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues.
in this md&a, we present revenues and gross profit "excluding transitioning clients" in addition to those metrics including transitioning clients. pre-tax adjusted income from operations and pre-tax adjusted margin exclude contributions from transitioning

clients. see the "key transactions and business developments" section of this md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information.

our debt securities portfolio increased during 2019 reflecting increased valuations due to decreases in market yields, partially offset by net sales and maturities. as of december 31, 2019, $21.2 billion, or 90% of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent) and the remaining $2.5 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy. investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry as appropriate.
foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia, primarily south korea, consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations. corporate debt securities include private placement assets of $7.5 billion. these investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.
in addition to amounts classified as debt securities in our consolidated balance sheets, we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50% ownership interest. this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately $8.1 billion supporting its business that is primarily invested in chinese corporate and government debt securities. we account for this joint venture on the equity method of accounting and report it in other assets. there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31, 2019.
commercial mortgage loans our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.
commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for well-leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics.
as of december 31, 2019, the $1.9 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 65 loans that are in good standing. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.
other long-term investments other long-term investments of $ 2.4 billion as of december 31, 2019 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. these entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately-held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 160 separate partnerships and approximately 80 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeded 5% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
73
problem and potential problem investments
"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment is more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems.
the amount of problem or potential problem investments as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 was not material.
investment outlook public equity markets rallied during 2019, reflecting the continued strength of the u.s. economy. however, concerns related to trade and tariffs continue to contribute to financial market volatility. we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions and trends, including uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's process of exiting the european union, and their potential impact on our investment portfolio. we expect continued volatility in certain sectors, such as retail, energy and natural gas. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
market risk financial instruments our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. consistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments:
changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;
changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and
changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities. because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:
interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return.
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, chinese yuan renminbi, new zealand dollar, and taiwan dollar. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:
investment/liability matching. we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.
use of local currencies for foreign operations. we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets.
use of derivatives. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

effect of market fluctuations assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:

100 basis point increase in interest rates (excluding long-term debt)       $ 1.6       $ 1.6
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies                      $ 0.3       $ 0.4
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates, primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling.
in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the fair value of the company's long-term debt would decrease approximately $2.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2018. changes in the fair value of our long-term debt do not impact our financial position or operating results. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company's debt.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as debt securities, cash, and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities.

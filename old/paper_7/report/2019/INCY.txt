overview incyte is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. our global headquarters is located in wilmington, delaware. we conduct our european clinical development and commercial operations from our offices in geneva, switzerland and lausanne, switzerland, and we conduct our japanese operations from our office in tokyo.
jakafi (ruxolitinib) is our first product to be approved for sale in the united states. it is an oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor and was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) in november 2011 for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, in december 2014 for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea and in may 2019 for the treatment of steroid‐refractory acute graft‐versus‐host disease (gvhd) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera are both rare blood cancers, and gvhd is an adverse immune response to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
in june 2016, we acquired from ariad pharmaceuticals, inc. (ariad) all of the outstanding shares of ariad pharmaceuticals (luxembourg) s.à.r.l., the parent company of ariad's european subsidiaries responsible for the
57
development and commercialization of iclusig in the european union and other countries, including switzerland, norway, turkey, israel and russia. we obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize iclusig in those countries. iclusig is approved in the european union for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are resistant to or intolerant of certain second-generation bcr-abl inhibitors and all patients who have the t3151 mutation.
under our collaboration agreement with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd., novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the united states for all hematologic and oncologic indications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the united states under the name jakavi. in april 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the gvhd field.
under our collaboration agreement with eli lilly and company, lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to our second oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor, baricitinib, for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. in january 2016, lilly submitted a new drug application (nda) to the fda and a marketing authorization application (maa) to the european medicines agency for baricitinib as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. in february 2017, we and lilly announced that the european commission approved baricitinib as olumiant for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. in july 2017, japan's ministry of health, labor and welfare granted marketing approval for olumiant for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with inadequate response to standard-of-care therapies. in june 2018, the fda approved the 2mg dose of olumiant for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapies.
since we began our drug-discovery and development activities in early 2002, we have filed numerous investigational new drug (ind) applications and progressed multiple internally developed proprietary compounds into clinical development. two new drug applications (ndas) seeking marketing approval for drug candidates discovered by incyte are currently under review by the fda; the nda for pemigatinib was submitted by incyte in september 2019 and the nda for capmatinib was submitted by novartis in december 2019.
license agreements and business relationships we establish business relationships, including collaborative arrangements with other companies and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our drugs and drug candidates and to provide support for our research programs. we also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies and medical research institutions.
below is a brief description of our significant business relationships and collaborations and related license agreements that expand our pipeline and provide us with certain rights to existing and potential new products and technologies.
novartis in november 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis. under the terms of the agreement, novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to jakafi (ruxolitinib) in the united states and in certain other indications. novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our met inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications. we retained options to co-develop and to co-promote capmatinib in the united states.
under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210.0 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $1.2 billion if defined development and
58
commercialization milestones are achieved. we are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties ranging from the upper-teens to the mid-twenties percent on future ruxolitinib net sales outside of the united states, and tiered, worldwide royalties on future capmatinib net sales that range from 12% to 14%. in addition, novartis has received reimbursement and pricing approval for ruxolitinib in a specified number of countries, and we are now obligated to pay to novartis tiered royalties in the low single-digits on future ruxolitinib net sales within the united states. each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. novartis is also responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of capmatinib.
in april 2016, we amended this agreement to provide that novartis has exclusive research, development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib (excluding topical formulations) in the gvhd field. under this amendment, we received a $5.0 million payment in exchange for the development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in gvhd outside of the united states and became eligible to receive up to $75.0 million of additional potential development and regulatory milestones relating to gvhd. in march 2017, we recognized a $25.0 million milestone for the first patient first visit in a gvhd study and in december 2017, we recognized a $40.0 million milestone for novartis achieving annual net sales of a jak licensed product of $600.0 million. in december 2018, we recognized a $60.0 million milestone for novartis achieving annual net sales of a jak licensed product of $900.0 million.
the novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. royalties are payable by novartis on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (iii) a specified period from first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by novartis or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis by novartis for convenience. the agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
lilly in december 2009, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with lilly. under the terms of the agreement, lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. we received an initial payment of $90.0 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665.0 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercialization milestones.
we retained options to co-develop our jak1/jak2 inhibitors with lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication basis. lilly is responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. if we elect to co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval, including post-launch studies required by a regulatory authority. we would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global net sales for compounds and/or indications that we elect to co-develop. for indications that we elect not to co-develop, we would receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global net sales with rates ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized. if we have started co-development funding for any indication, we can at any time opt out and stop future co-development cost sharing. if we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those indications for which we co-funded. we previously had retained an option to co-promote products in the united states but, in march 2016, we waived our co-promotion option as part of an amendment to the agreement.
in july 2010, we elected to co-develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis, and subsequently in several additional indications, and became responsible for funding 30% of the associated global development costs for such indications from the initiation of the phase iib trial through regulatory approval, including post-launch studies required by a regulatory authority. in april 2019, we elected to end additional co-funding of the development of baricitinib in all
59
indications, effective as of january 1, 2019. pursuant to the terms of the lilly agreement, we will continue to receive base tiered royalties on global net sales of olumiant in all indications, as well as pro-rated incremental royalties, as described above.
in march 2016, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with lilly that allows us to engage in the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in the gvhd field. upon execution of the amendment, we paid lilly an upfront payment of $35.0 million and lilly is eligible to receive up to $40.0 million in regulatory milestone payments relating to ruxolitinib in the gvhd field. in may 2019, the approval of jakafi in steroid-refractory acute gvhd triggered a $20.0 million milestone payment to lilly.
in february 2017, the european commission announced the approval of baricitinib as olumiant, triggering a $65.0 million milestone payment from lilly. in july 2017, japan's mhlw granted marketing approval for olumiant, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment from lilly. in december 2017, we recognized a $30.0 million milestone payment for the first patient treated in the atopic dermatitis phase iii program for baricitinib. in june 2018, the fda approved the 2mg dose of olumiant, triggering a $100.0 million milestone payment from lilly. in september 2018, we recognized a $20.0 million milestone payment for the first patient treated in the systemic lupus erythematosus phase iii program for baricitinib.
the lilly agreement will continue until lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. royalties are payable by lilly on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (iii) a specified period from first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by lilly or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated by lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
agenus in january 2015, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with agenus inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 4-antibody ag (now known as agenus switzerland inc.), which we collectively refer to as agenus. under this agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate on the discovery of novel immuno-therapeutics using agenus' antibody discovery platforms. in february 2017, we and agenus amended this agreement.
under the terms of this agreement, as amended, we received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to four checkpoint modulators directed against gitr, ox40, lag-3 and tim-3. in addition to the initial four program targets, we and agenus have the option to jointly nominate and pursue additional targets within the framework of the collaboration, and in november 2015, three more targets were added. targets may be designated profit-share programs, where all costs and profits are shared equally by us and agenus, or royalty-bearing programs, where we are responsible for all costs associated with discovery, preclinical, clinical development and commercialization activities. the programs relating to gitr and ox40 and two of the undisclosed targets were profit-share programs until february 2017, while the other targets currently under collaboration are royalty-bearing programs. the february 2017 amendment converted the programs relating to gitr and ox40 to royalty-bearing programs and removed from the collaboration the profit-share programs relating to the two undisclosed targets, with one reverting to us and one reverting to agenus. should any of those removed programs be successfully developed by a party, the other party will be eligible to receive the same milestone payments as the royalty-bearing programs and royalties at a 15% rate on global net sales. there are currently no profit-share programs. for each royalty-bearing product other than gitr and ox40, agenus will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from 6% to 12%. for gitr and ox40, agenus will be eligible to receive 15% royalties on global net sales. under the february 2017 amendment, we paid agenus $20.0 million in accelerated milestones relating to the clinical development of the gitr and ox40 programs. agenus is eligible to receive up to an additional $510.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory and commercialization milestones across all programs in the collaboration. the agreement may be terminated by us for convenience upon 12 months' notice and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition. we recognize revenue only when we have satisfied a performance obligation through transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer. control, in this instance, may mean the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and receiving benefit from, a good or service. the standard indicates that an entity must determine at contract inception whether it will transfer control of a promised good or service over time or satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time through analysis of the following criteria: (i) the entity has a present right to payment, (ii) the customer has legal title, (iii) the customer has physical possession, (iv) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) the customer has accepted the asset. we assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.
product revenues our product revenues consist of u.s. sales of jakafi and european sales of iclusig. product revenues are recognized once we satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time under the revenue recognition criteria as described above. we recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and government rebates, such as medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements in the u.s. these sales allowances and accruals are recorded based on estimates which are described in detail below. estimates are assessed as of the end of each reporting period and are updated to reflect current information. we believe that our sales allowances and accruals are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances.
customer credits: our customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. we expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.
64
rebates and discounts: we accrue rebates for mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program in the u.s. and mandated discounts in europe in markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. these accruals are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. our estimates for expected utilization of rebates are based on data received from our customers. rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters' unpaid rebates. if actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
chargebacks: chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain contracted customers purchase directly from our wholesalers at a discounted price. the wholesalers, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted price paid by the contracted customers. in addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for chargebacks based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. if actual future chargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
medicare part d coverage gap: medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund 70% of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. our estimates for the expected medicare part d coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our customers. funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. if actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
co-payment assistance: patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. we accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
product royalty revenues royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are estimated based on information provided by novartis. royalty revenues on commercial sales for olumiant by lilly are estimated based on information provided by lilly. we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. if actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust the prior period, which would affect royalty revenue and receivable in the period of adjustment.
milestone and contract revenues at the inception of the contract, the transaction price reflects the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to our collaborator. we review our estimate of the transaction price each period, and make revisions to such estimates as necessary. milestone and contract revenues from collaborative agreements with multiple performance obligations is determined based upon assessment of each distinct promised good or service's estimated fair value and recognized based upon the transfer of the promised good or service to our collaborator.
our license agreements often include contractual milestones, which typically relate to the achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events outside of our control, such as regulatory approval of a compound, first patient dosing or achievement of sales-based thresholds. as such, milestones associated with our collaborations involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received. given the uncertainty associated with achieving these milestones, a constraint on the allocated consideration is assessed each reporting period. revenues are recognized when achievement is probable, which may not be until achieved.
stock compensation. share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and performance shares (psus), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values at the date of grant as well as expected forfeiture rates based on actual
65
experience. the stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding black-scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of psus vesting. the fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of rsus that are subject to cliff vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method, and the fair value of rsus that are subject to graded vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of psus are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement. we assess the probability of achievement of performance conditions, including projected product revenues and clinical development milestones, as of the end of each reporting period. once a performance condition is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method for psus that are subject to cliff vesting and using the accelerated attribution method for psus that are subject to graded vesting.
income taxes. we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to financial accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. we periodically assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets to an amount that is considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realizable. our assessment considers recent cumulative earnings experience, projections of future taxable income (losses) and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  when performing our assessment on projections of future taxable income (losses), we consider factors such as the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success of products currently under development, among other factors. significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit that is recorded for these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included within the tax provision.
we record estimates and prepare and file tax returns in various jurisdictions across the u.s., europe, and asia based upon our interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. while we exercise significant judgment when applying complex tax laws and regulations in these various taxing jurisdictions, many of our tax returns are open to audit, and may be subject to future tax, interest, and penalty assessments.
we believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements are appropriate based upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above.
acquisition-related contingent consideration. acquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty and certain potential milestone obligations to ariad/takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using an income approach based on estimated iclusig revenues in the european union and other countries. as the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market, this represents a level 3 measurement.
the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration include projected iclusig revenues and discount rates which,
66
require significant judgement and are analyzed on a quarterly basis. while we use the best available information to prepare our projected iclusig revenues and discount rate assumptions, actual iclusig revenues and/or market conditions could differ significantly. changes to one or multiple inputs could have a material impact on the amount of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense recorded during the reporting period.

our product revenues, net for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, were $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. the increase in jakafi product revenues was comprised of a volume increase of $204.5 million and a price increase of $93.5 million. our product revenues may fluctuate from period to period due to our customers' purchasing patterns over the course of a year, including as a result of increased inventory building by customers in advance of expected or announced price increases. product revenues are recorded net of estimated product returns, pricing discounts including rebates offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and distribution fees and co-pay assistance. our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals:

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those
67
government related entities. we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future jakafi price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. we adjust our estimates for government rebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related sales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new information becomes available. we also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding actual returns as it becomes available.
we expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the medicare part d coverage gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors.
product royalty revenues on commercial sales of jakavi by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. product royalty revenues on commercial sales of olumiant by lilly are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by lilly.
our milestone and contract revenues were $77.5 million and $180.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2019, under the innovent agreement, we recognized a $40.0 million upfront payment and a $20.0 million milestone and under the zai lab agreement, we recognized a $17.5 million upfront payment. during the year ended december 31, 2018, under the lilly agreement, we recognized a $20.0 million development milestone for the first patient treated in systemic lupus erythematosus phase iii program for baricitinib and a $100.0 million regulatory milestone for the approval of the 2mg dose of olumiant for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients by the fda and under the novartis agreement, we recognized a $60.0 million milestone for novartis achieving annual net sales of a jak licensed product of $900.0 million.

total research and development expenses          $1,154.1             $1,198.0
we account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. salary and benefits related expense increased from 2018 to 2019 due primarily to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted, stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation.
the decrease in clinical research and outside services expense from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements and the election to end additional co-funding of the development of baricitinib with lilly effective as of january 1, 2019. research and development expenses include upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborative agreements of $27.8 million and $52.4 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. for the year ended 2019, we recorded no research and development expense under the lilly agreement for co-funding the development of baricitinib. for the year ended 2018, we recorded $68.6 million in research and development expenses under the lilly agreement representing 30% of the global development costs for baricitinib. research and development expenses for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 were net of $15.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners.
in addition to one-time expenses resulting from upfront fees in connection with the entry into any new or amended collaboration agreements and payment of milestones under those agreements, research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial related activities. many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. in addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.

total selling, general and administrative expenses       $468.7                $434.4
salary and benefits related expense increased from 2018 to 2019 due to increased headcount. this increased headcount was due primarily to the ongoing commercialization efforts related to jakafi for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, uncontrolled polycythemia vera and gvhd as well as increased headcount related to our european operations. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of awards granted,
69
stock price volatility and expected award lives, as well as expected award forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation.
change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration acquisition-related contingent consideration, which consists of our future royalty and certain potential milestone obligations to takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date, june 1, 2016, at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured quarterly. the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $19.7 million and $26.2 million, respectively. the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 was due primarily to the passage of time as there were no other significant changes in the key assumptions during the periods.

due to historical net losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion as of december 31, 2019. we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of convertible notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. at december 31, 2019, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.1 billion. our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts, corporate debt securities and u.s. government securities. available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.
cash provided by operating activities. the $374.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to our increased product revenues and changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities. our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and purchases of long term investments. during 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $87.5 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $374.8 million and capital expenditures of $78.1 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $365.4 million. during 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $86.4 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $159.9 million, capital expenditures of $73.5 million, and purchases of long term investments of $8.9 million, offset in part by the sale and maturity of marketable securities of $155.9 million.
cash provided by financing activities. during 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $45.7 million and $14.7 million, respectively, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans, offset in part by cash paid to ariad/takeda for contingent consideration.

in october 2019, we entered into an agreement with wilmington friends school inc., to purchase property for $50.0 million to expand our global headquarters. under that agreement, closing of the purchase is subject to certain standard closing conditions, including an initial diligence period and a subsequent approval period.
in january 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related purchase agreement with morphosys, under which we agreed to pay morphosys and upfront non-refundable payment of $750.0 million and to purchase american depositary shares (adss) representing ordinary shares of morphosys for an aggregate purchase price of $150.0 million. the effectiveness of the collaboration and license agreement is conditioned on the early termination or expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as well as clearance by the german and austrian antitrust authorities, and closing of the purchase of the adss is subject to customary conditions, as well as the effectiveness of the collaboration and license agreement.
we believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; costs for future facility requirements; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreements with novartis, lilly, innovent and zai lab; and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements, including our agreements with agenus, ariad/takeda, calithera, lilly, macrogenics, morphosys, merus and syros, strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. to the extent we seek to augment our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations to satisfy our cash requirements for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes, we expect that additional funding can be obtained through equity or debt financings or from other sources. the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above.

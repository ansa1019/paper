item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits, improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. in addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. finally, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel.
in february 2019 and may 2018, we initiated restructuring plans primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the "2019 footprint realignment plan" and the "2018 footprint realignment plan," respectively). the 2019 footprint realignment and the 2018 footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed during 2022 and 2024, respectively. for additional information on both of these plans and a discussion of our other ongoing restructuring programs, see "restructuring and impairment charges" under "results of operations" below.
disruption in sterilization services during the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31, 2019, operations at the smyrna, cobb county, georgia facility of one of our contract sterilizers, sterigenics u.s., llc, were suspended by state and local officials due to issues associated with the facility's use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations. the suspension of operations at the smyrna facility resulted in a disruption in supply with respect to some of our surgical, intermittent catheter and oem products. we utilized various measures to enable us to continue to provide the affected products to our customers, including alternate sterilization facilities, provisioning substitute products and instituting targeted global inventory management procedures. nevertheless, we estimate the adverse impact from the suspension of operations at sterigenics' smyrna facility adversely affected our 2019 revenues by approximately $7 million during the fourth quarter of 2019. while we have secured alternate sterilization facilities for the affected products, based on currently available information, we believe that the disruption in the supply of our product will adversely affect our 2020 revenues by $5 million to $7 million. our 2020 revenues may be further adversely affected if we experience any significant difficulties or delays in accessing the sterilization capacity at the alternate facilities. for additional information see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a. of this report.
u.s. tax legislation u.s. tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") was enacted on december 22, 2017. the legislation significantly changed u.s. tax law by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21%; implementing a territorial tax system, generally providing for, among other things, a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a non-u.s. corporation if specified conditions are met; and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of non-u.s. subsidiaries, which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax.
on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja. sab 118 states that in these circumstances, if we can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects, the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined (and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined). we included a provisional $107.9 million net tax expense related to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017.
during 2018, due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and in our assumptions, and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance, we made a $0.2 million adjustment to the provisional amount for taxes on deemed repatriated earnings and a $2.1 million adjustment related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. as prescribed under sab 118, these adjustments were identified and recorded as discrete adjustments in the period in which such changes were made. we completed our accounting for these provisional amounts during 2018 and we made no further adjustments to them during 2019.
health care reform in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. the legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed, but not adopted, in 2017. however, the tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act, which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage. as a result, the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to increased uncertainty. moreover, on december 14, 2018, the u.s. district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid, although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal. the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act, any court decision regarding the act's validity and, generally, the longer-term viability of the act, is uncertain.
global economic conditions global economic conditions in the past decade have had an adverse impact on market activities due to, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. while there generally has been some improvement in economic conditions recently, the degree of improvement has been uneven among our regional markets, and the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
in recent years, hospitals in some regions of the u.s. experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. despite recent improvements in the economic environment, challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 95% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. conversely, our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered, although, as noted above, the affordable care act may be subject to repeal, a final court determination of invalidity, further modification or replacement; therefore, the longer-term viability of the act is uncertain.
the economy in europe has weakened over the past year. europe has seen a slowdown in external demand and a contraction in manufacturing, which is starting to impact other parts of the economy. while the solid performance of the labor market has helped to sustain private consumption and domestic demand, gdp growth is expected to remain flat over the near term. the economy in europe is not likely to rebound in the near term as international trade in goods remains relatively stagnant and the risks of an increase in trade tensions, growing geopolitical conflicts and high uncertainties related to trade policies and the impact of brexit remain uncertain.
in asia, we believe the economic outlook for the healthcare sector generally is positive. however, an ongoing slowdown in the chinese economy and u.s. - china trade tensions, as well as the public health epidemic relating to the novel coronavirus (referred to as covid-19) reported to have originated in wuhan, china, have increased uncertainties within asia. in addition, we continue to confront government-implemented price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in australia, china and india. there continue to be government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. moreover, many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries.
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina, brazil and mexico have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in reduced spending on necessary medical supplies and creating delays in the importation of medical devices. although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and "existing products" are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors, either through acquisition or termination of the distributor, from the sales channel.
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2018 and 2017, refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 filed on february 21, 2019. discussion of our reportable segment results of operations comparison for 2018 and 2017 is included below within this annual report on form 10-k to reflect the changes in our segment presentation, which occurred during the first quarter of 2019.
comparison of 2019 and 2018
revenues
2019                                   2018                          2017
(dollars in millions)
net revenues            $2,595.4                      $2,448.4                      $2,146.3
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased 6.0%, or $147.0 million, compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily attributable to a $142.8 million increase in sales volumes of existing products and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new product sales, which were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $46.8 million.
gross profit
2019                                                                   2018                          2017
(dollars in millions)
gross profit                     $1,491.6                      $1,384.4                      $1,171.8
percentage of revenues               57.5   %                      56.5   %                      54.6   %
for the year ended december 31, 2019, gross margin increased 100 basis points, or 1.8%, compared to the prior year period. the increase was primarily attributable to favorable product mix, an increase in sales volumes of existing products and benefits from cost improvement initiatives partially offset by incremental tariffs and higher logistics and distribution costs.
selling, general and administrative
2019                                                                           2018                        2017
(dollars in millions)
selling, general and administrative          $934.4                      $878.7                      $700.0
percentage of revenues                         36.0   %                    35.9   %                    32.6   %
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $55.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses incurred to support higher sales and expenses incurred by our acquired businesses. the increases were partially offset by favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
research and development
2019                                                                  2018                      2017
(dollars in millions)
research and development            $113.9                      $106.2                     $84.8
percentage of revenues                 4.4   %                     4.3   %                   3.9   %
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to new product development costs for several of our product lines and european union medical device regulation ("eu mdr") related costs.
restructuring and impairment charges anticipated charges and pre-tax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives we have ongoing restructuring programs primarily related to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations (referred to as our 2019, 2018 and 2014 footprint realignment plans). we also have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment (the "oem initiative") that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance; nevertheless, the activities should result in cost savings (we expect only minimal costs to be incurred in connection with the oem initiative). with respect to our currently ongoing restructuring programs and the oem initiative, the table below summarizes charges incurred or estimated to be incurred and estimated annual pre-tax savings to be realized as follows: (1) with respect to charges (a) the estimated total charges that will have been incurred once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed; (b) the charges incurred through december 31, 2019; and (c) the estimated charges to be incurred from january 1, 2020 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and oem initiative, december 31, 2026 and (2) with respect to estimated annual pre-tax savings, (a) the estimated total annual pre-tax savings to be realized once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed; (b) the estimated annual pre-tax savings realized based on the progress of the restructuring programs and oem initiative through december 31, 2019; and (c) the estimated additional annual pre-tax savings to be realized from january 1, 2020 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative, december 31, 2026.
estimated charges and pre-tax savings are subject to change based on, among other things, the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities, changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative, unanticipated expenditures and other developments, the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions, the failure to realize anticipated savings from a supply contract related to a component included in certain kits sold by our americas segment and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pre-tax savings. moreover, estimated pre-tax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve, among other things, assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management, which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty. it is likely that estimates of charges and pre-tax savings will change from time to time, and the table below may reflect changes from amounts previously estimated. in addition, the table below does not include estimated charges and pre-tax savings related to substantially completed programs such as the 2017 vascular solutions integration program, the 2017 emea program, the 2016 footprint realignment plan and other 2016 restructuring programs, which were substantially completed prior to or during 2019. additional details, including estimated charges expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring programs, are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
pre-tax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations; such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pre-tax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations. for example, an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses, although likely to increase manufacturing costs, may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated.
restructuring programs and other similar cost saving initiatives estimated total                                      through                              estimated remaining from january 1, 2020 through december 31, 2019                                                             december 31, 2026

total pre-tax savings                         $69 - $80                                          $26                                                          $43 - $54
(1)restructuring related charges represent costs that are directly related to the programs and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to the new locations, project management costs and accelerated depreciation, as well as a charge associated with our exit from facilities that is expected to be imposed by the taxing authority in the affected jurisdiction. most of these changes (other than the tax charge) are expected to be recognized in cost of goods sold.
(2)substantially all of the pre-tax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold.
the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our ongoing significant restructuring programs:
2019 footprint realignment plan in february 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the "2019 footprint realignment plan"). these actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2022.
we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2019 footprint realignment plan of $56 million to $70 million, of which we estimate that $53 million to $66 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur $29 million to $35 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, most of which we expect to be incurred by the end of 2021.
we expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2021 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $12 million to $14 million once the plan is fully implemented.
2018 footprint realignment plan in may 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain european manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and related workforce reductions. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2018 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.
we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2018 footprint realignment plan of $102 million to $133 million, of which, we estimate that $99 million to $127 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur $19 million to $23 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, most of which we expect to be incurred by the end of 2021.
we began realizing plan-related savings in 2018 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $25 million to $30 million once the plan is fully implemented.
2014 footprint realignment plan in april 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan (the "2014 footprint realignment plan") involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 footprint realignment plan of $47 million to $52 million. additionally, we estimate that we will achieve annual pre-tax savings of $26 million to $29 million and we expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021.
the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits.

(2)impairment charges recognized in 2019 and 2018 included $7.0 million and $17.2 million, respectively, related to our decision to abandon certain intellectual property and other assets associated with products that were eliminated from our interventional product portfolio.
interest expense

taxes on income from continuing operations
2019                                                         2018               2017
effective income tax rate           (35.9)   %           10.6   %           45.5   %
we generate substantial earnings from our non-u.s. operations. most of the non-u.s. jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had statutory tax rates that are lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate; as a result, our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2019 and earlier years (excluding the one-time impacts of the tcja) has been substantially below the u.s. statutory tax rate. the principal non-u.s. jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2019 and earlier years was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings included ireland and bermuda.
comparison of 2019 and 2018
the effective income tax rate for 2019 was (35.9)% compared to 10.6% for 2018. taxes (benefit) on income from continuing operations in 2019 were ($122.1) million compared to $23.2 million in 2018. the effective income tax rate for 2019 reflected a tax benefit of $129 million resulting from a non-u.s. legal entity restructuring that eliminated the requirement to provide for withholding taxes on the future repatriation of certain non-permanently reinvested earnings. additionally, the effective tax rate for 2019 was affected by a tax benefit relating to the revaluation of state deferred tax assets and liabilities due to business integrations and other changes. the effective tax rates for both 2019 and 2018 reflect a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a tax cost associated with a non-deductible contingent consideration expense recognized in connection with an increase in the fair value of the neotract contingent consideration liability. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the credit agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
of our $301.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019, $231.4 million was held at non-u.s. subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.
on november 15, 2019, we prepaid $250 million aggregate principle amount of our 2024 notes using available borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
we have entered into cross-currency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate. under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged in the aggregate $750 million for €653.1 million. the swap agreements, which begin to expire in october 2023, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements. we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. as a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination dates, between the u.s. dollar equivalent of the €653.1 million notional amount and the $750 million notional amount. if, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or declined by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements, we would receive from or be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately $75 million in respect of the notional settlement. the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. however, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions.
on february 18, 2020, we acquired iwg high performance conductors, inc., a privately-held original equipment manufacturer of minimally invasive medical products and high performance conductors, for $260 million. the acquisition, which will complement our oem product portfolio, was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.
see "financing arrangements" below as well as note 10 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our borrowings and financial instruments.

comparison of 2019 and 2018
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $437.1 million during 2019 and $435.1 million during 2018. the $2.0 million increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in working capital and contingent consideration payments of $26.1 million. the unfavorable change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to timing of collections and higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2019 and an increase in inventory purchases required to achieve desired safety stock levels and to support ongoing business growth.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $73.5 million during 2019, which included capital expenditures of $102.7 million partially offset by proceeds from cross-currency swap agreements designated as net investment hedges of $18.3 million and proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of $14.3 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was $418.8 million during 2019, which reflected a net decrease in borrowings of $253.5 million, contingent consideration payments of $112.1 million and dividend payments of $62.8 million.

senior credit facility on april 5, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), which provides for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $700 million term loan facility, each of which matures on april 5, 2024. the credit agreement replaces a previous credit agreement under which we were provided a $1.0 billion credit facility and a $750 million term loan facility, due 2022 (the "prior term loan"). the $700 million term loan facility under the credit agreement principally was applied against the remaining $675 million principal balance of the prior term loan.
at our option, loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or at an alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (i) the "prime rate" in the u.s. last quoted by the wall street journal, (ii) 0.50% above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar borrowings and (iii) 1.00% above adjusted libor for a one month interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 1.00%, in each case subject to adjustments based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio (generally, consolidated total funded indebtedness (which is net of "qualified cash"), as defined in the credit agreement, on the date of determination to consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination). overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 2.00%.
at december 31, 2019, we had $300.0 million in borrowings outstanding and $2.1 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
the credit agreement contains covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness; create additional liens; enter into a merger, consolidation or amalgamation or other defined "fundamental changes," dispose of certain assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, pay dividends, or make other restricted payments, enter into swap agreements or enter into transactions with our affiliates. additionally, the credit agreement contains financial covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, require us to maintain a consolidated total net leverage ratio of not more than 4.50 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, consolidated ebitda for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination to consolidated interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement, paid in cash for such period) of not less than 3.50 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement.
see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the credit agreement.
2026 and 2027 senior notes as of december 31, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 notes") and 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes" and collectively, the "senior notes") was $400.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. the indentures governing the 2026 notes contain covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock or other disqualified stock, create liens, merge, consolidate, or dispose of certain assets pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments, or enter into transactions with our affiliates. the indenture governing the 2027 notes contains covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes.
accounts receivable securitization we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2019, and 2018 we borrowed the maximum amount available of $50.0 million under this facility. this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred.

(1)interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december 31, 2019.
(2)purchase and other obligations are defined as unconditional commitments to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: quantities to be purchased; price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures (which, at the time we entered into the commitments, did not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business) and penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements; the amounts exclude operating lease obligations, which are addressed elsewhere in the table.
(3)as permitted by the tcja, we have elected to pay the tax in annual installments over eight years.
our noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions was $10.3 million and $10.7 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made; as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
our contingent consideration liabilities were $219.9 million and $304.2 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of which $148.1 million and $136.9 million, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration. we expect most of the current portion to be paid during the first quarter 2020 as result of the achievement of certain sales milestones. due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
see note 12, note 15 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable, after considering our historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.1 million and $9.3 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which constituted 2.1% and 2.4% of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other, unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. when necessary, we adjust the reserves, with a corresponding adjustment to revenue, to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $21.6 million and $18.1 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31, 2019 within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
we review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.
long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. for example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("ipr&d")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights and non-competition agreements) and are, generally, obtained through acquisition. intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill.
the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses, including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic conditions and estimating future cash flows. assumptions we use in our acquisition date fair value estimates and in our impairment evaluations include the discount rate and forecasted growth rates, which are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans, when applicable. we believe these assumptions and estimates are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. during 2019, in conjunction with our segment change, we determined it appropriate to aggregate certain north american reporting units because they were economically similar and as a result, we have six reporting units. no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019.
in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below test, described below. alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the two-step quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2019 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. moreover, changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and the quantitative impairment tests, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names and ipr&d is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the value of the hypothetical royalty, which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. management must estimate the volume of sales, hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset.  discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace.
during the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $7.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively, related to our decision to abandon certain intellectual property intangible assets. see "restructuring and impairment charges" within "result of operations" above as well as note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on these charges.
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate                                                                                                         expected return on plan assets   assumed healthcare trend rate

projected benefit obligation                                      $(29.7)                                      $32.9                                        n/a                                              $1.9                $(1.7)
for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on u.s. treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. share based compensation expense for 2019 and 2018 was $26.9 million and $22.4 million, respectively.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the neotract and essential medical acquisitions which represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31, 2019 and 2018, using a monte carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using other probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration. increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases may have the opposite effect. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities' fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we accrued $219.9 million and $304.2 million of contingent consideration, respectively.
income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the difficulties inherent in such assessments, judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions. as a result, we are at times subject to tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final u.s. and non-u.s. tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $119.2 million and $144.0 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and non-u.s. tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination in germany. the ultimate outcome of this examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.
as noted above, the tcja significantly changed u.s. tax law. as a result of the enactment of the tcja, our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended december 31, 2017, included provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2018, as permitted by sab 118, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the tcja included in our december 31, 2017 financial statements. for the year ended december 31, 2019, we made no adjustments to the provisional amounts. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements.

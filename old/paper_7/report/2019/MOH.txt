management's discussion and analysis of the changes in the individual components of medical margin is presented below under "financial performance."
see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 18, "segments," for more information.
health plans the health plans segment consists of health plans operating in 14 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico.

as of december 31, 2019, these health plans served approximately 3.3 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored health care programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies.
trends and uncertainties for a discussion of health plans segment's trends, uncertainties and other developments, refer to "item 1. business-our business," and "-legislative and political environment."

______________________
(1)   in 2019, "other" includes the new mexico health plan. the new mexico health plan's medicaid contract terminated on december 31, 2018, and therefore its 2019 results are not individually significant to our consolidated operating results.
(2)   "other" includes the idaho, mississippi, new york, utah and wisconsin health plans, whose results are not individually significant to our consolidated operating results.
health plan performance in summary, we believe our health plan portfolio continued to perform well in 2019, despite headwinds from lower membership from contract losses in florida and new mexico, and cost pressures in certain medicaid markets. comments relating to california, ohio, texas and washington, our largest health plans from a premium revenue standpoint, follow:
our california health plan continues to perform well in its diversified book of business in one of the more complex network environments in the country, and the mcr is performing in the low 80s as a result of a stable premium rate environment and effective medical cost management. medical margin in 2018 was unfavorably impacted by the $81 million reduction in premium revenue relating to retroactive california medicaid expansion risk corridor adjustments.
in ohio, we have meaningful market share at approximately 12%, and are generating solid medical margins. however, the medical margin decreased and the mcr increased in 2019 due to higher medical care costs from the carve in of the behavioral health benefit and a higher acuity mix of members due to redetermination efforts by the state. we expect that these higher medical care costs will eventually be factored into future premium rate considerations by the state.
our texas health plan experienced a decline in both premium revenues and medical margin in 2019, due to the overall decline in marketplace membership, and a higher marketplace mcr due to higher medical care costs.

improved mcr. the mcr improved, despite some pressure in medical costs, due to the increased focus on medical care management.

medicaid program medicaid premium revenue decreased $1,157 million in 2019, mainly due to membership losses resulting from the termination of our medicaid contracts in new mexico and in all but two regions in florida in late 2018 and early 2019, respectively, partially offset by net rate increases in certain other markets.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $132 million, or 10%, in 2019 when compared with 2018, despite the decrease in premium revenues. the increase was due to improvement in the overall medicaid mcr, which more than offset the impact of lower premium revenue.
the medicaid mcr decreased to 88.0% in 2019, from 90.0% in 2018, or 200 basis points. the decrease in the medicaid mcr in 2019 was due to improvements across all programs. the mcr for tanf and chip improved due to pmpm premium revenue increases. the improved mcr for the abd program was principally driven by increases in premium revenue pmpm, lower pharmacy costs from re-contracted pharmacy benefits management, and our continued focus on medical cost management.
the decrease in the medicaid expansion mcr in 2019, when compared with 2018, was mainly due to the impact of the $81 million reduction in premium revenue recognized in 2018, relating to retroactive california medicaid expansion risk corridor adjustments.
medicare program medicare premium revenue increased by $169 million in 2019, primarily due to an 8% increase in premium revenue pmpm. pmpms improved due to increased revenue resulting from risk scores that are more commensurate with the acuity of our population. member months were essentially flat in 2019 compared to 2018.
the medical margin for medicare increased $8 million, or 2%, in 2019 when compared with 2018, primarily due to the increase in premium revenue discussed above.
the medicare mcr increase was primarily due to the increase in medical care costs pmpm, which was partially offset by the increase in the premium revenue pmpm discussed above. the increase in medical care costs pmpm is mainly attributed to fluctuations of medical care costs in certain markets.
marketplace program marketplace premium revenue decreased $416 million in 2019, driven by lower membership, partially offset by premium rate increases and increased premiums tied to risk scores. marketplace membership declined from 362,000 at december 31, 2018, to 274,000 at december 31, 2019. additionally, the decrease in premiums in 2019 reflects a relatively smaller benefit from prior year marketplace risk adjustment settlements in 2019, when compared with 2018.
the marketplace medical margin decreased $312 million in 2019, when compared with 2018, primarily due to a decrease in premium revenues, and the increase in the marketplace mcr. additionally, the decrease in medical margin in 2019 was partially driven by the impact of the $81 million csr reimbursement recognized in 2018. the csr benefit related to 2017 dates of service and was recognized following the federal government's confirmation that the reconciliation would be performed on an annual basis. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we had assumed a nine-month reconciliation of this item pending confirmation of the time period to which the 2017 reconciliation would be applied.

the marketplace mcr increased 930 basis points in 2019, which is mainly attributable to the impact of the $81 million csr reimbursement recognized in 2018, and the relatively smaller benefit from prior year marketplace risk adjustment settlements in 2019, when compared with 2018, as discussed above.
other the other segment includes the historical results of the mmis and behavioral health subsidiaries we sold in late 2018, as well as certain corporate amounts not allocated to the health plans segment. beginning in 2019, we no longer report service revenue or cost of service revenue as a result of the sales of the mmis and behavioral health subsidiaries noted above. in 2019 and 2018, the other segment margin was insignificant to our consolidated results of operations.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company. our regulated health plan subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related health care services. the majority of the assets held by our regulated health plan subsidiaries is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $1,373 million in 2019, and $288 million in 2018. the parent company contributed capital of $43 million and $145 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory net worth requirements.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $997 million and $170 million as of december 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the increase in 2019 was mainly due to the dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries, as described above, and proceeds from borrowings under the term loan facility. these cash inflows were partially offset by principal repayments of our outstanding 1.125% convertible notes and common stock purchases, as described further below in "cash flow activities."
investments we generally invest cash of our regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are purchased pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than 10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.

cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

net cash used in financing activities                                                 (552    )        (1,193      )    641
net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents     $(418    )        $(364       )         $(54        )
operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government agencies may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government agencies may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $427 million in 2019, compared with $314 million of net cash used in 2018. the $741 million increase in cash flow was mainly due to the impact of timing of premium receipts and settlements with government agencies, the latter being primarily related to the final 2017 csr settlement paid in 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $293 million in 2019, compared with $1,143 million of net cash provided in 2018, a decrease in cash flow of $1,436 million. the year over year decline was primarily due to increased purchases of investments, net of lower proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, in the year ended december 31, 2019.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $552 million in 2019, compared with $1,193 million in 2018. in 2019, net cash paid for the aggregate 1.125% convertible notes-related transactions amounted to $730 million, and we paid $47 million for common stock purchases, partially offset by proceeds of $220 million borrowed under the term loan facility. in 2018, net cash used in financing activities included net cash paid for the aggregate 1.125% convertible notes-related transactions of $837 million, a $300 million repayment of the credit facility, and $64 million repayment of the 1.625% convertible notes.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2019, our working capital was $2,698 million compared with $2,216 million as of december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2019, our cash and investments amounted to $4,477 million, compared with $4,629 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2018.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity" discussion presented earlier in this section of the md&a.

compared with $1,040 million at december 31, 2018. our hmo subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our hmo subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2019, is approximately $41 million in the aggregate. our hmo subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
debt ratings our 5.375% notes and 4.875% notes are rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "b2" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants our credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios, presented below, are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
credit agreement financial covenants   required per agreement   as of december 31, 2019
net leverage ratio                     &lt;4.0x                                    1.0x interest coverage ratio                &gt;3.5x                                   14.5x in addition, the indentures governing the 4.875% notes, the 5.375% notes, and the 1.125% convertible notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding notes.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our health plans segment regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which we generally receive a short time before we pay for the related health care services. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 17, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 20, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2019, we had available borrowing capacity of $380 million under the term loan facility, following our draw down of $220 million in the first half of 2019. under the term loan facility, we may request up to ten advances, each in a minimum principal amount of $50 million, until july 31, 2020. in addition, we have available borrowing capacity of $499 million under our credit facility. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
savings from the it restructuring plan. management's margin recovery plan identified and implemented various profit improvement initiatives. this included the plan to restructure our information technology department (the "it restructuring plan") in 2018, which is reported in the other segment. in connection with this plan, in early 2019, we entered into services agreements with an outsourcing vendor who manages certain of our information technology services. the it restructuring plan is substantially complete. we reduced annualized run-rate expenses by approximately $14 million in 2019, and expect to reduce such expenses by approximately $25 million to $30 million by the end of the fifth full year of the contract. such savings, when achieved, reduce other segment general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. further details of the restructuring plans, including costs associated with such plans, are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "restructuring costs."

future uses common stock purchases. in early december 2019, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program is funded by existing cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2021. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management, based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law.
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14, "stockholders' equity," pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we purchased approximately 400,000 shares of our common stock for $54 million in december 2019 (average cost of $135.30 per share), including approximately 55,000 shares purchased for $7 million in late december 2019, and settled in early january 2020. in january 2020 through february 7, 2020, we purchased 1,533,000 shares for $203 million (average cost of 132.69 per share).
acquisitions. our strategic focus has shifted to a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority.  in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted inorganic growth opportunities that provide a strategic fit, leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. this will include "bolt-on" membership opportunities in our current states and health plans in new states. as noted below, we entered into two acquisition agreements in the fourth quarter of 2019, pursuant to which we expect to add medicaid membership in illinois and new york in 2020.
on december 31, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase nextlevel health partners, inc., a medicaid managed care organization. upon the closing of this transaction, expected to occur in the first half of 2020, we will assume the right to serve approximately 50,000 medicaid and managed long-term services and supports members in cook county, illinois. the purchase price of approximately $50 million will be funded with available cash, and the closing is subject to customary closing conditions.
in october 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of yourcare health plan, inc. upon the closing of this transaction, expected to occur in the first half of 2020, we will serve approximately 46,000 medicaid members in seven counties in western new york. the purchase price of approximately $40 million will be funded with available cash, and the closing is subject to customary closing conditions.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
1.125% convertible notes. on january 15, 2020, we repaid the 1.125% convertible notes for $39 million, which amount reflected final settlement of both the principal amount outstanding and the 1.125% conversion option. refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt," for a detailed discussion of our convertible notes, including recent transactions.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material. our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
•   medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
•   contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."

medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability.
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics, and other relevant factors.

actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior periods" in the table presented in note , "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current period" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2019 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2019, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.

contractual obligations in the table below, we present our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019. some of the amounts included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments. we are not a party to off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation. specifically, our health plans try to control medical care costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services. through these contracted providers, our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. there can be no assurance, however, that our strategies to mitigate medical care cost inflation will be successful. competitive pressures, new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare providers and customers, applicable regulations, or other factors may affect our ability to control medical care costs.

compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies. regulation of managed care products and healthcare services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently. compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems, procedures and programs that we have not yet identified.

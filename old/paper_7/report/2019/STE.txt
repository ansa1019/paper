item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•   what factors affect our business;
•   what our earnings and costs were;
•   why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•   where our earnings came from;
•   how this affects our overall financial condition;
•   what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•   where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business," item 6, "selected financial data," and our consolidated financial statements, which present the results of our operations for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 as well as part i, item 1a, "risk factors" and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
information on our financial condition and results of our operations for our 2018 fiscal year period can be found in item 7 titled, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations", of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2019, filed with the sec on may 30, 2019.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•   backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•   debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•   days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."
22
revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•   revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•   product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•   service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our applied sterilization technologies segment.
•   capital equipment revenues - we define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, including system 1 and 1e, washing systems, vhp® technology, water stills, and pure steam generators; surgical lights and tables; and integrated or.
•   consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes system 1 and 1e consumables, v-pro consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, skin care products, cleaning consumables, barrier product solutions and surgical instruments.
•   recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary steris plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. our mission is to help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("gi") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room ("or") integration.
on march 28, 2019, steris plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales ("steris uk"), completed a redomiciliation from the united kingdom to ireland (the "redomiciliation"). the redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new irish public limited holding company ("steris ireland") on top of steris uk pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under english law (the "scheme"). following the scheme effectiveness, steris uk was re-registered as a private limited company with the name steris limited, and steris emerald ie limited, a company established in ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of steris ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of steris uk.
we operate and report in four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies. we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "business segment information."
the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. the covid-19 pandemic is resulting in the deferral of certain elective medical procedures, which is negatively impacting the demand for some of our products and services.
we completed several tuck in acquisitions and asset purchases in fiscal 2020 and 2019 that expanded our product and service offerings to our customers.
23
during fiscal 2020, we sold the operations of our healthcare specialty services business that were located in china with annual revenues of approximately $5.0 million.
we continue to invest in manufacturing in-sourcing projects and lean process improvements for the purpose of improving quality, cost and delivery of our products to our customers.
u.s. tax reform. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja"). the tcja made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax ("amt"); (3) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat"), a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from non-u.s. subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ("ftcs") and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the u.s. income tax liability; and (10) limitations on net operating losses ("nols") generated after december 31, 2017, to 80.0 percent of taxable income.
fiscal 2019 restructuring plan. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2019 restructuring plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in brazil and one in england, as well as other actions including, the rationalization of certain products. fewer than 200 positions were eliminated. the company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. these restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency. for additional information on restructuring see the subsection titled "restructuring expenses", located in the results of operations section of this md&a, or note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, titled "restructuring".
highlights.  revenues increased $248.7 million, or 8.9%, to $3,030.9 million for the year ended march 31, 2020, as compared to $2,782.2 million for the year ended march 31, 2019. this increase reflects organic growth in all business segments, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.
fiscal 2020 operating income increased 30.5% to $537.0 million over fiscal 2019 operating income of $411.5 million. the increase is primarily attributable to lower restructuring expenses, increased revenue volumes and higher gross margin attainment in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019.
net cash flows from operations were $590.6 million and free cash flow was $380.2 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net cash flows from operations of $539.5 million and free cash flow of $355.4 million in fiscal 2019 (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures). the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to the improvement in cash from operations.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 25.3% at march 31, 2020. during the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the fourteenth consecutive year to $0.37 per share per quarter.
outlook. in fiscal 2021 and beyond, we expect to continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services.
however, the covid-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020. the coronavirus pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid-19, including deferral of medical procedures and treatments and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures, is negatively affecting, and is expected to continue to affect some of our operations which would impact our financial position and cash flows in fiscal 2021. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services, including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand.
we cannot predict the ultimate impact that the covid-19 pandemic and related actions will have on our customers' operations, financial position and cash flows and therefore, on the demand for our products and services.
further, the broader economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic response could cause interest rate variability and generate unanticipated fluctuations in currency rates that impact our revenues and costs outside of the united states, creating variability in our results.
as a result, we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows for fiscal 2021 and beyond.
24
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2020 and 2019:

results of operations the covid-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020 and therefore did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2020 results of operations.
in the following subsections, we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them. we begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments.

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 7.0% in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019. volume sensitive costs like commissions and third party purchasing organization fees increased 15% in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019, but continue to be approximately 3% of revenues. higher compensation costs related to our annual employee bonus and additional operating expenses from our newly acquired businesses also contributed to the fiscal 2020 increase.
research and development. research and development expenses increased $2.5 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to increased spending within the healthcare products segment. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2020, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2019 restructuring plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in brazil and one in england, as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products. fewer than 200 positions were eliminated. the company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. these restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency.
we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $43.9 million related to these restructuring actions, of which $31.7 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $12.2 million was recorded in cost of revenues, with a total of $31.2 million, $2.5 million, $0.7 million, and $7.8 million related to the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies segments, respectively. corporate related restructuring charges were $1.7 million. additional restructuring expenses related to this plan are not expected to be material to our results of operations.

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 18.2% as compared to 17.4% for fiscal 2019. the fiscal 2020 effective tax rate increased when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increased percentage of profits earned and taxed in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate.

healthcare products revenues increased 6.3% in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting growth in consumable, service and capital equipment revenues of 9.5%, 6.1% and 4.2%, respectively. the increase reflects organic growth, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies. at march 31, 2020, the healthcare products segment's backlog amounted to $170.1 million, increasing $15.6 million, or 10.1%, as compared to the backlog of $154.5 million at march 31, 2019.
healthcare specialty services revenues increased 10.5% in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. the increase reflects organic growth, which was partially offset by the divestiture of our healthcare specialty services business in china and unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.
life sciences revenues increased 10.1% in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting growth in consumable, capital equipment and service revenues of 14.9%, 9.8% and 3.7%, respectively.  the increase reflects organic growth and favorable pricing, which were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies. life sciences backlog at march 31, 2020 amounted to $72.4 million, increasing $11.7 million, or 19.3%, as compared to backlog of $60.7 million at march 31, 2019.
applied sterilization technologies revenues increased 13.0% in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. the increase reflects organic growth, which was primarily attributable to increased demand from medical device customers, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.

the healthcare products segment's operating income increased $32.7 million to $356.4 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to $323.7 million in fiscal year 2019. the segment's operating margins were 25.0% for fiscal year 2020 and 24.2% for fiscal year 2019. the increases in the fiscal 2020 period were primarily due to increased volumes and favorable product mix.
the healthcare specialty services segment's operating income was flat at $64.2 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. the segment's operating margins were 11.4% for fiscal year 2020 and 12.6% for fiscal year 2019. the fiscal 2020 operating margin benefited from increased volumes, which were more than offset by investments being made to add capacity in anticipation of continuing demand.
the life sciences business segment's operating income increased $12.0 million to $144.1 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to $132.1 million in fiscal year 2019, primarily due to increased volumes. the segment's operating margins were 34.6% for fiscal year 2020 and 34.9% for fiscal year 2019. the decline in the fiscal 2020 operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable product mix.
the applied sterilization technologies segment's operating income increased $49.1 million to $270.9 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to $221.8 million in fiscal year 2019. the applied sterilization technologies segment's operating margins were 43.2% for fiscal year 2020 and 40.0% for fiscal year 2019. the increases in the fiscal 2020 period were primarily due to increased volumes.
effective april 1, 2020, and consistent with the way management will operate and view the business, the current healthcare products and healthcare specialty services segments will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called healthcare. going forward we will operate and report in three business segments: healthcare, life sciences and applied sterilization technologies. corporate will continue to be presented separately and contain the costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company and certain other corporate costs.

cash flow measures. free cash flow was $380.2 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $355.4 million in fiscal 2019. the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to the improvement in cash from operations.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 25.3% at march 31, 2020 and 27.1% at march 31, 2019.
cash requirements. we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our customers' acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.

•   on may 15, 2015, steris corporation issued and sold $350.0 million of senior notes, in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. these notes have maturities of 10 to 15 years from the issue date. the agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   the agreements governing certain senior notes issued and sold in february 2013, december 2012, and august 2008, were amended and restated in their entirety on march 31, 2015. all of these notes were issued and sold in private placements to certain institutional investors in offerings that were exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the amended and restated agreements, which have been consolidated into a single agreement for the 2013 and 2012 notes, and a separate single agreement for the 2008 notes, contain leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   all of the note agreements were amended in march 2019, in connection with the redomiciliation. the amendments waived certain repurchase rights of the note holders and increased the size of certain baskets to more closely align with credit agreement baskets.
as of march 31, 2020, a total of $275.4 million was outstanding under the credit agreement, based on currency exchange rates as of march 31, 2020. at march 31, 2020, we had $717.8 million of unused funding available under the credit agreement. the credit agreement includes a sub-limit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding. at march 31, 2020, there was $6.8 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement.
at march 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. we provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources" in the subsection titled, "contractual and commercial commitments" and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt."
capital expenditures our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. this program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. during fiscal 2020, our capital expenditures amounted to $214.5 million. we use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. in fiscal 2021, we expect to continue to invest in facility expansions, particularly within the applied sterilization technologies segment and in ongoing maintenance for existing facilities. the outbreak of covid-19 has become a global pandemic. we may choose to temporarily defer planned capital expenditures due to fluctuations in demand for our products and services resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and our customers' needs.
contractual and commercial commitments at march 31, 2020, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases totaling $173.9 million.
33
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31, 2020 are presented in the following tables. commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments.

critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
34
revenue recognition.  revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer. revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues. the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues. revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from customers.
we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets.
in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. at march 31, 2020 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers. we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer's inability to pay. as a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. these analyses require judgment. if the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
allowance for sales returns.  we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience.
inventories and reserves.  inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value. we determine cost based upon a combination of the last-in, first-out ("lifo") and first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost methods. we determine the lifo inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. for inventories valued using the lifo method, we believe that the use of the lifo method results in a matching of current costs and revenues. inventories valued using the lifo method represented approximately 25.3% and 25.2% of total inventories at march 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead. if we had used only the fifo method of inventory costing, inventories would have been $16.9 million and $16.8 million higher than those reported at march 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
we review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
35
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
asset retirement obligations. we incur retirement obligations for certain assets. we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations (aro) at fair value. accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "property, plant and equipment."
restructuring.  we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, and contractual obligations. actual amounts could differ from the original estimates. we review our restructuring-related accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2020 no indicators of impairment were identified.
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists. during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment. as a result, management recorded an impairment charge of $16.2 million, which is included within the selling, general, and administrative line of the consolidated statements of income. the remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach (the relief from royalty method). the remaining fair value was not material and was amortized over the asset's remaining useful life. fair value calculated using this approach is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
36
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2020 and 2019 was $23.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of
37
proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.

benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.
employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2020 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

we develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2020 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $10.5 million at march 31, 2020.

we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 6.8% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2020:

we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.
share-based compensation.  we measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. we selected the black-scholes-merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
share-based compensation expense was $23.8 million in fiscal 2020, $24.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $22.2 million in fiscal 2018. note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "share-based compensation," contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.
recently issued accounting standards impacting the company recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
inflation our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. we monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. however, we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation.

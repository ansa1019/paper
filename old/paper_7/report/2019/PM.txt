item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states. in addition, we ship a version of our platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") to altria group, inc., for sale in the united states under license. we are building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke.  through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. our iqos smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heat-not-burn tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.
we manage our business in six operating segments:
•   european union ("eu");
•   eastern europe ("ee");
•   middle east &amp; africa ("me&amp;a"), which includes our international duty free business;
•   south &amp; southeast asia ("s&amp;sa");
•   east asia &amp; australia ("ea&amp;a"); and
•   latin america &amp; canada ("la&amp;c"), which includes transactions under license with altria group, inc. for the distribution of our platform 1 product in the united states.
our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps"). rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking.
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).
our cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of the iqos devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. estimated costs associated with iqos warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.

executive summary the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
consolidated operating results
•   net revenues - net revenues of $29.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, increased by $0.2 billion, or 0.6%, from the comparable 2018 amount. the change in our net revenues from the comparable 2018 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale with year-to-date results):
net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 3.8%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, notably in germany, indonesia, japan, the philippines and turkey; and favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by heated tobacco unit and iqos device volume in the eu and russia, and heated tobacco unit volume in japan, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of cigarettes, notably in australia, the eu, indonesia, japan and russia, unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in pmi duty free, and unfavorable iqos device volume in japan and korea. the currency-neutral growth in net revenues of 3.8% came despite the unfavorable impact of $763 million, shown in "other" above, predominantly resulting from the deconsolidation of our canadian subsidiary, rothmans, benson & hedges, inc. ("rbh"), effective march 22, 2019. for further details on the deconsolidation of rbh, see item 8, note 18. contingencies and note 22. deconsolidation of rbh.

income taxes - the 2018 tax items that decreased our 2018 diluted eps by $0.02 per share in the table above represented a current income tax charge of $185 million primarily due to an increase in our final 2017 transition tax liability, mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of $154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york.
the 2019 tax items that increased our 2019 diluted eps by $0.04 per share in the table above was primarily due to a reduction in estimated u.s. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015-2018 ($67 million).
the change in the tax rate that decreased our diluted eps by $0.04 per share in the table above was primarily due to changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and u.s. state deferred income tax expense, partially offset by repatriation cost differences.
for further details, see item 8, note 11. income taxes.
asset impairment and exit costs - as a part of the optimization of our global manufacturing infrastructure, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $422 million during 2019, representing $362 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of $0.23 per share. this charge primarily related to a cigarette plant closure in berlin, germany (approximately $0.19 per share), as well as the closure of a cigarette plant in argentina, colombia and pakistan. the total pre-tax charge was included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings. for further details, see item 8, note 21. asset impairment and exit costs.
canadian tobacco litigation-related expense - in the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, relating to the judgment against rbh in two québec smoking and health class actions. the charge of $0.09 per share reflects our assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of rbh and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment. the total pre-tax charge was included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the latin america & canada segment. for further details, see item 8, note 18. contingencies and item 8, note 22. deconsolidation of rbh.
17
loss on deconsolidation of rbh - following the judgment in the two québec smoking and health class actions, rbh obtained an initial order from the ontario superior court of justice granting it protection under the companies' creditors arrangement act ("ccaa"), which is a canadian federal law that permits a canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. the administration of the ccaa process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both pmi and rbh. as a result, we have determined that we no longer have a controlling financial interest over rbh and that we do not exert "significant influence" over rbh under u.s. gaap. therefore, we deconsolidated rbh as of the date of the ccaa filing on march 22, 2019, and will account for our continuing investment in rbh as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.
a loss on the deconsolidation of rbh of $239 million was included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the latin america & canada segment. the $0.12 per share impact also included a tax benefit of $49 million within the provision for income taxes, as discussed above, related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of rbh. for further details, see item 8, note 18. contingencies and item 8, note 22. deconsolidation of rbh.
russia excise and vat audit charge - as a result of the final tax assessment for the 2015-2017 financial years received by our russian affiliate, in the third quarter of 2019, pmi recorded a pre-tax charge of $374 million in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings, representing $315 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of $0.20. the pre-tax charge of $374 million was included in the operating income of the eastern europe segment. for further details, see item 8, note 18. contingencies.
fair value adjustment for equity security investments - in the fourth quarter of 2019, pmi recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for its equity security investments of $35 million after tax (or $0.02 per share increase in diluted eps).  the fair value adjustment for its equity security investments was included in equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net ($44 million income) and provision for income taxes ($9 million expense) on the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019. for further details, see item 8, note 16. fair value measurements.
currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2019 results from the fluctuations of the u.s. dollar, especially against the euro, russian ruble and turkish lira. this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.
interest - the favorable impact of interest was due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act. this included the decision to use existing cash to repay $2.5 billion and $4.0 billion of long-term debt that matured in 2018 and in 2019, respectively.
operations - the increase in diluted eps of $0.22 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:
•   european union: favorable volume/mix and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs and higher manufacturing costs;
•   south &amp; southeast asia: favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs;
•   middle east &amp; africa: favorable pricing, lower manufacturing costs and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix; and
•   east asia &amp; australia: favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs;
partially offset by
•   latin america &amp; canada: unfavorable impact resulting from the deconsolidation of rbh, as well as unfavorable volume/mix, partially offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs, favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs; and
•   eastern europe: higher marketing, administration and research costs and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable volume/mix and favorable pricing.

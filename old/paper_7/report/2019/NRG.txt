•genon executive summary nrg is an integrated power company built on dynamic retail brands with diverse generation assets. nrg brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling electricity and related products and services in major competitive power markets in the u.s. and canada in a manner that delivers value to all of nrg's stakeholders. the company sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services directly to retail customers under the brand names nrg, reliant, green mountain energy, stream and xoom energy, as well as other brand names owned by nrg, supported by approximately 23,000 mw of generation as of december 31, 2019.
business environment the industry dynamics and external influences affecting the company and its businesses, and the power generation and retail energy industry in 2019 and for the future medium term include:
commodities markets - the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates. natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. in 2019, the average natural gas prices at henry hub was 15.0% lower than in 2018.
if long-term gas prices increase, the company is likely to encounter higher realized energy prices, leading to higher energy revenues as lower priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with higher gas and power prices. this impact is partially offset by the retail business, as nrg's retail gross margins have historically decreased as natural gas prices increase.
nrg's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline. this would be partially offset by lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices. to further mitigate this impact, nrg may increase its percentage of coal and nuclear capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading "energy-related commodities" in item 15 - note 6, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, to the consolidated financial statements.
natural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand. the low-priced commodity environment has stressed coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production. if multiple parties withdraw from the market, liquidity could be challenged in the short term. inventory overhang will be utilized to offset production losses. coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.
electricity prices - the price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the company. many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the company's profitability. an increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. the following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which nrg operates for the years ended december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018. ercot power prices were higher primarily due to the continued effect of lower reserve margins as a result of asset retirements in the region. power prices in east region decreased for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.

the average realized power prices for december 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, increased in texas as a result of higher power prices, and decreased in east/west as a result of the roll off of hedges.
clean infrastructure development - policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, rps, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. in addition, the costs associated with the development of clean infrastructure, such as wind and solar generating facilities, continue to decline. these factors continue to drive increases in the development of clean infrastructure in the markets where the company participates, which may impact the ability of the company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. according to ercot, inc., more than 30% of 2019 energy consumption in the ercot market was generated from carbon-free resources with wind power contributing 20%. in addition, subsidies and incentives have contributed to the increase in renewable power sources, and customer awareness and preferences have shifted toward sustainable solutions. increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.
digitization and customization - the electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed and used by end-use customers. the electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. in addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. technologies like smart thermostats, appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.
weather - weather conditions in the regions of the u.s. in which nrg does business influence the company's financial results. weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the company's generating assets. changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the company's results in any given period. typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. the demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. however, all regions of the u.s. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus nrg's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. a significant portion of the company's business is located within texas, and extreme weather conditions occurring in texas may have a material impact on the company's financial position.
other factors - a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for nrg's business. these factors include:
•seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;
•extreme peak demands;
•available supply resources;
•transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;
•location of nrg's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;
•procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and
•changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:
•weather conditions;
•market liquidity;
•capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;
•local transportation systems; and
•the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

the tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 based on the company's reporting segments as of december 31, 2019:

lower gross margin due to weather driven by a decrease in load of 144,000 mwh, unfavorable impact of purchasing incremental supply during extreme weather conditions in summer 2019 at escalated prices above $1,000/mwh and the impact of selling back excess supply in 2019 as compared to 2018                  $(34)

higher gross margin from mass due to higher revenues primarily driven by margin enhancement initiatives of approximately $4.50 per mwh or $278 million, partially offset by higher supply costs driven by an increase in power prices of approximately $4.40 per mwh or $272 million                                   6

liquidity the principal sources of liquidity for nrg's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. as described in item 15 - note 13, debt and finance leases, to the consolidated financial statements, the company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the senior credit facility, the senior notes and the senior secured notes.
the company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in item 15 - note 13, debt and finance leases, to the consolidated financial statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with return of capital and dividend payments to shareholders as described in item 15 - note 16, capital structure, to the consolidated financial statements, acquisition opportunities, and debt repayments.
issuance of 2029 senior notes on may 14, 2019, nrg issued $733 million of aggregate principal amount at par of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2029. the proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 senior notes were utilized to redeem the company's remaining $733 million of 6.25% senior notes due 2024.
issuance of 2024 and 2029 senior secured notes on may 28, 2019, nrg issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $600 million 3.75% senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and $500 million 4.45% senior secured first lien notes due 2029, at a discount. the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the company's 2023 term loan facility.
2023 term loan facility on may 28, 2019, the company repaid its $1.7 billion 2023 term loan facility using the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes, as well as cash on hand, resulting in a decrease of $594 million to long-term debt outstanding. the company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $17 million, which included the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs of $13 million. as a result of the repayment of the outstanding 2023 term loan facility, the company terminated the related interest rate swap agreements, which were in-the-money, and received $25 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.
revolving credit facility modification on may 28, 2019, the company amended its existing credit agreement to, among other things, (i) provide for a $184 million increase in revolving commitments, resulting in aggregate revolving commitments under the amended credit agreement equal to $2.6 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the revolving loans and commitments under the amended credit agreement to may 28, 2024, (iii) provide for a release of the collateral securing the amended credit agreement if nrg obtains an investment grade rating from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to an obligation to reinstate the collateral if such rating agencies withdraw nrg's investment grade rating or downgrade nrg's rating below investment grade, (iv) reduce the applicable margins for borrowings under (a) abr revolving loans from 1.25% to 0.75% and (b) eurodollar revolving loans from 2.25% to 1.75%, (v) add a sustainability-linked pricing metric that permits an interest rate adjustment tied to nrg meeting targets related to environmental sustainability and (vi) make certain other changes to the existing covenants. as of december 31, 2019, $83 million of borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
agua caliente borrower i - non-recourse debt on october 21, 2019, the company repaid the outstanding amount on the agua caliente borrower i notes at 102% plus accrued interest through the payment date.
balance sheet target ratio nrg revised its credit metrics target to 2.5x -2.75x net debt / adjusted ebitda(a) in the first quarter of 2019 in order to further strengthen its balance sheet and improve credit ratings by reducing leverage. as discussed above, during the second quarter of 2019, the company reduced total outstanding debt by $594 million with the repayment of the 2023 term loan facility.
petra nova debt repayment during the third quarter of 2019, nrg contributed approximately $95 million in cash to petra nova and posted a $12 million letter of credit to cover certain project debt reserve requirements. the cash portion of the contribution was used by petra nova to prepay a significant portion of the project debt. as a result, the financial guarantees previously provided by nrg were canceled and the remaining project debt became non-recourse to nrg.

in addition to the debt shown in the above table, nrg had issued $723 million of letters of credit under the company's $2.6 billion revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2019.
commercial operations the company's commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. these liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. as of december 31, 2019, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $190 million and $694 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions. as of december 31, 2019, total funds deposited by counterparties was $32 million in cash and $102 million of letters of credit.
future liquidity requirements may change based on the company's hedging activities and structures, power purchases and sales, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. in addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.
first lien structure nrg has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by nrg and the guarantors of its senior debt. nrg uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. to the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to nrg, the counterparty would have a claim under the first lien program. the first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. the first lien program does not require nrg to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. within the first lien structure, the company can hedge up to 80% of its coal and nuclear capacity and 10% of its other assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. the first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
the company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. as of december 31, 2019, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.
the following table summarizes the amount of mw hedged against the company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of december 31, 2019:

the company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. also, collateral received or posted on the company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the company's portfolio. as discussed in item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, commodity price risk, nrg measures the sensitivity of the company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using var, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. nrg's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period var, which limits the company's net open position. as the company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of nrg's hedging activity. as of december 31, 2019, nrg's net derivative asset was $67 million, a decrease to total fair value of $37 million as compared to december 31, 2018. this decrease was primarily driven by losses in trades settled and contracts acquired during the period, partially offset by increases in change in fair value during the period.
based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $41 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2019.
the impact of a $0.50 per mmbtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $36 million in the net value of derivatives as of december 31, 2019.
critical accounting policies and estimates nrg's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.
on an ongoing basis, nrg evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the company considers reasonable. in any event, actual results may differ substantially from the company's estimates. any effects on the company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.
nrg's significant accounting policies are summarized in item 15 - note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements. the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring regulatory and political environments and requirements derivative instruments the company follows the guidance of asc 815 to account for derivative instruments. asc 815 requires the company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. in certain cases, nrg may apply hedge accounting to the company's derivative instruments. the criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of oci and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.
for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, nrg uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. when external prices are not available, nrg uses internal models to determine the fair value. these internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. these estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
upon repayment of the term loan in 2019, all of the company's interest rate swaps were terminated. in order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions prior to termination, nrg estimated the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period. judgments related to the probability of forecasted borrowings were based on the estimated timing of project construction, which can vary based on various factors. the probability that forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in oci to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the company's earnings.
certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be npns. the availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that nrg has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. these assumptions are based on expected load requirements, available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. derivatives that are considered to be npns are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2019, nrg's deferred tax assets were primarily the result of u.s. federal and state nols, the difference between book and tax basis in property, plant, and equipment, and tax credit carryforwards. the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. the evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.
a valuation allowance of $242 million and $3.8 billion was recorded against nrg's gross deferred tax asset balance as of december 31, 2019, and december 31, 2018, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2019, nrg released the majority of its valuation allowance against its u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, resulting in a non-cash benefit to income tax expense of approximately $3.5 billion.
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate considering changes in facts or circumstances. as of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the company's deferred tax assets. in making the determination to release the majority of the valuation allowance as of december 31, 2019, the company evaluated a number of factors, including its recent history of pre-tax earnings, utilization of $593 million of nols in 2019, as well as its forecasted future pre-tax earnings. based on this evaluation, the company determined that its future u.s. federal tax benefits are more-likely-than-not to be realized. given the company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the company expects to generate income before taxes in the u.s. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its u.s. federal nol carryforwards and the majority of its state nol carryforwards prior to their expiration.
nrg continues to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $242 million as of december 31, 2019 against net deferred tax assets consisting of state net operating losses and foreign nol carryforwards in jurisdictions where the company does not currently believe that the realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not.
nrg continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws, including the impact of the tax act effective december 22, 2017. nrg is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, including operations located in australia.
the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2016. with few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2011.
evaluation of assets for impairment and other-than-temporary decline in value in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment, or asc 360, nrg evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. examples of such indicators or events are:
•significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;
•adverse business climate;
•accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;
•current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and
•change in the company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the company. generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. nrg uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. however, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.
for assets to be held and used, if the company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, nrg must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. the estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. nrg considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. in the absence of such information, the company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. nrg will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability-weights a range of possible outcomes. the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.
annually, during the fourth quarter, the company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. changes to the company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.
as of december 31, 2019, the company recorded impairment losses of approximately $5 million, excluding impairment losses on equity and cost method investments discussed below. these impairment losses were primarily to record the value of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, at fair market value in connection with an impairment indicator.
equity and cost method investments nrg is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired in accordance with asc 323, investments - equity method and joint ventures, or asc 323. the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under asc 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an other-than-temporary decline in value. the evaluation and measurement of impairments under asc 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with asc 360.
similarly, the estimates that nrg makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. additionally, if the projects in which the company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of asc 360, nrg would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under asc 323. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company recorded impairment losses on its equity and cost method investments, primarily petra nova, of $108 million due to declines in value.
goodwill and other intangible assets at december 31, 2019, nrg reported goodwill of $579 million, consisting of $165 million associated with the acquisition of midwest generation and $414 million for retail business acquisitions, including texas non-commodity, xoom and stream energy.
the company applies asc 805, business combinations, or asc 805, and asc 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. under these standards, the company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. the company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. in the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.
the company performed its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the nrg business solutions and retail mass reporting units. the company determined it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these reporting units were more than their carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended december 31, 2019.
the company performed a quantitative assessment for the reporting units in the following table. the company determined the fair value of these reporting units using primarily an income approach. under the income approach, the company estimated the fair value of the reporting units' invested capital exceeds its carrying value and, as such, the company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting units in the following table is not impaired as of december 31, 2019:
reporting unit                                               % fair value over carrying value midwest generation (generation segment)                                      112            %
texas non-commodity (retail segment)                                         140            %
the company believes the methodology and assumptions used in its quantitative assessment are consistent with the views of market participants. significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:
•the company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term forecasts for the midwest generation plants. the significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:
◦the company's views of power and fuel prices consider market prices for the next five years and the company's fundamental view for the longer term, driven by the company's long-term view of the price of natural gas. the company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied power price and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant. the price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where nrg operates power plants. hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;
◦the company's estimate of generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and the existing and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;
◦the company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and
◦projected generation and resulting energy gross margin in the long-term forecasts is based on an hourly dispatch that simulates dispatch of each unit into the power market. the dispatch simulation is based on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant
•the company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the texas non-commodity reporting unit. the significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs: a terminal value utilizing assumed growth rates and discount rates that reflect the inherent cash flow risk.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
contingencies nrg records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. nrg describes in detail its contingencies in item 15 - note 23, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.

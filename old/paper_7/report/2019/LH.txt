item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (in millions)
general during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company's revenue grew by 2.0%, driven by growth from acquisitions of 2.3% and organic growth of 1.6% (which includes the negative impact from pama of 0.9%), partially offset by the disposition of businesses of 1.4% and negative foreign currency translation of 0.5%.
the company defines organic growth as the increase in revenue excluding revenue from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition.
on june 3, 2019, the company's cdd segment completed the acquisition of envigo's nonclinical contract research services business, expanding cdd's global nonclinical drug development capabilities with additional locations and resources. additionally, the company divested the covance research products (crp) business, which was a part of the cdd segment, to envigo. as part of this sale, cdd entered into a multi-year, renewable supply agreement with envigo. the company paid cash consideration of $601.0, received a floating rate secured note of $110.0, and recorded a loss on the sale of crp of $12.2. the company funded the transaction through a new term loan facility. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company also acquired various other businesses and related assets for approximately $286.4 in cash (net of cash acquired).
the company remains on track to deliver $150.0 of net savings from cdd's three-year launchpad initiative by the end of 2020. the company expects phase ii of lcd's launchpad initiative to deliver approximately $200.0 in net savings by the end of 2021, while incurring approximately $40.0 in one-time implementation costs. approximately one-third of the total savings are expected to be realized each year.
the company is also exposed to risks related to information security arising from the information technology systems and operations of third parites, including thosse of the company's vendors and partners. for example, on may 14, 2019, retrieval-masters credit bureau, inc. d/b/a/ american medical collections agency (amca), an external collection agency, notified the company about a security incident amca experienced that may have involved certain personal information about some of the company's patients (the amca incident). the company referred patient balances to amca only when direct collection efforts were unsuccessful. the company's systems were not impacted by the amca incident. upon learning of the amca incident, the company promptly stopped sending new collection requests to amca and stopped amca from continuing to work on any pending collection requests on behalf of the company. amca informed the company that it appeared that an unauthorized user had access to amca's system between august 1, 2018 and march 30, 2019, and that amca could not rule out the possibility that personal
49
information on amca's system was at risk during that time period. information on amca's affected system from the company may have included name, address, and balance information for the patient and person responsible for payment, along with the patient's phone number, date of birth, referring physician, and date of service. the company was later informed by amca that health insurance information may have been included for some individuals, and because some insurance carriers utilize the social security number as a subscriber identification number, the social security number for some individuals may also have been affected. no ordered tests, laboratory test results, or diagnostic infonnation from the company were in the amca affected system. the company notified individuals for whom it had a valid mailing address. for the individuals whose social security number was affected, the notice included an offer to enroll in credit monitoring and identity protection services that will be provided free of charge for 24 months. the company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs related to the amca incident. in addition, the company is involved in pending and threatened litigation related to the amca incident, as well as various government and regulatory inquiries and processes. for additional information about the amca incident, see note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
pama, which went into effect on january 1, 2018, resulted in a net reduction of revenue of approximately $107.0 and $70.0 in 2019 and 2018, respectively from all payers affected by the clinical lab fee schedule. unless further implementation of pama is delayed or changed, an additional reduction of approximately $90.0 is expected for 2020.
effective january 1, 2019, the company adopted accounting standards codification (asc) 842 leases using the modified retrospective method. the company elected the package of practical expedients, which includes not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease, reassessing the classification of existing leases, and reassessing whether previously capitalized initial direct costs qualify for capitalization under the new standard. the company also elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. the adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of $778.1 of additional operating lease liabilities as of december 31, 2019.

on november 25, 2019, the company issued $1,050.0 in debt securities, consisting of $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.300% senior notes due 2024 and $650.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due 2029. the net proceeds from the new senior notes were used to redeem all of the outstanding $500.0 principal amount of its 2.625% senior notes due february 1, 2020, redeem $187.9 of the outstanding 4.625% senior notes due november 15, 2020 in a tender offer, and to repay $348.3 outstanding under the company's term loan credit facilities.
in total, during 2019, the company redeemed or repaid $687.9 million of its senior notes and $1,002.0 million of its term loans. in addition, the company borrowed and repaid a total of $495.0 million of debt through its revolving credit facility within 2019. the company will continue to evaluate all opportunities for strategic deployment of capital in light of market conditions.
the company's revolving credit facility consists of a five year revolving facility in the principal amount of up to $1,000.0 with the option of increasing the facility by up to an additional $350.0, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders to provide such additional amounts and certain other customary conditions.
under the company's term loan credit facilities and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers and the company is required to maintain certain leverage ratios. the company was in compliance with all covenants under the term loan credit facilities and the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2019, the ratio of total debt to consolidated pro forma trailing 12 month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) was 3.1 to 1.0.
at the end of 2018, the company had outstanding authorization from the board of directors to purchase up to $443.5 of company common stock. on february 6, 2019, the board of directors replaced the company's existing share repurchase plan with a new plan authorizing repurchase of up to $1.25 billion of the company's shares. the repurchase authorization has no expiration date. during 2019, the company purchased 2.9 shares of its common stock at an average price of $154.94 for a total cost of $450.0, of which $100.0 was repurchased prior to the new plan in february 2019. at the end of 2019, the company had outstanding authorization from the board of directors to purchase an additional $900.0 of company common stock.
during 2019 and 2018, the company settled notices to convert $8.6 and $0.3 aggregate principal amount at maturity of its zero-coupon subordinated notes due 2021 (the zero-coupon notes) with a conversion value of $16.6 and $0.7, respectively. the total cash used for these settlements was $8.2 and $0.3 and the company also issued 0.1 and 0.0 additional shares of common stock, respectively. as a result of these conversions in 2019 and 2018, the company also reversed approximately $2.0 and $0.2, respectively,

(c)   the table does not include the company's reserve for unrecognized tax benefits. the company had a $37.2 and $26.7 reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at december 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, which is included in note 14 income taxes to consolidated financial statements. for the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately $6.1 of the tax reserve is classified in accrued expenses and other in the company's consolidated balance sheet while the remaining $31.1 is classified in deferred income taxes and other tax liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately $6.0 of the tax reserve is classified in accrued expenses and other in the company's consolidated balance sheet while the remaining $20.7 is classified in deferred income taxes and other tax liabilities.
(d)   interest payments due by period for the company's debt subject to variable interest rates are calculated based on rates in place as of december 31, 2019.
(e)   excludes amount of debt issuance costs included in the long-term debt balance.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have transactions or relationships with "special purpose" entities, and the company does not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases and letters of credit.
other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2019, the company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $76.3, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. letters of credit provided by the company are secured by the company's revolving credit facility and are renewed annually.
the contractual value of the noncontrolling interest put in the company's ontario subsidiary totaled $15.8 and $15.0 at december 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and has been classified as mezzanine equity in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with availability under its revolving credit facility, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its anticipated short-term and long-term cash needs; however, the company continually reassesses its liquidity position in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
55
index liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. while the company believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. the company's audit committee periodically reviews the company's significant accounting policies. the company's critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:
•   revenue recognition;
•   business combinations;
•   pension expense;
•   accruals for self-insurance reserves;
•   income taxes; and
•   goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.
revenue recognition lcd within the lcd segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when lcd receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test. the information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. lcd recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported. revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, medicare and medicaid and third-party.
the following are descriptions of the lcd payer portfolios:
clients client payers represent the portion of lcd's revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations (acos), employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service. generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at lcd's client list price, less any negotiated discount. a portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products. in these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.
patients this portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). uninsured patients are billed based upon lcd's patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. lcd bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract.
medicare and medicaid this portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional medicare and medicaid programs. net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to lcd's results of operations in any period presented.
third-party third-party includes revenue related to mcos. the majority of lcd's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. these payers are billed at lcd's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. the majority of lcd's mco revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted mcos recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.
third-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with mcos and independent physician associations (ipas). under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by lcd from a capitation pool. when the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. lcd recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool.
lcd has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts. the majority of lcd's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. anticipated
56
index write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue an at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value. in addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectablity of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount. any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. these adjustments are not material to lcd's results of operations in any period presented.
cdd the nature of cdd's obligations include agreements to provide preclinical services, to manage a full clinical trial, provide services for a specific phase of a trial, or provide research products to the customer. generally, the amount of the transaction price estimated at the beginning of the contract is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. other payments may also factor into the calculation of transaction price, such as volume-based rebates that are retroactively applied to prior transactions in the period.
historically a majority of cdd's revenues have been earned under contracts that range in duration from a few months to a few years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer. occasionally, cdd also has entered into minimum volume arrangements with certain customers. under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum dollar value of a service commitment is not reached, the customer is required to pay cdd for the shortfall. annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not recognized until the end of the period when the amount has been determined and agreed to by the customer.
cdd recognizes revenue either as services are performed or as products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted. if performance is completed at a specific point in time, the company evaluates the nature of the agreement to determine when the good or service is transferred into the customer's control.
service contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope. in cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue is recognized as services are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided. in an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. the total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be provided.
when using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual units of input incurred by the total units of input budgeted in the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. in each situation, the company believes that the methods used most accurately depict the progress of the company towards completing its obligations. billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. in some cases, cdd bills the customer for the total contract value in progress-based installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration. these milestones include, but are not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing, investigator site initiation, patient enrollment and/or database lock. the term "billing milestone" relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project. these billing milestones are generally not performance-based (i.e., there is no potential additional consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance). in other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time (e.g., monthly billings). in either case, the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the customer would be the same at the end of the project.
proportional performance contracts typically contain a single service (e.g., management of a clinical study) and therefore no allocation of the contract price is required. fee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume. since the volume of activities in a fee-for-service contract is unspecified, the contract price is entirely variable and is allocated to the time period in which it is earned. for contracts that include multiple distinct goods and services, cdd allocates the contract price to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. if a price list is not available, cdd will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an "expected cost plus margin" approach.
while cdd attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of services, this is not always possible. while a project is ongoing, cash payments are not necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms.
in some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized. for example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value upon contract signing, but at the time of signing performance of services has not yet begun. payments received in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the balance sheet. as the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the contract liability balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period.
in other cases, services may be provided and revenue recognized before the customer is invoiced. in these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference, representing a contract asset, is recorded for the amount that is currently
57
index not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. once the customer is invoiced, the contract asset is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. all contract assets are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date.
most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. these contracts often require payment to cdd of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to cdd of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by cdd under the contract if it had not been terminated early. termination fees are included in revenues when services are performed and realization is assured.
the following are descriptions of the full range of drug development services provided by cdd:
preclinical services include fee-for-service activities such as bioanalytical testing services, and proportional performance activities such as toxicology studies. until june 3, 2019, preclinical services also included the sale of research models. see note 3 business acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements for more information. revenue for sale of research models was recognized at a point in time, typically upon shipment, when control transferred to the customer. revenue for bioanalytical testing services is recognized at a point in time upon communication of results to the customer. revenue for proportional performance activities, including toxicology studies, is recognized using an input-based measure of progress in which revenue is recognized as expenses are incurred for the research models, labor hours, and other costs attributable to the study.
through its central laboratory, cdd produces and supplies specimen collection kits that are utilized in clinical studies, and provides transportation, project management, data management, and laboratory testing services on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of its customers' clinical studies. revenue for central laboratory services is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on volume of activities in each period. cdd also provides long-term specimen storage services, for which revenue is recognized using an input-based measure of progress based on costs incurred.
cdd provides clinical development and commercialization services, including clinical pharmacology services, full management of phase ii through iv clinical studies, and market access solutions. revenue for clinical pharmacology services, which includes first-in-human trials, is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on bed nights. the majority of clinical development and commercialization service long-term contracts are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation (e.g., management of a clinical study). revenue for these service contracts is recognized over time based on the progress of the performance obligation which was measured by the proportion of the actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract (including labor and pass-through costs such as investigator grants and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses). this cost-based method of revenue recognition required management to estimate the costs to complete these services on an ongoing basis. clinical services utilizing the input-based measure of progress account for approximately 50% of cdd revenue. revenue for market access solutions is recognized using various methods. revenue for fee-for-service arrangements, such as reimbursement consulting hotlines and patient assistance programs, is recognized using an output method based on transaction volume which corresponds to the amount charged to the customer. for consulting services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.
cdd endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. cdd maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected. this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant. since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management's judgment, actual bad debt write-offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded. historically, bad debt write-offs have not been material.
business combinations the company accounted for business combination transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired entities from its respective date of acquisition. assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. estimated fair values were based on various valuation methodologies including: an income approach using primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the customer relationships intangible assets. the aforementioned income methods utilize management's estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions. the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. the goodwill reflects management's expectations of the ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired entities' historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in the market. none of the goodwill recorded as a result from these transactions is deductible for federal income tax purposes.
as described in note 3 business acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements, the company acquired the nonclinical contract research services business of envigo for consideration of $601.0 in 2019, which resulted in $141.4 of identifiable intangible assets and $379.3 of goodwill being recorded. management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the
58
index customer attrition rates and the discount rate. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company also acquired various businesses and related assets for approximately $286.4 in cash (net of cash acquired). the purchase consideration for all acquisitions year to date has been allocated to the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired, including approximately $184.3 in identifiable intangible assets and a residual amount of non-tax-deductible goodwill of approximately $115.1.
pension expense the company has a defined-benefit retirement plan (company plan) and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (pep). in october 2009, the company received approval from its board of directors to freeze any additional service-based credits for any years of service after december 31, 2009, on the company plan and the pep. both plans have been closed to new participants. employees participating in the company plan and the pep no longer earn service-based credits, but continue to earn interest credits.
the company plan covers substantially all employees employed by the company prior to december 31, 2009. the benefits to be paid under the company plan are based on years of credited service through december 31, 2009, interest credits and average compensation. the company's policy is to fund the company plan with at least the minimum amount required by applicable regulations. the pep covers a portion of the company's senior management group. prior to 2010, the pep provided for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any maximum limitation on annual benefit payments under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the company plan but for such limitation. effective january 1, 2010, employees participating in the pep no longer earn service-based credits. the pep is an unfunded plan.
as a result of the covance acquisition, the company sponsors two defined-benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two u.k. subsidiaries (u.k. plans) and one defined-benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees at a german subsidiary (german plan), all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies and are closed to new entrants. benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years of service and compensation. the german plan is unfunded while the u.k. plans are funded. the company's funding policy for the u.k. plans has been to contribute annually amounts at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.
as a result of the envigo acquisition, the company assumed a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of envigo's u.k. employees (the envigo plan), which is a legacy plan of a company previously acquired by envigo. the envigo plan is a funded plan that is closed to future accrual. the company's funding policy has been to contribute amounts at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.
the company's net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. the company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined-benefit retirement plans were a 3.3% discount rate and a 6.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company plan, a 3.4% discount rate for the pep, a 1.9% discount rate and a 2.0% expected salary increase for the german plan and a 2.9% discount rate, a 3.6% expected salary increase for the u.k. plans and a 2.3% discount rate and 3.9% expected return on assets for the envigo plan as of december 31, 2019.
discount rate the company evaluates several approaches toward setting the discount rate assumption that is used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. at year-end, priority was given to use of the towers watson bond:link model, which simulates the purchase of investment-grade corporate bonds at current market yields with principal amounts and maturity dates closely matching the company's projected cash disbursements from its plans. this completed model represents the yields to maturity at which the company could theoretically settle its plan obligations at year end. the weighted-average yield on the modeled bond portfolio is then used to form the discount rate assumption used for each retirement plan. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2019 retirement plan expense of $2.0 for the company plan and pep. a one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2019 retirement plan expense of $0.4 for the u.k. plans.
return on plan assets in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2019 pension expense of $2.4 for the company plan. a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2019 pension expense of $3.5 for the u.k. plans.
59
index net pension cost for 2019 was $13.8 as compared with $20.9 in 2018 and $14.6 in 2017. the decrease in pension expense was due to decreases in the amount of net amortization and deferral as a result of higher discount rates. in addition, a $7.5 settlement charge was incurred in 2018. pension expense for the company plan and the pep is expected to decrease to $11.8 in 2020 primarily due to the impact of strong asset returns in 2019 for the company plan offset by lower discount rates impacting the pep. pension expense for the germany plan and the u.k. plans is expected to decrease to a credit of $3.5 in 2020, primarily due to the impact of freezing the legacy u.k. plans as of december 31, 2019, leading to a lower service cost in 2020.
further information on the company's defined-benefit retirement plans is provided in note 17 pension and postretirement plans to the consolidated financial statements.
accruals for self-insurance reserves accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers' compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. these estimated liabilities are not discounted.
the company is self-insured (up to certain limits) for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. the company maintains excess insurance which limits the company's maximum exposure on individual claims. the company estimates a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. the liability is based on assumptions and factors for known and incurred but not reported claims, including the frequency and payment trends of historical claims.
if actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted. historical trends have not differed significantly from these estimates.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, the company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized. the company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.
goodwill and indefinite-lived assets the company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. in accordance with updates to the financial accounting standards board's (fasb) authoritative guidance regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, an entity is allowed to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. otherwise, impairment testing must be performed in accordance with the original accounting standards. the updated fasb guidance also allows an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. similarly, a company can proceed directly to a quantitative assessment in the case of impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets as well.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management. the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. for the market-based approach, the company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques. based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
60
index the income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control. at the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:
•   annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.
•   a terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. the terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
•   a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. a discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. in addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.
under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.
management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019. the company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for the domestic lcd reporting units, a quantitative assessment for the cdd reporting units and a quantitative assessment for the canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses.
in the qualitative assessment, the company considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, ii) financial performance versus management's annual and five-year strategic plans, iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. if applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. based on the results of the qualitative assessment, the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.
in 2019, the company utilized a combination of the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of the cdd reporting units and the income approach to determine the fair value of the canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired canadian licenses. based upon the results of the quantitative assessments, the company concluded that the fair values of the goodwill and intangible assets, including the indefinite-lived canadian licenses, was greater than the carrying value.
it is possible that the company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the company's goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2019 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda. the company will continue to monitor the financial performance of and assumptions for one of the cdd reporting units for which an income approach was performed in 2019 and where the fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 10%. goodwill for this reporting unit as of december 31, 2019, was $2.2 billion. management's impairment analysis for this reporting unit utilized significant judgments and assumptions related to the market comparable method analysis, such as selected market multiples, and related to cash flow projections, such as revenue and terminal growth rate, projected operating income, and the discount rate. a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the revenue and terminal growth rate, decreased operation margin or substantial reductions in end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of this reporting unit. a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. management notes that a 1% change in the discount rate would reduce the headroom to approximately 1%.

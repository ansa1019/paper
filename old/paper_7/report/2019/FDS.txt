organic annual subscription value growth organic asv at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenue for the next 12 months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients, excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months, the effects of foreign currency, and professional services. with proper notice to us, our clients can add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. as of august 31, 2019, our organic asv totaled $1.46 billion, up 5.0% organically over the prior year. as of august 31, 2019, organic asv plus professional services was $1.48 billion, an increase of 5.1%, compared to the prior year period.
the increase in year over year organic asv was due to growth across all of our geographic segments with the majority of growth in the u.s., followed by asia pacific and europe. asv growth from our workflow solutions was primarily driven by analytics and trading, cts and wealth. the increase includes sales of products and solutions to new and existing clients, an annual price increase for both the majority of the u.s. and international clients, partially offset by cancellations due primarily to industry-wide cost pressures, firm consolidations and closures. asv growth in analytics and trading was primarily due to increased sales for our portfolio analytics solutions. asv growth in cts was primarily driven by increased sales in core and premium data feeds while asv growth in wealth was mainly due to increased workstation sales.
as of august 31, 2019, asv from the u.s. segment was $909.7 million, an increase of 4.7% from the prior year comparable period. this increase was primarily from analytics and trading, cts and wealth, due to the increased demand for our portfolio analytics solutions, core and premium data feeds and wealth workstations.
asv from the international operations was $548.3 million as of august 31, 2019, an increase of 4.6% over august 31, 2018. international asv represents 37.6% of total asv as of august 31, 2019, remaining consistent with the prior year period. the asv increase from our international operations was due to continued growth in analytics and trading in both asia pacific and europe as well as cts growth in europe. the analytics and trading growth was driven by our portfolio analytics solutions, while the cts growth was due to core and premium data feeds.
buy-side and sell-side asv growth rates for the last 12 months were 4.8% and 6.3% respectively. buy-side clients account for 83.7% of asv, which include traditional asset managers, wealth advisors, corporations, hedge funds, insurance companies, plan sponsors and fund of funds. the remaining portion of asv is derived from sell-side firms that perform m&a advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.

client and user additions our total client count was 5,574 as of august 31, 2019, representing a net increase of 432 clients in the last twelve months. in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed our client count definition to include clients from the april 2017 acquisition of fdsg. the prior year client count was not restated to reflect this change. the net increase was primarily driven by an increase in wealth management and corporate clients. as part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue to focus on expanding and cultivating relationships with our existing client base through sales of workstations, applications, services and content.
as of august 31, 2019, there were 126,822 professionals using factset, representing a net increase of 34,925 or 38.0% in the last 12 months primarily driven by wealth and research workstation sales.
annual client retention as of august 31, 2019 was 89%, when expressed as a percentage of clients. our successful client retention demonstrates that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset year over year, highlighting the strength of our business strategy. as of august 31, 2019, our largest individual client accounted for approximately 3% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions.

cost of services increased 16.4% to $659.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $566.6 million in fiscal 2017. cost of services, expressed as a percentage of revenue, was 48.8% during fiscal 2018, an increase of 240 basis points over fiscal 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs driven by increased employee headcount and restructuring actions, incremental data costs from recent acquisitions and additional users as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expenses from accelerated vesting in fiscal 2017.
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017. the increase is primarily due to the hiring of 497 net new employees over the last 12 months, with the majority of their compensation recorded in cost of services due to their involvement with content collection, engineering and product development. employee compensation expense further increased due to headcount expansion from fiscal 2017 acquisitions that were included for a full year in fiscal 2018, while fiscal 2017 only included a partial year amount. in addition, during fiscal 2018 we incurred $17.4 million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance of which $8.5 million was recorded within cost of services. data costs, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, increased 60 basis points due primarily from our recent acquisitions and higher variable data costs associated with additional users. amortization of acquired intangible assets, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, increased 20 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to recent acquisitions, which added $93.2 million of intangible assets to be amortized over a weighted-average life of 11.5 years. these intangible assets were amortized for the full fiscal 2018, while, fiscal 2017 did not include a similar amount of acquisition amortization due to the dates of each acquisition.
selling, general and administrative fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
sg&a expenses increased 2.8% to $333.9 million during fiscal 2019 compared to $324.6 million in fiscal 2018. this increase was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense and compensation costs, partially offset by a reduction in travel expenses. sg&a expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, were 23.3% in fiscal 2019, a decrease of 70 basis points over the prior year period. this year over year decrease was primarily due to revenue growth outpacing the growth of sg&a related expenses, lower employee compensation and a reduction in travel costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense, when expressed as a percentage of revenue.
employee compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, decreased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018. this decrease is primarily driven by a foreign currency benefit from a stronger u.s dollar, a shift in headcount distribution from our higher to lower cost locations, the timing of new employee hiring, and a restructuring charge impacting the prior year period, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs. travel expenses decreased 30 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, due to an internal focus on cost discipline measures. bad debt expense increased 60 basis points, as a percentage of revenue.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
sg&a expenses increased 7.3% to $324.6 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $302.5 million in fiscal 2017. sg&a expenses, expressed as a percentage of revenue, were 24.0% in fiscal 2018, a decrease of 70 basis points over fiscal 2017. this decrease was primarily due to revenue growth outpacing the growth of sg&a related expenses on a year over year basis, foreign currency exchange gains on hedging activities of our indian rupee and lower overall employee compensation including stock-based compensation expense. this decrease was partially offset primarily by higher legal costs, restructuring actions and new employee additions.
29
employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, when expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2017. the decrease is primarily related to a higher percentage of our employees working in a cost of services capacity compared to an sg&a role. compensation for our employees within the content collection, consulting, product development, software and systems engineering groups is recorded within cost of services while employees within our sales and various other support and administrative departments are reflected in sg&a. in fiscal 2018, the majority of our hiring had been in departments within cost of services, thus driving a higher percentage of our employee compensation in this area. partially offsetting these decreases were higher legal expenses primarily from the settlement of a legal matter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a full year of employee compensation from acquisitions and $8.9 million of severance charges.
operating income and operating margin fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
operating income increased 19.6% to $438.0 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $366.2 million in fiscal 2018. operating income increased due to revenue growth, favorable foreign exchange rates which reduced the overall operating expense impact and mainly resulted in a reduction in compensation expense, as well as, decreased costs from restructuring actions, decreased travel expenses and contractor fees, partially offset by an increase in data costs, computer-related expenses and bad debt expense. our operating margin increased in fiscal 2019 to 30.5%, compared to 27.1% for fiscal 2018. operating margin increased due to incremental revenue that outpaced the growth of our operating expenses year over year, favorable foreign exchange rates, which reduced the overall operating expense impact and mainly resulted in a reduction in compensation expense, as well as, lower costs from restructuring actions, a reduction in travel expenses, partially offset by higher bad debt expense and computer-related expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
operating income increased 4.0% to $366.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $352.1 million in fiscal 2017. our operating margin decreased in fiscal 2018 to 27.1%, compared to 28.8% for fiscal 2017. operating income increased due to incremental revenue that outpaced the growth of sg&a expenses year over year partially offset by higher cost of services. the reduction in operating margin year over year was due to an increase in employee compensation costs, including restructuring actions, data costs from acquisitions and additional users, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, and incremental legal fees partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains on hedging activities and lower stock-based compensation.

our operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business, the demographic markets we serve, and how the codmg assesses performance. our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments, the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which we believe helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve. sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment. each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, office and other direct expenses. expenditures associated with our data centers, third-party data costs and corporate headquarter charges are recorded by the u.s. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. the centers of excellence, located in india and the philippines, primarily focus on content collection that benefit all our segments. the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenue.

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
u.s. operating income increased 21.1% to $179.4 million during fiscal 2019, compared to $148.1 million a year ago. the increase in u.s. operating income was primarily due to revenue growth of 6.3% and a reduction in compensation expense, partially offset by increased computer-related expenses, data costs, bad debt expense and occupancy expense. compensation expense decreased due to a net reduction in headcount of 4.9% over the past 12 months, the timing of new employee hiring, and a restructuring charge impacting the prior year period, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs. computer related expenses increased year over year primarily due to increased costs from cloud-based hosting and licensed software arrangements. data costs increased due to increased acquisition costs of fixed cost content and additional spend on variable cost content to drive revenue growth. occupancy costs increased primarily related to leasing the new corporate headquarters space in norwalk, connecticut.
european operating income increased 20.3% to $179.3 million during fiscal 2019, compared to $149.0 million a year ago. the increase in european operating income was primarily due to revenue growth of 5.3% and an overall reduction in operating expenses driven mainly by a decrease in employee compensation expense and occupancy expense, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. employee compensation decreased primarily due to a foreign currency benefit from a stronger u.s. dollar, a restructuring charge impacting the prior year period, partially offset by a net headcount increase of 2.9% over the past 12 months. occupancy costs decreased due to a one-time adjustment recognized in fiscal 2019. the impact of foreign currency increased european operating income by $6.6 million year over year.
asia pacific operating income increased 14.9% to $79.4 million during fiscal 2019, compared to $69.1 million a year ago. the increase in asia pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 10.0% and benefits from a stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by increases in compensation expense and occupancy costs. employee compensation was higher, year over year, due to a 3.3% increase in our asia pacific workforce, partially offset by a foreign currency benefit from a stronger u.s. dollar. occupancy costs increased due primarily to the expansion of office space in india and the philippines. the impact of foreign currency increased asia pacific operating income by $3.2 million year over year.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
u.s. operating income increased 8.0% to $148.1 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $137.1 million in fiscal 2017. the increase in u.s. operating income was primarily due to revenue growth of 7.4%, partially offset by increased expenses related to employee compensation, computer equipment and data costs. employee compensation increased primarily due to annual base salary increases, restructuring actions, and higher employee benefit costs including medical expenditures. computer related expenses, which include depreciation, maintenance, software and other fees, increased year over year due to expenses associated with upgrades to existing computer systems in norwalk, additional server equipment in our data centers located in new jersey and virginia, as well as laptop computers and peripherals for new and existing employees. data costs increased due to higher third-party data costs from our recent acquisitions and additional users.
european operating income decreased 3.1% to $149.0 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $153.7 million in fiscal 2017. the impact of foreign currency decreased european operating income by $4.9 million year over year. additionally, the decrease in european operating income was due to a full year impact of fiscal 2017 acquisitions, that contributed to higher employee compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and data costs, partially offset by revenue growth of 17.3%.
asia pacific operating income increased 12.7% to $69.1 million during fiscal 2018 compared to $61.4 million in fiscal 2017. the increase in asia pacific operating income was due to revenue growth of 13.1% and benefits from a stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by increases in employee compensation and occupancy costs. employee compensation was higher year over year as result of a 9.2% increase in our asia pacific workforce. occupancy costs increased due primarily to an increase in rent expense for additional office space in our philippines location. the impact of foreign currency increased asia pacific operating income by $3.6 million year over year.

income taxes fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
the fiscal 2019 provision for income taxes was $69.2 million, a decrease of 18.4% from the same period a year ago. the decrease was primarily attributable to the enactment of the tcja. the tcja imposed a one-time transition tax expense, which resulted in a $23.2 million impact to the income tax provision for fiscal 2018, without a comparable impact in fiscal 2019. this transition tax impact was revised during fiscal 2019, resulting in a net benefit of $3.4 million upon finalizing the accounting for the tax effects of the tcja. the tcja also lowered the statutory u.s corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, which was fully applicable for fiscal 2019 compared to the lower tax rate being phased in for the prior year comparable period. the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate required a remeasurement of our net u.s. deferred tax position, which resulted in a non-recurring tax charge of $2.2 million during fiscal 2018. the decrease in the income tax provision year over year was partially offset by a $3.3 million income tax expense from finalizing prior years' tax returns and other discrete items for fiscal 2019.
our effective tax rate was 16.4% for the full fiscal 2019 year compared to 24.1% a year ago was mainly due the reduction in the federal statutory rate from the enactment of the tcja that was fully applicable for fiscal year 2019 compared to being phased in for the prior year comparable period. the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was also due to the one-time transition tax from the tcja that was recorded in the prior year period. these benefits were partially offset by higher foreign income taxed at rates lower than u.s. rates.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
the fiscal 2018 provision for income taxes was $84.8 million, a decrease of 1.5% from fiscal 2017. the decrease was primarily attributable to the impacts associated with the u.s. tax reform under the tcja. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja. the tcja, among other things, lowered the statutory u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018. due to our august 31 fiscal year-end, the lower tax rate was phased in, resulting in a blended u.s. statutory federal rate of 25.7% for fiscal 2018. the tcja also implemented a modified territorial tax system and imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings and profits ("e&p") of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from u.s. income taxes.
our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the full fiscal 2018 year compared to 25.0% in fiscal 2017, due to higher foreign income taxed at rates lower than u.s. rates, incremental income tax benefits from r&d tax credits and increased excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. these benefits were partially offset by the one-time transition tax of $23.2 million and a $2.3 million tax expense associated with the remeasurement of our net u.s. deferred tax position, both of which related to the tcja. we had approximately $250 million in undistributed foreign e&p generated prior to december 31, 2017, which resulted in the provisional amount for the one-time transition tax expense of $23.2 million, payable over an eight-year period.
net income and diluted earnings per share fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
net income increased 32.1% to $352.8 million while diluted earnings per share increased 33.9% to $9.08 during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. net income and diluted eps increased primarily due to higher operating income, a reduction in the income tax provision primarily due to the tcja reform, partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our outstanding debt. diluted eps also benefited from a 0.5 million share reduction in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding, compared to the same period a year ago, mainly due to share repurchases, partially offset by the impact from stock options issued.
32
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
net income increased 3.4% to $267.1 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 4.1% to $6.78 during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. net income and diluted eps grew primarily from higher revenue from strong performances across our segments and workflow solutions, gains earned from our foreign currency hedges, and a decrease in our effective tax rate due to the tcja. these benefits were partially offset by an increase in employee compensation expenses, data costs, amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, occupancy costs, and interest expense associated with our outstanding debt. diluted eps also benefited from a 0.3 million reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to share repurchases partially offset by stock option exercises during fiscal 2018.
non-gaap financial measures to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap, we use non-gaap financial measures including organic revenue, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. the reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are shown in tables below. these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with gaap. moreover, these non-gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with gaap. other companies may calculate similarly titled non-gaap financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
despite the limitations of these non-gaap financial measures, we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals. adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance.

(2)   free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures.

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $359.8 million, or 23.1% of total assets at august 31, 2019, compared with $208.6 million, or 14.7% of total assets at august 31, 2018. our cash and cash equivalents increased $151.2 million during fiscal 2019, primarily due to $575.0 million in proceeds from debt, $427.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $107.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $3.3 million in net proceeds from investments. these cash inflows were partially offset by $575.0 million related to the repayment of debt, $220.4 million in share repurchases (which included $213.1 million under the existing share repurchase program and $7.3 million in shares repurchased from employees to cover their cost of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock), $100.1 million in dividend payments, $59.4 million of capital expenditures, and $5.6 million from the effects of foreign currency translations.
net cash used in investing activities was $56.1 million in fiscal 2019, representing a $7.6 million increase in cash used from investing activities, compared to fiscal 2018. this increase was primarily due to $25.9 million of higher capital expenditures, offset by a $15.0 million decrease in acquisition activity, and a $3.3 million increase in net proceeds from investments (net of purchases).
during fiscal 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $214.3 million, representing a $105.8 million decrease from fiscal 2018. this decrease was due primarily to $575.0 million of borrowings under our 2019 credit agreement, an $83.6 million decrease in share repurchases and a $35.4 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans. this decrease was partially offset by the $575.0 million retirement of the 2017 credit agreement and a $10.6 million increase in dividend payments. refer to the capital resources section of the md&a for a discussion on our long-term debt borrowings.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. as of august 31, 2019, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $359.8 million, with $132.6 million included in the u.s. segment, the majority of which is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $183.5 million in the europe segment, predominantly within bank accounts in the uk, france, and germany, and the remaining $43.7 million held in the asia pacific segment. as of august 31, 2019, we also had $574.2 million in outstanding borrowings (net of $0.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs). we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter, for the foreseeable future.

free cash flow generated in fiscal 2019 was $367.8 million, an increase of 4.4% compared to $352.1 million in fiscal 2018. free cash flow is the result of $427.1 million of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $59.4 million in capital expenditures. the year over year increase to free cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and an increase in client collections due to a reduction in our days sales outstanding ("dso") to 37 days as of august 31, 2019, compared to 41 days for the prior year period, partially offset by higher capital requirements from the build-out of new office space and the timing of supplier and tax payments.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $208.6 million, or 14.7% of our total assets at august 31, 2018, compared with $194.7 million, or 13.8% of our total assets at august 31, 2017. our cash and cash equivalents increased $13.9 million during fiscal 2018 due to net cash provided by operating activities of $385.7 million and $71.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. these cash inflows were partially offset by $89.4 million in dividend payments, $33.5 million of capital expenditures, $15.0 million related to a business investment, $3.2 million from the effects of foreign currency translations and $303.9 million in share repurchases, which included $302.4 million under the existing share repurchase program and $1.5 million in shares repurchased from employees to cover their cost of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock.
net cash used in investing activities was $48.5 million in fiscal 2018, representing a $298.8 million decrease from fiscal 2017. this reduction was primarily due to decreased acquisition activity with $15.0 million invested in fiscal 2018 compared to $303.1 million largely related to the bi-sam technologies ("bisam") and vermilion holdings limited ("vermilion") acquisitions in fiscal 2017. additionally, cash used in investing activities decreased year over year due to lower capital expenditures of $3.3 million and a decrease in the purchase of investments (net of proceeds) of $7.4 million year over year during fiscal 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $320.0 million, representing a $311.9 million increase from fiscal 2017. this increase was due to $275.0 million in proceeds (net of repayment) from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 that did not occur in fiscal 2018. in addition, the decrease was due to higher dividend payments of $8.5 million, an increase in share repurchases of $43.0 million, and a change in the presentation of tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements due to the adoption of the accounting standard update, which required us to disclose benefits from stock option exercises as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing activity. this presentation change was adopted prospectively beginning with fiscal 2018. these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock plans of $21.6 million.
free cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 was $352.1 million, an increase of 24.1% compared to $283.7 million in fiscal 2017. free cash flow was attributable to $267.1 million of net income, $87.0 million of non-cash items, $31.6 million of working capital changes, less $33.5 million in capital expenditures. the year over year free cash flow growth was driven by positive working capital changes totaling $47.6 million and lower capital expenditures of $3.3 million. working capital improved year over year due to timing of supplier payments and payroll, stabilization of our days sales outstanding ("dso") at 41 days and the adoption of an accounting standard update for share-based payments, which required the presentation of benefits from stock options exercised to be reported as an operating activity, when in prior periods it was reported as a financing activity.
capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $59.4 million during fiscal 2019, compared to $33.5 million a year ago. capital expenditures of $28.0 million, or 47%, were primarily related to corporate infrastructure investments, additional server equipment for our data centers located in new jersey and virginia, as well as computers and peripherals for new office space primarily in india. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build-out of office space, with $22.3 million related to the new corporate headquarters in norwalk, connecticut and $6.6 million related to new office space in india.
capital expenditures were $33.5 million during fiscal 2018, down from $36.9 million in fiscal 2017. capital expenditures of $24.2 million, or 72% of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 related to upgrades to existing computer systems in norwalk, additional server equipment in our data centers located in new jersey and virginia, as well as laptop computers and peripherals for new and existing employees. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including $2.2 million at our india location, $2.8 million at our hong kong location and $1.5 million at our netherlands location.

capital needs long-term debt
2019 credit agreement on march 29, 2019, the company entered into the 2019 credit agreement ("the 2019 credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and pnc bank, national association ("pnc"), as the administrative agent and lender. the 2019 credit agreement provides for a $750.0 million revolving credit facility ("the 2019 revolving credit facility"). factset may request borrowings under the 2019 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 29, 2024. the 2019 credit agreement also allows factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million.
factset borrowed $575.0 million of the available $750.0 million provided by the 2019 revolving credit facility, resulting in $175.0 million available to be withdrawn. factset is required to pay a commitment fee using a pricing grid currently at 0.10% based on the daily amount by which the available balance in the 2019 revolving credit facility exceeds the borrowed amount. all outstanding loan amounts are reported as long-term debt within the consolidated balance sheets at august 31, 2019. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
the fair value of our long-term debt was $575.0 million as of august 31, 2019, which the company believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis. borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid, currently at 0.875%. during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, factset recorded interest expense of $19.8 million, $15.9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, on its outstanding debt amounts. the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 3.35% and 2.69% as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly, in arrears, and on the maturity date.
during fiscal 2019, factset incurred approximately $0.9 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2019 credit agreement. these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense ratably over the term of the 2019 credit agreement.
the 2019 credit agreement contains covenants and requirements restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan. in addition, the 2019 credit agreement requires that factset maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio, as measured by total net funded debt/ebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the company was in compliance with all the covenants and requirements within the 2019 credit agreement as of august 31, 2019.
the borrowings from the 2019 credit agreement were used to retire all outstanding debt under the previous 2017 credit agreement between factset, as the borrower, and pnc as the lender on march 29, 2019. the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was $575.0 million and there were no prepayment penalties.
2017 credit agreement on march 17, 2017, the company entered into a credit agreement (the "2017 credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and pnc bank, national association ("pnc"), as the administrative agent and lender. the 2017 credit agreement provided for a $575.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2017 revolving credit facility"). the 2017 credit agreement also allowed factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to $225.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. factset could have requested borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity or retirement date. borrowings under the loan were subject to interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. interest on the loan outstanding was payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. there were no prepayment penalties if the company elected to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date. the principal balance was repaid in full on march 29, 2019.
37
letters of credit from time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. approximately $2.8 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our leased office spaces as of august 31, 2019. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.
foreign currency foreign currency exposure certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the europe and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a component of stockholders' equity.
our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where 76% of our employees were located as of august 31, 2019. during fiscal 2019, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $10.1 million, compared to a decrease in operating income by $1.3 million for fiscal 2018.
foreign currency hedges as of august 31, 2019, we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposures:
•   philippine peso - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our philippine peso exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

•   indian rupee - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 50% of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and 25% of our indian rupee exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

•   euro - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our euro exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 50% of our euro exposure from the second quarter through the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and 25% of our euro exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

•   british pound sterling - foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of our british pound sterling exposure through the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 50% of our british pound sterling exposure from the second quarter through the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and 25% of our british pound sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

as of august 31, 2019, the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos and indian rupees with u.s. dollars was ₱1.4 billion and rs.1.4 billion, respectively. the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase u.s. dollars with euros and british pound sterling was €35.7 million and £20.5 million, respectively.
there were no other outstanding foreign currency contracts as of august 31, 2019. a loss on derivatives of $1.8 million was recorded in operating income during fiscal 2019, compared to a gain of $3.1 million in fiscal 2018.
38
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. in fiscal 2019, we repurchased 0.9 million shares for $213.1 million compared to 1.5 million shares for $302.4 million in fiscal 2018 under the existing share repurchase program. over the last 12 months, we have returned $320.4 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
on june 24, 2019, the board of directors of factset approved a $210.0 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program. subsequent to this expansion, $238.6 million is available for future repurchases as of august 31, 2019.
contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments, as well as, necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors disclosed below. as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total purchase commitments with suppliers of $83.3 million and $79.0 million, respectively. there were no material changes in the company's purchase commitments with suppliers during fiscal 2019.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31, 2019 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid, and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are received, as well, as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.
on february 14, 2018, we entered into a new lease to relocate our corporate headquarters to 45 glover avenue in norwalk, connecticut. the new location will comprise approximately 173,000 square feet of office space. we took possession of the newly leased property on january 1, 2019 for fit-out purposes. we will continue to occupy our existing headquarters space until the new headquarters property is ready for occupancy, currently estimated to be in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2019, our worldwide leased office space increased to approximately 1,860,000 square feet at august 31, 2019, up 110,000 square feet, or 6.3% from august 31, 2018. this increase was primarily related to additional office space in india. future minimum requirements for our operating leases in place as of august 31, 2019 totaled $400.0 million, a decrease from $407.8 million as of august 31, 2018. this decrease is primarily due the passage of a year on remaining rental agreement terms, reducing the overall future minimum lease obligation, partially offset by added office space in india.
as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this md&a, we entered into the 2019 credit agreement on march 29, 2019 and borrowed $575.0 million. in conjunction with the 2019 credit agreement, factset retired its loan outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement amount of $575.0 million.
with the exception of the new leases entered in the ordinary course of business, there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2019.
dividends on august 9, 2019, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.72 to be paid on september 19, 2019. the $0.08 per share or 12.5% increase marked our 14th consecutive year we have increased dividends, highlighting our continued commitment to returning value to shareholders. over the last 12 months, we have returned $320.4 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. dividends must be authorized by our board of directors.
during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our board of directors declared the following dividends on our common stock:

significant accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
business combinations the company accounts for its business combinations  using the purchase method of accounting. the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and assigned to one or more reporting units. the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the expected useful life, requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
performance-based equity awards performance-based equity awards, whether in the form of stock options or restricted stock, require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance targets. the number of performance-based awards that vest will be predicated on achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant. dependent on the financial performance levels attained, a percentage of the performance-based awards will vest to the grantees. however, there is no current guarantee that such awards will vest in whole or in part.
june 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of bisam, factset granted 206,417 performance-based stock options in june 2017. these performance-based options were scheduled to vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date, if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets were achieved by march 31, 2019. in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, it was determined that the performance criteria were not achieved by march 31, 2019, and, as such, the options were forfeited, and no stock-based compensation expense was recorded for this performance-based option grant for fiscal 2019.
accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. we conduct a final review of company, departmental and individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. as of august 31, 2019, and 2018, the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $49.4 million and $43.6 million, respectively.

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. at least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group ("codmg"), composed of the ceo and executive management, manages the business and the demographic markets we serve. the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries or business units within each operating segment. the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. in fiscal 2019, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for the reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. in performing a qualitative assessment, factset considers such factors as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions in which factset operates including the competitive environment and significant changes in demand for the company's services. the company also considers its share price both in absolute terms and in relation to peer companies. if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if factset elects not to perform a qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists.
future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist, and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, consistent with the timing of previous years. it was determined that there was no impairment, as it was not more likely than not the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value, using the qualitative screen. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, was $685.7 million and $701.8 million, respectively.
our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. the weighted average useful life of our identifiable intangible assets at august 31, 2019 was 12.6 years. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no material adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets had no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2019 and 2018.
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold, and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted). no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2019 and 2018, was $120.6 million and $148.9 million, respectively.

long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful, and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and excluding interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets was $132.5 million as of august 31, 2019 and $100.5 million as of august 31, 2018.
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and the foreign derived intangible income deduction. our annual effective tax rate was 16.4%, 24.1% and 25.0% in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
to account for unrecognized tax benefits, we first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including associated interest and penalties, requires significant estimates. there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, however, we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes and/or penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial position, beyond current estimates. for this reason and due to ongoing audits by multiple tax authorities, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months.
43
we classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as taxes payable (non-current) and to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year, the benefit will be classified as taxes payable (current). additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. this interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. as of august 31, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $10.9 million, including $1.1 million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) within the consolidated balance sheets.
new accounting pronouncements see note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
shift from active to passive investment management approximately 83.7% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes. moreover, a shift from active investment management to passive investment management can result in lower demand for our services. our investment banking clients that provide m&a advisory work, capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 16.3% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large, bulge-bracket banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. our clients could also encounter similar issues. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in m&a funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. our revenue may decline if banks, including those involved in merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the challenges faced by other departments.
brexit on june 23, 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union ("brexit"). on march 29, 2017, the united kingdom invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty, formally starting negotiations with the european union. united kingdom and european union leaders then backed an extension until october 31, 2019, to provide more time to complete negotiations on formal withdrawal and transitional arrangements. on october 17, 2019 a new brexit deal was agreed between the european union and the uk government. on october 22, 2019 the uk parliament approved the new brexit deal but rejected the timing of its implementation. following the vote in the uk parliament, european council president donald tusk confirmed that he would recommend that the european union leaders agree to a third extension to the article 50 period until january 31, 2020, to give the united kingdom more time to scrutinize the new brexit deal, and to avoid a no-deal brexit. the political and economic instability created by the brexit vote has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in global financial markets. at this time, we cannot predict the impact that brexit will have on our business as it will depend, in part, on the longer-term outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets.

markets in financial instruments directive ("mifid")
mifid ii built upon many of the initiatives introduced through mifid and is intended to help improve the functioning of the european union single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. mifid originally became effective in 2007 and was enhanced through adoption of mifid ii, which became effective in january 2018. we continue to monitor the impact in the european union of mifid ii on the investment process and trade lifecycle, as well as any impact of mifid ii on non-european union countries. we also continue to review the application of key mifid ii requirements in the event of a no-deal brexit in light of a recent publication by the european securities and markets authority. we plan to work with our clients to navigate the mifid ii requirements.

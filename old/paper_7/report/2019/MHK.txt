mohawk is a significant supplier of every major flooring category with manufacturing operations in 19 nations and sales in more than 170 countries. based on its annual sales, the company believes it is the world's largest flooring manufacturer. a majority of the company's long-lived assets are located in the united states and europe, which are also the company's primary markets. the company expects continued growth in the united states market consistent with residential housing starts and remodeling investments and has invested significantly in state-of-the-art manufacturing to create aspirational products to delight consumers with beauty and performance. the company also is a leading provider of flooring for the u.s. commercial market and has earned significant recognition for its innovation in design and performance as well as its sustainable products and practices. additionally, the company maintains significant operations in europe, russia, mexico, australia, new zealand, brazil and other parts of the world. the company is growing share in many markets through its differentiated products, especially its ceramic tile collections.
during the past two decades, the company has grown significantly. its current geographic breadth and diverse product offering are reflected in three reporting segments: global ceramic; flooring north america ("flooring na"); and flooring rest of the world ("flooring row"). the global ceramic segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone tile and other products including natural stone, quartz and porcelain slab countertops, which it distributes primarily in north america, europe, brazil and russia through various selling channels, which include company-owned stores, independent distributors and home centers. the flooring na segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering products, including broadloom carpet, carpet tile, rugs, carpet cushion, laminate and vinyl products, including luxury vinyl tile (lvt) and sheet vinyl, and wood flooring, all of which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. the segment's product lines are sold through various channels, including independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, online retailers, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. the flooring row segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, vinyl products, including lvt and sheet vinyl, wood flooring, roofing panels, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard ("mdf") and chipboards, which it distributes primarily in europe, russia, australia and new zealand through various channels, including independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, company-owned distributors, home centers, commercial contractors and commercial end users.
the company is managing through current macroeconomic headwinds including significant inflation, a strong u.s. dollar that is impacting currency translation as well as strengthening the competitiveness of imports in the u.s., slowing housing markets in a number of countries and a shift in consumer preferences to luxury vinyl tile. the company has implemented multiple price increases in most product categories due to escalating material, transportation and energy costs in most markets. while focused on addressing current conditions, the company remains committed to its long-term growth strategy, which includes strategic acquisitions in key growth markets and targeted internal investments that are expanding the company's geographic reach and product portfolio.
in 2018, the company completed five acquisitions: two that expanded the company's global footprint with leadership positions in major markets and three that extended the company's product offering and distribution in europe. the godfrey hirst acquisition established the company as the largest flooring manufacturer in australia and new zealand, with leading carpet and hard surface positions in both countries when combined with the company's existing regional flooring distribution business. godfrey hirst's prestigious wool carpet collections are exported to numerous international markets and have been integrated into the u.s. soft surface product portfolio to expand sales. the acquisition of brazil-based eliane provided the company with a leading ceramic tile position and the most appealing brand in one of the world's largest ceramic markets and created a gateway into the overall south american market as eliane is brazil's largest ceramic exporter. the acquisition of berghoef, a leading european mezzanine flooring company, created a leading position in a category that is rapidly expanding due to increased construction of e-commerce warehousing across the continent. the acquisition of swiss and italian hard surface distributors expanded the company's direct distribution of flooring sales in europe.
index to financial statements in 2019, the company invested approximately $545.5 million in capital projects to introduce new product categories, enter new markets, expand capacity of constrained premium products and improve productivity.  in 2020, the company plans to invest approximately an additional $560-$580 million to complete existing projects and commence new initiatives. the company plans to invest in cost reduction initiatives, upgrades in recent acquisitions, previously initiated expansion projects and maintenance across the businesses. the main investment areas include the company's newly acquired ceramic business in brazil and the godfrey hirst group in australia and new zealand where the company is investing to dramatically improve profitability; premium water-resistant laminate in the u.s.; outdoor tile manufacturing in europe; and premium sanitary ware manufacturing in russia.
net earnings attributable to the company were $744.2 million, or diluted eps of $10.30 for 2019 compared to net earnings attributable to the company of $861.7 million, or diluted eps of $11.47 for 2018. the decrease in eps was primarily attributable to higher inflation costs, the unfavorable net impact of price and product mix, an impairment charge related to the company's net investment in a manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in china, the unfavorable net impact due to lower sales volumes, an increase in costs due to lower productivity (offset by lower startup costs), costs due to temporarily reducing production, the unfavorable net impact from foreign exchange rates, costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel and marketing, partially offset by decreased income tax expense. the company implemented select operational, administrative and financial restructurings that centralized certain business processes and intangible assets in various european jurisdictions into a new entity (the "european restructuring"). the european restructuring resulted in a current income tax liability of $148.2 million, calculated in part by measuring the fair value of intangible assets transferred. the company offset the income tax liability with the utilization of $148.2 million of deferred tax assets from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards. the european restructuring also resulted in the company recording a $136.2 million deferred tax asset, and a corresponding deferred tax benefit, related to the tax basis of the intangible assets in the new entity.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, the company generated $1,418.8 million of cash from operating activities. as of december 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $134.8 million, of which $24.8 million was in the united states and $110.0 million was in foreign countries.

interest expense interest expense was $41.3 million for 2019, reflecting an increase of $2.5 million compared to interest expense of $38.8 million for 2018. the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowings during the year.
other expense (income)
other expense was $36.4 million for 2019, reflecting an unfavorable change of $29.1 million compared to other expense of $7.3 million for 2018. the change was primarily attributable to a net impairment charge of $59.9 million related to the company's net investment in a manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in china, partially offset by favorable fx and other miscellaneous items.
index to financial statements income tax expense for 2019, the company recorded income tax expense of $5.0 million on earnings before income taxes of $749.5 million for an effective tax rate of 0.7%, as compared to an income tax expense of $184.3 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,049.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.6% for 2018. the company implemented select operational, administrative and financial restructurings that centralized certain business processes and intangible assets in various european jurisdictions into a new entity. the european restructuring resulted in a current income tax liability of $148.2 million, calculated in part by measuring the fair value of intangible assets transferred. the company offset the income tax liability with the utilization of $148.2 million of deferred tax assets from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards. the european restructuring also resulted in the company recording a $136.2 million deferred tax asset, and a corresponding deferred tax benefit, related to the tax basis of the intangible assets in the new entity. the tax rate for the company was also favorably impacted by its geographic mix of earnings.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. the company's liquidity needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, commercial paper, bank credit lines, term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers. as of december 31, 2019, the company had a total of $1,066.5 million available under its senior credit facility. the company also maintains local currency revolving lines of credit and other credit facilities to provide liquidity to its businesses around the world.  none of such local facilities are material in amount.

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2019 was $616.0 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,332.2 million for the year ended 2018. the decrease was primarily due to a $487.9 million reduction in acquisitions and a $248.6 million reduction in capital expenditures. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2018 was $1,332.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,240.7 million for the year ended 2017. the increase was primarily due to a $318.2 million increase in acquisitions, partially offset by a $111.9 million reduction in capital expenditures. the company continues to invest to optimize sales and profit growth with product expansion and cost reduction projects in the business.
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 2019 was $789.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $198.0 million for the year ended 2018. the change in cash used in financing is primarily attributable to lower borrowings of commercial paper of $860.6 million. net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2018 was $198.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.0 million for the year ended 2017. the change in cash provided by financing is primarily attributable to increased borrowings of commercial paper, offset by purchases of the company's shares of $274.1 million senior credit facility on october 18, 2019, the company amended and restated its $1,800.0 million senior credit facility, extending the maturity from march 26, 2022 to october 18, 2024 (as amended and restated, the "senior credit facility"). the senior credit facility marginally reduced the commitment fee and modified certain negative covenants to provide the company with additional flexibility, including flexibility to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness. the amendment also renewed the company's option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility up to two times for an additional one-year period each.
at the company's election, revolving loans under the senior credit facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) libor for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.00% and 1.75% (1.125% as of december 31, 2019), or (b) the higher of the wells fargo bank, national association prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or the eurocurrency rate (as defined in the senior credit facility) rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% (0.125% as of december 31, 2019). the company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the senior credit facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders exceed utilization of the senior credit facility ranging from 0.09% to 0.20% per annum (0.11% as of december 31, 2019). the applicable margins and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the company's consolidated net leverage ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).
the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries in respect of the senior credit facility are unsecured.
index to financial statements the senior credit facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the company's business. the company is also required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. the limitations contain customary exceptions or, in certain cases, do not apply as long as the company is in compliance with the financial ratio requirements and is not otherwise in default. however, at the company's election upon the occurrence of certain material acquisitions, a step up of the maximum permitted consolidated net leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for the four (4) fiscal quarter period of the company commencing with the fiscal quarter during which said acquisition(s) closes.
the senior credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.
in 2019, the company paid financing costs of $2.3 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of its senior credit facility. these costs were deferred and, along with previously unamortized costs of $3.4 million are being amortized over the term of the senior credit facility.
as of december 31, 2019, amounts utilized under the senior credit facility included $16.8 million of borrowings and $22.8 million of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments. the outstanding borrowings of $693.9 million under the company's u.s. and european commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2019 reduce the availability of the 2019 senior credit facility. including commercial paper borrowings, the company has utilized $733.5 million under the senior credit facility resulting in a total of $1,066.5 million available as of december 31, 2019.

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. in reaching such decisions, the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.
•   accounts receivable and revenue recognition. the company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. the nature of the promised goods are ceramic, stone, carpet, resilient, laminate, wood and other flooring products. payment is typically received 90 days or less from the invoice date. the company adjusts the amounts of revenue for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, and claims, based upon historical experience. the company adjusts accounts receivable for doubtful account allowances based upon historical bad debt, claims experience, periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts, and the aging of index to financial statements accounts receivable. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. a 10% change in the company's allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019.
•   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method ("fifo"). costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost, and a 10% change in the company's assumptions for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2019.
•   acquisition accounting. the fair value of the consideration the company pays for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill. the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. the impact of prior or future acquisitions on the company's financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. see note 2, acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.
•   goodwill and other intangibles. goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. the company has identified global ceramic, flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital ("wacc"), and comparable company market multiples. when developing these key judgments and assumptions, the company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. however, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectations regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted. generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows greater than approximately19% to 39% or an increase of approximately 15% to 45% in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the company are its trademarks, is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. such index to financial statements assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.
the company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. if such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

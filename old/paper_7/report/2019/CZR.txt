management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of these factors and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, but we use our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, retail shops, racing, sportsbook offerings and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of resort fees and complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.

financing and lease transactions
•   add-on notes - on september 13, 2017, we issued an additional $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2025 at an issue price equal to 105.5% of the principal amount. we used the proceeds of the offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaling $78.0 million and used the remainder to repay outstanding borrowings totaling $444.5 million under the term loan plus related accrued interest. we recognized a loss of $11.1 million as a result of the issuance of additional debt and retirement of existing debt for the year ended december 31, 2017.

•   master lease - we accounted for the master lease with glpi as a direct financing obligation effective october 1, 2018. we recorded interest expense in the amount of $98.6 million and 24.4 million during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the master lease.

deferred revenue

•   tsg - the amortization of deferred revenues associated with the tsg agreement totaled $1.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included in corporate and other revenues and operating income.

other significant factors
•   weather and construction disruption - during the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes harvey and irma negatively impacted our south region, specifically our pompano, lake charles and eldorado shreveport properties, and made travel to those properties impossible or difficult. while pompano did not sustain any major physical damage, we incurred incremental expenses as a result of the storms and were forced to close the casino for four days and experienced disruption to our business for a longer period of time.

our west segment's operations are subject to seasonal variation, with our lowest business volume generally occurring during the winter months. the northern nevada region experienced record snowfall and severe weather conditions, including major snow storms during eleven of the fourteen weekends in the 2017 first quarter, making travel to reno from northern california, our main feeder market, difficult or impossible due to road closures. as a result, there was a significant adverse effect on business levels, especially hotel occupancy and gaming volume, during the first quarter of 2017, and our operating performance for the year ended december 31, 2017.
all of our segments were negatively impacted by severe weather, including flooding, during the first half of 2019 compared to the same prior year period. additionally, our south segment was negatively impacted during the third quarter of 2019 due to hurricane and tropical storm activity. our west segment was also negatively impacted by disruption to our casino floor and hotel availability associated with renovation projects at our black hawk property during the construction period from january to june 2019.
•   property enhancement capital expenditures - property enhancement initiatives and targeted investments that improve our guests' experiences and elevate our properties' overall competitiveness in their markets continued throughout 2018 and 2019.

a 118-room hampton inn hotel at scioto downs developed by a third party opened in march 2017 and since opening has driven visitation and spend at the property.
as part of the continuing evolution of the reno tri-properties, we built a new 21,000 square foot spa at silver legacy which opened in early october 2018. we have substantially renovated every room at circus reno and completed the first phase of room renovations at silver legacy and eldorado. we began the second phase of renovations of approximately 1,200 rooms at silver legacy and eldorado in the third quarter of 2019. in black hawk we completed our renovation of all 402 hotel rooms and refresh of the casino floor in june 2019. in addition, our joint venture with cordish continues to make progress on development plans of a new, mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination anchored by our isle casino racing pompano park. at tropicana atlantic city, we opened an expansive, new sportsbook in the fourth quarter of 2018. additionally, during 2019 we added sportsbook offerings at our properties located in iowa, mississippi and indiana. during 2019, we began planning to relocate our lake charles casino operation from our current riverboat to a land-based operation. construction of our new lake charles facility began in february 2020.
•   execution of synergies and cost savings programs - we continue to identify areas to improve property level and consolidated margins through operating and cost efficiencies and exercising financial discipline throughout the company. in addition to cost savings relating to duplicative executive compensation, legal and accounting fees and other corporate expenses that have been eliminated as a result of our acquisitions, we have achieved savings in marketing, food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other operating departments as a result of operating efficiencies and purchasing power of the combined eldorado organization.

52
•   impairment charges - on october 1, 2017 we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets. based on lower than expected operating performance and projected future operating results, it was determined that the value of goodwill and/or trade names associated with our lake charles, vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling $38.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

•   tax cuts and jobs act - on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities, we recorded a decrease of $111.9 million, net of the related change in valuation allowance, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction resulting in a positive impact on net income.

operating results.  including incremental elgin and tropicana net revenues totaling $991.4 million generated following their respective acquisition dates, net revenues increased 23.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of our acquisitions and the divestitures, net revenues decreased 5.1% mainly due to the significant factors described above. this decrease was partially offset by incremental net revenues recognized in conjunction with our william hill and tsg sports betting partnerships for the year ended december 31, 2019.
including incremental isle, elgin and tropicana net revenues totaling $575.5 million generated following their respective acquisition dates, net revenues increased 38.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017. excluding incremental isle, elgin and tropicana net revenues, net revenues remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 2018, operating income increased 32.2% mainly due to incremental operating income contributed by elgin and tropicana following their respective acquisition dates as well as a $49.6 million net gain on sale of businesses and disposal of property and equipment primarily related to the divestitures. this increase was partially offset by incremental transaction expenses associated with our completed and pending acquisitions. excluding the impact of our acquisitions and the divestitures, operating income decreased 15.0% due to higher depreciation expense associated with asset additions and transaction costs associated with the acquisitions of tropicana and caesars. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we received a $5.0 million fee related to the termination of the agreement to purchase our vicksburg property.
for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017, operating income increased 227.1% mainly due to incremental operating income contributed by isle, elgin and tropicana following their respective acquisition dates. incremental operating income totaling $80.7 million represents operating income for four months of operations for isle, five months of operations for elgin and three months of operations for tropicana. excluding the incremental operating income, operating income rose 141.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to margin improvement resulting from synergies and departmental operating efficiencies, a $34.2 million decrease in impairment charges and a $71.9 million decline in transaction expenses. these increases in operating income for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 were partially offset by higher depreciation associated with additional assets.
53
for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 201, net income decreased 14.% principally due to the same factors impacting operating income combined with higher interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 2018 resulting from increased debt associated with the tropicana acquisition and amortization of the direct financing obligation associated with the master lease. additionally, we recorded a $7.5 million loss on the early retirement of debt in 2019 related to the pro-rated write off of deferred financing costs associated with permanent payments on our term loan, and a higher income tax provision due to an increase in our effective tax rate also contributed to the declines in net income. net income was favorably impacted by an $8.8 million unrealized gain on restricted investments for the year ended december 31, 2019.
for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017, net income increased 29.8% due to the same factors impacting operating income combined with the $38.4 million loss on the early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31, 2017 associated with payments on our outstanding debt. these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from increased debt and amortization of the direct financing obligation associated with the master lease following our acquisitions of elgin and tropicana. additionally, the increase in our tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is due to the favorable impact of the tax act in 2017, which resulted in a significant tax benefit recorded in 2017.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 201 and 201
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non-gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. management has historically used adjusted ebitda when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. adjusted ebitda represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the disposition of properties, proceeds from the terminated sale of vicksburg, preopening expenses, costs associated with resolving the historical tropicana bankruptcy, business interruption insurance proceeds, real estate tax settlements, other than temporary impairments on investments, impairment charges, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss on property divestitures, and other non-cash regulatory gaming assessments. adjusted ebitda also excludes expense associated with our master lease with glpi as the transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("us gaap"), is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our master lease, and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.

our cash requirements can fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or divestitures and strategic capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, rent payments under our master lease, continued costs associated with the elgin and tropicana acquisitions and funding the caesars acquisition. pursuant to the a&r commitment letter, the commitment parties committed to arrange and provide the company with: (w) a $1,000.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, (x) a $3,000.0 million senior secured term loan b facility, (y) a $3,250.0 million senior secured 364-day bridge facility and (z) a $1,800.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan facility and (ii) caesars resort collection, llc, a subsidiary of caesars, with a $2,400.0 million senior secured incremental term loan b facility (collectively, the "debt financing"). we expect to fund the anticipated caesars acquisition with a combination of proceeds from the debt financing, the sale-leaseback transactions with vici with respect to harrah's new orleans, harrah's laughlin and harrah's atlantic city, the consideration received from vici received in connection with amendments to the cplv lease and non-cplv lease contemplated by the mta, asset divestitures, existing cash on our balance sheet and cash flow generated by the company and caesars prior to the acquisition. during 2020, we plan to spend approximately $240.0 million on capital expenditures.
we expect that cash generated from operations, borrowings under the debt financing and proceeds from the transactions contemplated by the mta and the announced asset sales, net of associated taxes, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements, consummate the caesars acquisition and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months.
at december 31, 2019, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $206.3 million, excluding restricted cash. at december 31, 2018, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $230.8 million, excluding restricted cash.  this decrease in cash was primarily due to significant payments on our credit facility and investments in capital improvements, which were partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from the divestitures.
operating cash flow.  in 2019, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $312.5 million compared to $323.3 million in 2018. the decrease in operating cash was primarily due to increased transaction costs, which was partially offset by incremental operating cash generated by the acquired elgin and tropicana properties as well as changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
in 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $323.3 million compared to $129.9 million in 2017. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired elgin and tropicana properties and decreased transaction costs combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
investing cash flow and capital expenditures.  net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $369.5 million in 2019 compared to $1.3 billion used in 2018. net cash flows provided by investing activities in 2019 were primarily attributable to $536.1 million in net proceeds from the divestitures. capital expenditures totaled $170.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 related to growth and maintenance capital projects.
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. net cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 were primarily due to $307.3 million cash paid in the elgin acquisition and $806.0 million cash paid in the tropicana acquisition. additionally, capital expenditures totaled $147.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 related to growth and maintenance capital projects.
financing cash flow.  net cash used in financing activities in 2019 totaled $712.2 million and was principally due to $278.0 million of net payments under our revolving credit facility and $458.0 million of payments on the term loan.
net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 totaled $1.0 billion and was principally due to $600.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 6.0% senior notes due 2026 in conjunction with the tropicana acquisition, $246.0 million of proceeds from the lumière loan (defined below) and $245.0 million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility related to the elgin acquisition.

income taxes.  the company will pay approximately $28.0 million in cash taxes in 2020 related to the gain on the sales of mountaineer, cape girardeau and caruthersville in addition to cash taxes related to the company's operations, subject to any changes as a result of the merger. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the company made cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaling $51.1 million, of which $42.7 million, net of refunds, was related to taxes owed in conjunction with the tropicana acquisition and sale of presque.

(1)   these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters.

(2)   estimated interest payments on long-term debt are based on libor rates and principal amounts outstanding on the credit facility at december 31, 2019.

(3)   our operating lease obligations are described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

(4)   includes any construction or other contracts which are not operating or capital leases.

(5)   pompano is required to pay minimum purses of $7.75 million per race year per the terms of the agreement with the horsemen, which expires on may 21, 2020.

(6)   in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain stockholders of scioto downs elected the option to receive cash and contingent earn‐out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten-year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.

(7)   the master lease annual estimated payments consist of building base rent totaling $60.9 million, land base rent totaling $13.4 million and variable rent totaling $13.4 million. the building base rent includes an annual 2% escalation.

the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31, 2019, for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown, or contractual agreements have not been executed, or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon.
the repayment of our long‐term debt, which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the 6% senior notes due 2025, 6% senior notes due 2026, 7% senior notes due 2023 and the credit facility, is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations.
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation
68
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factors-risks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.
business combinations we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations," in the accounting for our acquisitions of isle, elgin, tropicana and our previous acquisitions. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of their respective acquisition dates were measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of the fair value of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties' estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles were the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses, respectively.
casino revenue and pari-mutuel commissions the company recognizes net win from gaming activities as casino revenue, which is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. gaming revenues are recognized net of certain cash and free play incentives. pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. the company recognizes revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made and are recorded on a gross basis. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks.
non-gaming revenue hotel, food and beverage, and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed. the revenue for hotel, food and beverage contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. hotel, food and beverage services have been determined to be separate, stand-alone performance obligations and the transaction price for
69
such contracts is recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer's stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage. advance deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contracts are recorded as deferred income until the revenue recognition criteria has been met. the company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations, such as for packages, for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each service's stand-alone selling price.
complimentaries the company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program. the retail value of complimentary food, beverage, hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction of revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and revenue for the department redeemed. complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the company is recorded as an expense when incurred.
for information with respect to our adoption of asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," (topic 606) effective january 1, 2018, see "note 2, summary of significant accounting policies - recently issued accounting pronouncements," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the "more likely than not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management analyzes all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‐likely‐than‐not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‐recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
property and equipment and other long‐lived assets property and equipment are recorded at cost, except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805, and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
70
property, equipment and other long‐lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment. we evaluate our long‐lived assets for impairment issues whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received or a discounted cash flow model. as a result of the agreement to sell nemacolin, an impairment charge of $3.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 was recorded to property and equipment due to the carrying value of net property and equipment being sold exceeding net sales proceeds. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any long-lived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31, 201 and 2017.
for undeveloped properties, including non‐operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as a result of the sale of certain non-operating real property located in pennsylvania, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.
goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we utilize the option to perform a step zero analysis for each of our reporting units and if we conclude it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units are less than their carrying values, then we utilize the two-step quantitative analysis for such reporting units. as a result of our annual impairment tests, none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018. for our 2017 annual impairment tests, we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units were less than their carrying values and as a result of the two-step quantitative analysis performed in 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $34.9 million and $3.1 million related to goodwill and trade names, respectively. in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg's operations as assets held for sale at march 31, 2018, an impairment charge totaling $9.8 million to goodwill was recorded.
our indefinite‐lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review.
the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property.
we value trade names using the relief‐from‐royalty method with royalty rates range from 0.5% ‐ 1.0%. trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a 3.5-year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of tropicana, elgin, isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized (deemed indefinite-lived).
71
the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a one- to five-year useful life.
assessing goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business‐specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
self‐insurance reserves we are self‐insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements' opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers' compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets. self‐insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
player loyalty programs we offer programs at our properties whereby participating customers can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and, in limited situations, cash. the incentives earned by customers under these programs are based on previous revenue transactions and represent separate performance obligations. points earned, less estimated breakage, are recorded as a reduction of casino revenues at the standalone selling price of the points when earned based upon the retail value of the benefits, historical redemption rates and estimated breakage and recognized as departmental revenue based on where such points are redeemed upon fulfillment of the performance obligation. the loyalty program liability represents a deferral of revenue until redemption occurs, which is typically less than one year.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.

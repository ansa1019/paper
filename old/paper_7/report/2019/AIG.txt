throughout the md&a, we use certain terms and abbreviations, which are summarized in the glossary and acronyms.
we have incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this annual report to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.
42 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures use of non-gaap measures in item 1. business, item 6. selected financial data and throughout this md&a, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. some of the measurements we use are "non-gaap financial measures" under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations. gaap is the acronym for "generally accepted accounting principles" in the united states. the non-gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) and book value per common share, excluding aoci and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. book value per common share, excluding aoci, is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders' equity, excluding aoci, by total common shares outstanding. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders' equity, excluding aoci and dta (adjusted common shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding. the reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
return on common equity - adjusted after-tax income excluding aoci and dta (adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity. adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders' equity. the reconciliation to return on common equity, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (apti) adjustments described below, dividends on preferred stock, and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig:
deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;
changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and
net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act);
and by excluding the net realized capital gains (losses) from noncontrolling interests.
we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. when we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md&a.
adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes). adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments.

table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our segments. these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. apti is a gaap measure for our segments. beginning in the first quarter of 2019, on a prospective basis, the changes in the fair value of equity securities are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income (loss). excluded items include the following:
changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), value of business acquired (voba), and sales inducement assets (sia) related to net realized capital gains and losses;changes in the fair value of equity securities;loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;all net realized capital gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized capital gains and losses to specific apti line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances); income or loss from discontinued operations;net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);   pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees;income and loss from divested businesses; non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses;losses from the impairment of goodwill; andnon-recurring external costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles.

general insurance
-ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of $10 million each and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.
life and retirement
-premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, federal home loan bank (fhlb) funding agreements and mutual funds.
results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.
44 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:

loss reserves;valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition;valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products;valuation of embedded derivatives for fixed index annuity and life products;estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products;reinsurance assets;impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, allowances for loan losses, and goodwill impairment;liability for legal contingencies;fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; andincome tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and estimates associated with the tax act.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
insurance liabilities loss reserves the estimate of the loss reserves relies on several key judgments:
the determination of the actuarial models used as the basis for these estimates;
the relative weights given to these models by product line;
the underlying assumptions used in these models; and
the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.
we use numerous assumptions in determining the best estimate of reserves for each line of business. the importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. this is particularly true for long-tail classes of business.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates overview of loss reserving process and methods our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. short-tail reserves consists principally of u.s. property and special risks, europe property and special risks, u.s. personal insurance, and europe and japan personal insurance. long-tail reserves include u.s. workers' compensation, u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, u.s. financial lines, europe casualty and financial lines, and u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines.
short-tail reserves for our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining ibnr based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. for example, the ibnr reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter's earned premiums. this level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. the percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. the expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. the expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. for more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the ibnr. for other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine ibnr reserves. ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department's knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.
for our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:

loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2019 for the year-end 2019 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. for low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers' compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
46 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. for most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
details of the loss reserving process the process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. these include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. at the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. this process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. when this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.
we conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
the reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. in the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
for certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
we consult with third-party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third-party toxic tort claims professionals, third-party clinical and public health specialists, third-party workers' compensation claims adjusters and third-party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management group.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we consider key factors in performing detailed actuarial reviews, including:

an assessment of economic conditions including inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration;changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment including changes in road safety, public health and cleanup standards;changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) and wage inflation trends;underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions including attachment points and policy limits; changes in claims handling philosophy, operating model, processes and related ongoing enhancements; third-party claims reviews that are periodically performed for key product lines such as toxic tort, environmental and other complex casualty;third-party actuarial reviews that are periodically performed for key product lines of business;input from underwriters on pricing, terms, and conditions and market trends; andchanges in our reinsurance program, pricing and commutations.
actuarial and other methods for major lines of business our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. while for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod", and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. for example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. we continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. for example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. under the bornhuetter ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. for example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. the actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. in the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. the result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. if the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the bornhuetter ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. thus, the bornhuetter ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. in the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.
48 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
the cape cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. a structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. for example, for the excess workers' compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker's medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:
claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third-party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker's indemnity and medical benefits;
analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker's lifetime;
analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;
portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers' compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;
ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and
the effects of various run-off loss management strategies that have been developed by our run-off unit.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates in recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. for example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers' compensation business. using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.
the majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.

u.s. workers'          we generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for u.s. workers' compensation as this line of business is long-tail. the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. this is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year's reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers' compensation business.
compensation the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. for example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review. for excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review.

u.s. excess casualty                                                     we utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2019 loss reserve review for u.s. excess casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter-ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.
u.s. other casualty                                                      the key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. these may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.
u.s. financial lines                                                     the loss cost trends for u.s. directors and officers (d&amp;o) liability business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review. because u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter-ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.the selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to u.s. excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review.
europe casualty and financial lines                                      similar to u.s. business, european casualty and financial lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. the variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region.
u.s. property and special risks, and europe property and special risks   for short-tail lines such as property and special risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. these outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.
u.s. personal insurance, and europe, and japan personal insurance        personal insurance is short-tailed in nature similar to property and special risks but less volatile. variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. in addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.

u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines   we historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers' compensation and other run-off segments. for environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics. u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. specifically for excess workers' compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review.
other reserve items                      loss adjustment expenses (lae) are separated into two broad categories: allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or "legal" and unallocated loss adjustment expenses, which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.we determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. for the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. for segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. the development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.the bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. for these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. for other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.the incidence of lae is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. as a result, a key driver of variability in lae is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.
the following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2019:

52 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.
for long-duration traditional business, a "lock-in" principle applies. the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. the assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. the extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.
loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. to determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. if loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing dac through amortization expense, and, if dac is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the "lock-in" principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. in particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.
for additional information on loss recognition see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:
to determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. a critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. for products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. for the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.
for mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. the latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by aig's actuaries and published industry information.
for surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. to support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.
for in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. in establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a low interest rate environment may cause dac to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income ("shadow loss recognition"). these charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. in applying shadow loss recognition, the company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.

the liability for gmdb, which is recorded in future policyholder benefits, represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. the liabilities for gmwb, which are recorded in policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in other realized capital gains (losses).
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime). a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.

key assumptions include:mortality rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy formlapse rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy forminvestment returns, using assumptions from a stochastic equity model in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of the gmdb liability, we use a reversion to the mean methodology, similar to that applied for dac. for a description of this methodology see estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products below.
gmwb                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             gmwb living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, and for information on fair value measurement of these embedded derivatives, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. key assumptions include:interest ratesequity market returnsmarket volatilitycredit spreadsequity / interest rate correlationpolicyholder behavior, including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization. estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experiencein applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of gmwbs, we use market-consistent assumptions calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option pricesallocation of fees between the embedded derivative and host contract valuation of embedded derivatives for fixed index annuity and life products fixed index annuity and life products provide growth potential based in part on the performance of a market index. certain fixed index annuity products offer optional guaranteed benefit features similar to those offered on variable annuity products. the index crediting feature of these products results in the recognition of an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future equity index growth rates, volatility of the equity index, future interest rates, and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on equity indexed credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions.

estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. estimated gross profits include current and expected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. for fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change, dac and related reserves, including voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (urr), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
in estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of december 31, 2019, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. in determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. the reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or "unlock" the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.
for additional discussion see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - dac - reversion to the mean.

the analysis of dac, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits, and unearned revenue reserve is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. we estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions. an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. the effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit embedded derivative liabilities.

reinsurance assets the estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.
we assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. we record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. this estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:
paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;
whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;
whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and
whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.
at december 31, 2019, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $111 million, or less than one percent of the consolidated reinsurance recoverable.
risk transfer all insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, must meet risk transfer requirements in order to use insurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, all insurance and reinsurance contracts must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk; in addition, reinsurance contracts must also include a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our general insurance companies, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance and are therefore subject to deposit accounting.
for additional information on reinsurance see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment charges impairments of investments at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. we also evaluate our other invested assets for impairment; these include equity method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities as well as investments in real estate and life settlements.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates an allowance is typically established for the difference between the impaired value of a loan and its current carrying amount. additional allowance amounts are established for incurred but not specifically identified impairments, based on statistical models primarily driven by past due status, debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, property type and location, loan term, profile of the borrower and of the major property tenants, and loan seasoning.
for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by investment type, that we use to determine the amount of impairment and allowances for loan losses see the discussion in notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment for a discussion of goodwill impairment see part i, item 1a. risk factors - estimates and assumptions and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. in 2019, 2018 and 2017, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. to determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. such analysis is principally based on our business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.
liability for legal contingencies we estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from regulatory and government investigations and actions and litigation and other forms of dispute resolution to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. in many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. given the inherent unpredictability of such matters, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

58 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.
we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.
for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as a discussion of transfers of level 3 assets and liabilities see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. the more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.
we consider a number of factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses, foreign tax credits, realized capital loss and other carryforwards. these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events. we subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. we have also considered the impact of the tax act on our forecasts of taxable income, made certain assumptions related to interpretation of relevant new rules, and incorporated guidance issued by the u.s. tax authority. our analysis also reflects the effect of slower utilization of our tax credits due to a reduction in the u.s. statutory tax rate as a result of the tax act. our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the u.s. tax attributes prior to their expiration.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, recent changes in market conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, impacted the unrealized tax gains and losses in the u.s. non-life companies' available for sale securities portfolio, resulting in an increase to the deferred tax liability related to net unrealized tax capital gains. as of december 31, 2019, we continue to be in an overall unrealized tax gain position with respect to the u.s. non-life companies' available for sale securities portfolio and thus concluded no valuation allowance is necessary in the u.s. non-life companies' available for sale securities portfolio.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, recent changes in market conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, impacted the unrealized tax gains and losses in the u.s. life insurance companies' available for sale securities portfolio, resulting in a deferred tax liability related to net unrealized tax capital gains. as of december 31, 2019, based on all available evidence, we concluded that no valuation allowance is required.
for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
uncertain tax positions our accounting for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions, represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, and requires judgment. fasb interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes" now incorporated into accounting standards codification, 740, income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement.
we classify interest expense and penalties recognized on income taxes as a component of income taxes.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates u.s. income taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between the book carrying amounts and tax bases of subsidiaries are complex. determining the amount also requires significant judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates.
u.s. tax reform on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted public law 115-97, known informally as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act). the tax act reduced the statutory rate of u.s. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting aig and the insurance industry.
the tax act includes a provision for gilti under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for beat under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. while the u.s. tax authorities issued formal guidance, including recently issued proposed and final regulations for beat and other provisions of the tax act, there are still certain aspects of the tax act that remain unclear and subject to substantial uncertainties. additional guidance is expected in future periods. such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the tax act, possibly materially. consistent with accounting guidance, we treat beat as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat gilti taxes in a similar manner.
for an additional discussion of the tax act see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

general operating and other expenses(in millions)

general operating and other expenses declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower employee related expenses and professional fee reductions pertaining to expense reduction initiatives. the declines were partially offset by an increase in expenses caused by the acquisitions of validus and glatfelter in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. general operating and other expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of validus, business growth and continued investments in business platforms. in keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $218 million, $395 million and $413 million, respectively, of pre-tax restructuring and other costs which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges and other exit costs related to organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization.

aig's outlook - industry and economic factors our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2019, characterized by factors such as the impact of historically low interest rates, slowing global economic growth, global trade tensions and the uk's pending withdrawal from its membership in the european union (the eu) (commonly referred to as brexit). brexit has also affected the u.s. dollar/british pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, british pound and the japanese yen (the major currencies), which may continue for some time.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment while many benchmark u.s. interest rates had risen to recent period highs in 2018, more recent concerns about global trade and potential weakness in u.s. economic expansion led to declining interest rates in 2019, with key benchmark rates in the u.s. and in many developed markets close to historic lows and, in some international jurisdictions, negative. the low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and negatively impacts the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. on the other hand, if rates rise, some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts, some of which are highlighted below. we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.
64 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary additionally, sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting of projected benefit cash flows.
annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. however, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-five year range, in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting, tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.
reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. a low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. in addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.
the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.
for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see investments.
for investment-oriented products in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. as interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment.
of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products, 65 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at december 31, 2019. the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 61 percent and 66 percent at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. in the core universal life business in our life insurance business, 63 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at december 31, 2019.

general insurance the impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail casualty line of business. we expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. however, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.
in addition, for our general insurance segment and general insurance run-off lines reported within the legacy portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.
standard of care developments in our life and retirement business, we and our distributors are subject to laws and regulations regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers. in recent years, many of these laws and regulations have been revised or reexamined while others have been newly adopted. we continue to closely follow these legislative and regulatory activities. for additional information regarding these legislative and regulatory activities, see item 1. business - regulation - u.s. regulation - standard of care developments. changes in standard of care requirements or new standards issued by governmental authorities, such as the dol, the sec, the naic or state regulators and/or legislators, may affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. while we cannot predict the long-term impact of these legislative and regulatory developments on our life and retirement businesses, we believe our diverse product offerings and distribution relationships position us to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace.

(a)includes all net realized capital gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication.
(b)noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the 19.9 percent investment in fortitude holdings by an affiliate of carlyle, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. carlyle is allocated 19.9 percent of fortitude holdings' standalone financial results. fortitude holdings' results are mostly eliminated in aig's consolidated income from continuing operations given that its results arise from intercompany transactions. noncontrolling interests is calculated based on the standalone financial results of fortitude holdings. the most significant component of fortitude holdings' standalone results includes the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives, which moved materially in the year due to lower rates and tightening credit spreads, and which are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses of fortitude holdings. in accordance with aig's adjusted after-tax income definition, realized capital gains and losses are excluded from noncontrolling interests.

pre-tax income comparison for 2019 and 2018
pre-tax income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to:
improvement in accident year losses in general insurance as a result of underwriting discipline, increased use of reinsurance and a change in business mix as well as lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year loss reserve development compared to unfavorable loss reserve development in the prior year in general insurance;
higher investment returns in our alternative investments portfolio due to robust equity market returns in 2019, income from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio, and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected. this compares to lower returns in the prior year as a result of an increase in interest rates and widening credit spreads that occurred, lower hedge fund performance, as well as negative performance of our fair value option equity securities portfolio;
net realized capital gains in 2019 compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year due to gains on the sales of securities and foreign exchange compared to losses on sales of securities and foreign exchange in 2018, as well as lower impairments in 2019 and losses on private equity sales in 2018. partially offsetting these gains were derivative losses in 2019 compared to gains in 2018; and
lower general and other operating expenses as a result of ongoing strategic initiatives to reduce costs.
these increases were partially offset by:
a net loss reserve discount charge in 2019 compared to a loss reserve discount benefit in the prior year.
pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2018 and 2017
pre-tax income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to:
lower investment returns primarily driven by lower hedge fund performance, a decline in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected compared to higher returns on this portfolio in 2017 as a result of significant spread tightening that occurred, losses on our fair value option equities portfolio, and lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico late in the first quarter of 2017;
a net unfavorable adjustment from the review and update of life and retirement actuarial assumptions compared to a net favorable adjustment in the prior year; and
higher general operating and other expenses due to the acquisition of validus, business growth and continued investments in business platforms.
partially offset by:
lower losses incurred from general insurance operations driven by significantly lower catastrophe losses and lower unfavorable prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by higher severe losses; and
lower net realized capital losses due to:
-life and retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, which reflected net realized capital gains in 2018 compared to net realized capital losses in 2017, primarily due to changes in the movement in the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment (npa), which is not hedged as part of our economic hedging program (see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results);
70 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations
-partially offset by losses on the sale of securities in 2018 due to a decline in the credit and equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to gains in the prior year.
u.s. tax reform overview on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted public law 115-97, known informally as the tax act. the tax act reduced the statutory rate of u.s. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting aig and the insurance industry. changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. provisions of the tax act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. these provisions, generally, result in an increase in aig's taxable income.
the tax act includes provisions for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) under which taxes are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. while the u.s. tax authorities issued formal guidance, including recently issued proposed and final regulations for beat and other provisions of the tax act, there are still certain aspects of the tax act that remain unclear and subject to substantial uncertainties. additional guidance is expected in future periods. such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the tax act, possibly materially. consistent with accounting guidance, we treat beat as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat gilti taxes in a similar manner.
repatriation assumptions as a result of the tax act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the gilti or subpart f regimes) will generally be exempt from u.s. tax upon repatriation. notwithstanding the changes, u.s. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-u.s. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. for 2019, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in canada, south africa, the far east, latin america, bermuda as well as the european, asia pacific and middle east regions to be indefinitely reinvested. these earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-u.s. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.
income tax expense analysis for the year ended december 31, 2019, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 22.1 percent. the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to:
tax charges of:
-$96 million net charge primarily related to the accrual of irs interest (including interest related to uncertain tax positions),
-$82 million associated with the effect of foreign operations,
-$37 million of tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions primarily related to open tax issues and audits in state and local jurisdictions
-$27 million of excess tax charges related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement; and
-$15 million of non-deductible transfer pricing charges;
partially offset by tax benefits of:
-$113 million of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities,
-$65 million of tax exempt income, and
-$44 million of valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and state jurisdictions.
the effect of foreign operations is primarily related to income and losses in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates different than 21 percent and foreign income subject to u.s. taxation.

table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 59.9 percent. the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to:
tax charges of:
-$83 million net charge primarily related to the accrual of irs interest (including interest related to uncertain tax positions),
-$62 million measurement period adjustment related to the deemed repatriation tax,
-$44 million associated with the effect of foreign operations,
-$21 million of additional u.s. taxes imposed on income of our foreign subsidiaries under international provisions of the tax act,
-$21 million valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and state jurisdictions, and
-$29 million of non-deductible transfer pricing charges;
partially offset by tax benefits of:
-$72 million of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities,
-$37 million of tax exempt income, and
-$13 million of excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement.
the effect of foreign operations is primarily related to income and losses in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates different than 21 percent and foreign income subject to u.s. taxation.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was not meaningful. the effective tax rate differs from the 2017 statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to:
tax charges of:
-$6.7 billion associated with the enactment of the tax act discussed above,
-$660 million of tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions primarily related to cross border financing transactions and other open tax issues,
-$69 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and
-$35 million of non-deductible transfer pricing charges;
partially offset by tax benefits of:
-$201 million of tax exempt income,
-$184 million of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, and
-$40 million of excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with relevant accounting literature.
the effect of foreign operations is primarily related to losses incurred in our european operations taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent and other foreign taxes.

74 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | general insurance competition and challenges operating in a highly competitive industry, general insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the u.s. in international markets, we compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. general insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.
we serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.
our challenges include:
long-tail commercial lines exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management;
over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;
tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and
volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.
outlook-industry and economic factors below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:
general insurance - north america commercial lines over recent years has experienced challenging market conditions, with widespread excess capacity increasing competition and suppressing rates across multiple classes of business. however, in more recent periods we are seeing growing market support for rate increases in challenged segments where major carriers are reducing their risk appetite and market capacity is contracting as a result. we are seeing rate increases across u.s. financial lines and liability segments (outside of workers' compensation), with a common driver being higher industry-wide claims severity trends, as well as within our property and specialty portfolios. we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and classes of business as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. further, we continue to achieve growth in several of our commercial lines high margin businesses, although these market segments remain highly competitive.
personal insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. we compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.
general insurance - international we believe our global presence provides commercial lines and personal insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships.
the commercial lines market continues to be highly competitive, due to increased market capacity and ample availability of capital. despite this, we continue to grow our most profitable segments and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding into new product lines (e.g., cyber), new client segments (e.g., middle market) and new distribution channels (e.g., digital and national brokers) while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. overall, commercial lines are showing positive rate increases in selective products and markets where market events or withdrawal of capability have favorably impacted pricing. we are maintaining our underwriting discipline, reducing gross and net limits, increasing use of reinsurance to reduce volatility, as well as continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability.
personal insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. although market competition within personal insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and generally low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines, although some product classes are exposed to catastrophe losses.

business and financial highlights the north america general insurance business is focused on making progress towards improved underwriting results and efficiencies. this includes strengthening our talent base; ongoing investment in pricing and monitoring tools; managing limits on both a gross and net basis with enhanced focus on portfolio management and individual business strategy; and increased use of reinsurance to reduce volatility.
we recorded adjusted pre-tax income in 2019 compared to an adjusted pre-tax loss in the prior year, primarily due to lower loss ratio, higher net investment income and lower general operating expenses as a result of ongoing efforts to reduce expenses. the loss ratio decreased due to lower catastrophe losses, favorable prior year loss reserve development compared to unfavorable loss reserve development in the prior year and lower current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted.
net premiums written increased in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of the validus and glatfelter acquisitions as well as growth within the validus business, partially offset by underwriting actions taken to reposition our portfolio and to maintain pricing discipline and higher ceded premiums due to the changes in 2019 reinsurance programs.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement competition and challenges life and retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the u.s. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including banks and other life insurance and mutual fund companies. competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.
our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.
our primary challenges include:
a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;
increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and competitors with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space as well as other product lines;
increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth and costs; and
upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.
outlook-industry and economic factors below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:
individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for individual index and fixed deferred annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. in response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for variable, fixed index, and fixed deferred annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.
changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.
group retirement group retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the aig retirement services brand. aig retirement services is a leading retirement plan provider in the u.s. for k-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. the defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. to meet this challenge, aig retirement services is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. aig retirement services' model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.
changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.
88 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement life insurance consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.
in response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our life insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with lower long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.
as life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the u.s. and the uk, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. the industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.
institutional markets institutional markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. we expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.
changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities.

business and financial highlights the market environment continues to reflect uncertainties in the annuity business resulting from a sustained low interest rate environment. interest rates declined in 2019 and are near historical lows. excluding prior year deposits from fhlb funding agreements, premiums and deposits increased in 2019 compared to the prior year. net flows in 2019 remained negative but improved compared to the prior year primarily due to higher deposits driven by increased fixed and index annuities sales, offset by lower sales for the variable annuities and retail mutual funds. premiums and deposits improved in 2018 compared to 2017. premiums and deposits in 2018 included deposits from fhlb funding agreements. net flows in 2018 deteriorated compared to 2017 and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders and withdrawals, mainly in retail mutual funds.
adjusted pre-tax income increased in 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by decreases in variable annuity dac amortization and reserves due to stronger equity market performances, growth in income from base portfolio due to higher invested assets, higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, and prior year dac and reserve model adjustments. partially offsetting these increases were lower variable annuity policy and advisory fee income, net of expenses due to variable annuity and retail mutual fund negative net flows. adjusted pre-tax income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of decreased fixed annuity base spread income primarily due to lower reinvestment yields and decreased gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, and higher variable annuity dac amortization and reserves due to lower equity market performance. partially offsetting these decreases were higher policy and advisory fees, and increased base spread income for index annuities.
90 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement individual retirement adjusted pre-tax income(in millions)

2019 and 2018 comparison adjusted pre-tax income increased primarily due to:higher net investment returns including growth in income from base net investment spread due to higher invested assets, driven by increased sales, higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, and income from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio, partially offset by lower affordable housing returns, and prior-year non-recurring payments on structured securities; andstronger equity market performance, which contributed to decreases in variable annuity dac amortization and reserves, prior year dac and reserve model adjustment, and lower fixed annuity dac amortization due to lower surrenders, partially offset by higher index annuity dac amortization and reserves driven by growth in sales and dac model adjustments.partially offsetting these increases were:lower policy and advisory fee income net of expenses due to negative variable annuity and retail mutual fund net flows and a decrease in variable annuity and retail mutual fund average aum related to the equity market decline at the end of 2018.
individual retirement adjusted pre-tax income(in millions)

2018 and 2017 comparison adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:a net unfavorable adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions of $52 million in 2018, compared to a net favorable adjustment of $242 million in the prior year;a decline in net investment income, primarily from lower gains on fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected when compared to 2017 where returns were higher as a result of significant spread tightening that occurred and lower bond call and tender income;a decline in fixed annuity base spread income primarily driven by lower reinvestment yields and volumes; andhigher variable annuity dac amortization and reserves due to lower equity market performance.partially offsetting these decreases were: higher index annuity base portfolio income reflecting growth in assets from increased sales; andhigher policy fees primarily driven by asset growth in index and variable annuities.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement individual retirement gaap premiums, premiums and deposits, surrenders and net flows for individual retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. premiums increased in 2019 compared to the prior year. premiums decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased market rates competition.
premiums and deposits is a non-gaap financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, fhlb funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.
net flows for annuity products in individual retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. deposits from fhlb funding agreements were excluded from net flows of individual retirement, as net flows from these funding agreements are not considered part of the metric to measure individual retirement's core recurring performance.

individual retirement annuities are typically subject to a four- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. for fixed annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charge at december 31, 2019 has increased compared to december 31, 2018 due to improved net flows driven by higher fixed annuity sales, combined with fewer policyholders reaching the end of the surrender charge period in 2019 compared to 2018. the increase in reserves with no surrender charge for variable and index annuities at december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 is due to normal aging of business.

business and financial highlights group retirement is focused on implementing initiatives to grow its business. however, external factors, including increased competition and the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in target markets, continue to impact group retirement's customer retention. excluding deposits from fhlb funding agreement, premiums and deposits decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year. net flows remained negative but improved in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower surrenders partially offset by decreased deposits. premiums and deposits increased in 2018 compared to 2017. premiums and deposits in 2018 included deposits from fhlb funding agreement. net flows deteriorated in 2018 compared to 2017 and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders, partially offset by increased premiums and deposits in 2018.
adjusted pre-tax income remained relatively flat in 2019 compared to the prior year. the slight increase was primarily driven by an increase in base net investment spread primarily due to higher average invested assets, lower variable annuity dac amortization and reserves due to stronger equity market performance and higher investment returns in our alternative investment portfolio due to gains from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio in the second quarter of 2019 and gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. partially offsetting these increases were higher general operating expenses, prior year receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities, and a net unfavorable adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net favorable adjustment in the prior year. adjusted pre-tax income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increases in general operating expenses and higher variable annuity dac amortization and reserves due to lower equity market performance partially offset by higher policy fees and net investment income.

(b)beginning in the first quarter of 2019, on a prospective basis, within other operations, investment income from our non-insurance subsidiaries is reported in net investment income instead of other income to align reporting with general insurance and life and retirement reporting segments. the impact of this reclassification for the twelve-months ended december 31, 2019 was $262 million. for the twelve-months ended december 31, 2018, the amount included in other income was $165 million.
(c)interest expense-other primarily represents interest expense on consolidated investment entities of $158 million, $11 million and $0 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and costs of derivatives used to economically hedge foreign denominated debt of $37 million, $34 million and $0 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
2019 and 2018 comparison adjusted pre-tax loss increased primarily due to:
higher corporate general operating expenses due to higher compensation and technology costs; and
higher interest expenses driven by corporate debt issuances in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, and debt associated with consolidated investment entities.
the increase in adjusted pre-tax loss was partially offset by:
higher net investment income associated with consolidated investment entities.

2018 and 2017 comparison blackboard began operations in 2018 and fuji life was sold on april 30, 2017. excluding these results, adjusted pre-tax loss increased primarily due to:
higher interest expense due to corporate debt issuances totaling $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018; and
lower other income as a result of income on securities for which we elected the fair value option and available for sale investments.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | legacy portfolio legacy portfolio legacy portfolio represents exited or discontinued product lines, policy forms or distribution channels. effective february 2018, our bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, fortitude re, is included in our legacy portfolio.
legacy life and retirement run-off lines - reserves consist of certain structured settlements, pension risk transfer annuities and single premium immediate annuities written prior to april 2012. also includes exposures to whole life, long-term care and exited accident & health product lines.
legacy general insurance run-off lines - reserves consist of excess workers' compensation, environmental exposures and exposures to other products within general insurance that are no longer actively marketed. also includes the remaining reserves in eaglestone reinsurance company (eaglestone).
legacy investments - includes investment classes that we have placed into run-off including holdings in direct investments as well as investments in global capital markets and global real estate.
business strategy for legacy insurance lines, securing the interests of our policyholders and insureds is paramount. we have considered and continue to evaluate the following strategies for these lines:
•third-party and affiliated reinsurance and retrocessions to improve capital efficiency.
•commutations of assumed reinsurance and direct policy buy-backs.
•enhanced insured policyholder options and claims resolution strategies.
•enhanced asset liability management and expense management.
for legacy investments, our business strategy is to maximize liquidity to aig parent and minimize book value impairments while sourcing for our insurance companies attractive assets for their portfolios.
sale of fortitude holdings fortitude re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions related to our legacy portfolio. those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our legacy insurance run-off lines into a single legal entity. as of december 31, 2019, the affiliated transactions included the cession of approximately $30.2 billion of reserves from our legacy life and retirement run-off lines and approximately $3.9 billion of reserves from our legacy general insurance run-off lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned aig subsidiaries. fortitude re has approximately $2.5 billion of total assets after elimination of intercompany balances, primarily managed by aig, and is aig's main run-off reinsurer with its own dedicated management team. in the second quarter of 2018, we formed fortitude holdings to act as a holding company for fortitude re.
on november 13, 2018, aig completed the sale of a 19.9 percent ownership interest in fortitude holdings to tcg, an affiliate of carlyle. upon completion of the 2018 fortitude sale, fortitude holdings owned 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of fortitude re and aig had an 80.1 percent ownership interest in fortitude holdings. aig received $381 million in cash and will receive up to $95 million of deferred compensation which is subject to certain purchase price adjustments. to the extent aig does not receive all or a portion of the planned distributions within 18 months of the 2018 fortitude sale, tcg will pay us up to an additional $100 million. in connection with the 2018 fortitude sale, we agreed to certain investment commitment targets into various carlyle strategies and to certain minimum investment management fee payments within thirty-six months following the closing. aig also will be required to pay a proportionate amount of an agreed make-whole fee to the extent we fail to satisfy such investment commitment targets.
on november 25, 2019, aig entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with fortitude holdings, carlyle, carlyle frl, t&d and t&d holdings, inc., pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, carlyle frl will purchase from aig a 51.6 percent ownership interest in fortitude holdings and t&d will purchase from aig a 25 percent ownership interest in fortitude holdings. upon closing of the 2019 fortitude sale, aig will have a 3.5 percent ownership interest in fortitude holdings. in connection with the 2019 fortitude sale agreement, aig, fortitude holdings and an affiliate of carlyle frl have agreed that, effective as of the closing of the 2019 fortitude sale, (i) aig's aforementioned investment commitment targets will be assumed by fortitude holdings and aig will be released therefrom, and (ii) carlyle will remain obligated to pay aig $95 million of deferred compensation and up to an additional $100 million to the extent aig does not receive all or a portion of the planned
106 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | legacy portfolio distributions within 18 months of the closing of the 2018 fortitude sale. we expect to contribute approximately $1.45 billion of the proceeds of the 2019 fortitude sale to certain of our insurance company subsidiaries for a period of time following the closing of the transaction. there can be no guarantee that we will receive the required regulatory approvals or that closing conditions will be satisfied in order to consummate the 2019 fortitude sale.
the affiliated reinsurance transactions executed in the first quarter of 2018 with fortitude re resulted in prepaid insurance assets on the ceding subsidiaries' balance sheets of approximately $2.5 billion (after-tax) and related deferred acquisition costs of $0.5 billion (after-tax) at inception of the contract. the prepaid insurance assets have been eliminated in aig's consolidated financial statements since the counterparties were wholly owned.
upon closing of the 2019 fortitude sale, aig will recognize a loss for the portion of the unamortized balance of these assets that are not recoverable, if any, when we are no longer a controlling shareholder in fortitude holdings. as of december 31, 2019, the unamortized balances of the aforementioned prepaid insurance assets and related deferred acquisition costs were $2.3 billion (after-tax) and $0.4 billion (after-tax), respectively. this combined loss of $2.7 billion would be incremental to any gain or loss recognized on the 2019 fortitude sale. the incremental gain or loss we will recognize on the 2019 fortitude sale would be impacted, perhaps significantly, by market conditions existing at the time the 2019 fortitude sale closes.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | legacy portfolio business and financial highlights legacy insurance lines, including those ceded to fortitude re, continue to run-off as anticipated for legacy general insurance and legacy life and retirement run-off lines. legacy investments have been reduced significantly over the last several years declining from $6.7 billion at december 31, 2016 to $2.0 billion at december 31, 2019. the remaining legacy investments primarily include structured credit junior notes for which we have elected the fair value option and real estate investments.
legacy portfolio adjusted pre-tax income(in millions)

2019 and 2018 comparisonadjusted pre-tax income increased due to: higher legacy life and retirement earnings due to an increase in net investment income and a decrease in policyholder benefits and losses incurred due to non-recurring loss recognition incurred on accident and health business (other than long-term care) in 2018.higher legacy investment earnings due to an increase in gains on fair value option portfolioslegacy general insurance earnings in 2019 were consistent compared to 2018.
legacy portfolio adjusted pre-tax income(in millions)

2018 and 2017 comparison adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to: lower legacy life and retirement earnings compared to 2017 due to lower net investment income and loss recognition from the update to actuarial assumptions in 2018 of $105 million mainly attributable to higher claims costs on the cancer products portfolio;lower legacy general insurance earnings compared to 2017 due to lower net investment income, japanese catastrophe losses in 2018 and a change in premium earning patterns on certain environmental business in 2018; and legacy investment earnings compared to 2017 due to continued dispositions of non- insurance investment assets, primarily driven by the sale of the life settlements portfolio in 2017 and lower gain on fair value option portfolios in 2018.
108 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. the primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.
investment highlights in 2019

a drop in interest rates and narrowing credit spreads resulted in a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio. net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $17.9 billion as of december 31, 2019 from approximately $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2018.we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.we experienced higher investment returns in our alternative investments portfolio due to robust equity market returns in 2019, income from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio, and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected. this compares to the prior year where returns were lower as a result of an increase in interest rates and widening credit spreads that occurred, lower hedge fund performance, as well as negative performance of our fair value option equity securities portfolio.during the first quarter of 2019, we sold our remaining investment in people's insurance company (group) of china limited and picc property &amp; casualty company limited (collectively, our picc investment).blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.
investment strategies investment strategies are assessed at the business segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax and legal investment limitations.
some of our key investment strategies are as follows:
our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable. aig embeds environmental, social and governance (esg) considerations in its fundamental investment analysis of the companies or projects we invest in to ensure that they have sustainable earnings over the full term of our investment. aig considers internal and external factors and evaluates changes in consumer behavior, industry trends related to esg factors as well as the ability of the management of companies to respond appropriately to these changes in order to maintain their competitive advantage.
we seek to originate investments that offer enhanced yield through liquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.
given our global presence, we have access to assets that provide diversification from local markets. to the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge the currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to risk assets in the functional currency.
aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, aig parent purchases publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
within the u.s., the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.

table of contents item 7 | investments
‒insurance reserves are backed by mainly investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. we assess fixed maturity asset classes based on their fundamental risk, including credit (public and private), commercial mortgages and residential mortgages regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.
‒surplus accounts seek to enhance portfolio returns through a mix of fixed maturity (investment grade and high yield) and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity, real estate and leveraged capital (for example, we are currently focused on purchasing directly originated, middle market loans with strong covenant packages).
outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
asset liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. assets with varying degrees of liquidity and volatility are allocated based on whether backing reserves, required surplus or excess surplus, subject to capital, liquidity, and regulatory constraints. general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies' domestic operations have an average duration of 3.5 years. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies' foreign operations have an average duration of 3.6 years.
while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and liquidity premiums, particularly in the domestic operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.
in addition, a portion of the surplus of general insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments which seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth. there is a higher allocation to equity-oriented investments in general insurance relative to other aig portfolios given the underlying inflation risks inherent in that business. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value for surplus accounts, subject to asset liability management, capital, and regulatory constraints.
the life and retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses, and an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio. a further lengthening of the portfolio will be assessed in the context of available market opportunities as longer duration markets may not provide similar diversification benefits as shorter duration markets.
fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies' domestic operations have an average duration of 8.0 years. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset class, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.
in addition, the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields.
naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'naic designations.' in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade,
110 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency rmbs and cmbs, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of aig subsidiaries fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.

(a)upon the adoption of the financial instruments recognition and measurement standard on january 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer required to be evaluated for other-than-temporary impairments.
(b) impairments include $360 million related to investments in our life settlements portfolio that were sold in 2017.
our investments in life settlements are monitored for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis quarterly. an investment in life settlements is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount. this amount is defined as the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlements plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs, if any. impaired investments in life settlements are written down to their estimated fair value. this is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current market mortality assumptions and market yields or by repricing to the anticipated sale price as appropriate.
impairments on life settlements in 2017 were mainly attributable to write-downs of the policies to the purchase price as agreed in the sale of the life settlements portfolio. we sold the remaining portion of our life settlements portfolio in 2017.
118 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments other-than-temporary impairments to determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.

*includes other-than-temporary impairment charges on private equity funds, hedge funds and direct private equity investments. upon the adoption of the financial instruments recognition and measurement standard on january 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer required to be evaluated for other-than-temporary impairments.
we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 related to:
issuer-specific credit events;
securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell;
declines due to foreign exchange rates;
adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and
securities that experienced severe market valuation declines.
in addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements.
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. the accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $440 million in 2019, $530 million in 2018 and $669 million in 2017.
for a discussion of our other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

change in unrealized gains and losses on investments the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. for 2019, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity securities increased by $14.2 billion due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads.
the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2018 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. for 2018, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities decreased by $9.9 billion due primarily to an increase in rates and a widening of credit spreads.

(a)upon the adoption of the financial instruments recognition and measurement standard on january 1, 2018, the change in fair value of all equity securities is included in net investment income.
(b)in 2019, includes $200 million from the sale and concurrent leaseback of our corporate headquarters and $300 million as a result of sales in investment real estate properties. in 2018, primarily includes $96 million and $49 million of realized gains on the sale of shares of onemain holdings, inc. and an investment in castle holdings llc's aircraft assets, respectively.
net realized capital gains in 2019 compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year due to gains on the sales of securities and foreign exchange compared to losses on sales of securities and foreign exchange in 2018, as well as lower impairments in 2019 and losses on private equity sales in 2018. partially offsetting these gains were derivative losses in 2019 compared to gains in the prior year.
net realized capital losses in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 due primarily to derivative gains in 2018 compared to derivative losses in 2017. net realized capital losses in 2018 were primarily related to a loss on the sale of a portion of our private equity portfolio, foreign exchange losses, and other-than-temporary impairment charges, which more than offset derivative gains.
net realized capital losses in 2017 consisted primarily of losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, and impairments, which were partially offset by gains on the sales of securities and foreign exchange gains.
variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected losses in 2019 compared to gains in the prior year primarily due to changes in the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with gmwb embedded derivative, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program.

table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves net loss development - 2018
during 2018, we recognized adverse prior year net loss reserve development of $362 million. this unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following:
unfavorable development in u.s. excess casualty, driven by the combination of construction defect and construction wrap claims from accident year 2015 and prior where we reacted to significant increases in severity and longer claim reporting patterns, as well as higher than expected loss severity in accident years 2016 and 2017, which led to an increase in estimates for these accident years;
unfavorable development in u.s. financial lines, primarily from d&o and employment practices liability (epli) policies covering corporate and national insureds as well as private and not-for-profit insureds. this development was predominantly in accident years 2014-2017 and resulted largely from increases in severity as the frequency of class action lawsuits increased in those years.
favorable development in u.s. commercial property and specialty lines due to reductions in our estimates for 2017 catastrophes and favorable development from the attritional losses in commercial property and specialty.
unfavorable development in u.s. personal lines reflecting an increase in estimates in respect of the california wildfires and hurricane irma in 2017.
adverse development in financial lines in europe and other areas across the world that have seen increases in the frequency and severity of large losses.
net loss development - 2017
during 2017, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $978 million. this unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following:
unfavorable development in u.s. excess casualty and u.s. other casualty, driven primarily by increases in underlying severity and greater than expected emerging loss experience in accident year 2016 as well as increased development from claims related to construction defects and construction wrap business (largely from accident years 2006 and prior).
unfavorable development in u.s. financial lines, primarily from d&o policies covering privately owned and not-for-profit insureds. this development was predominantly in accident year 2016 and resulted largely from increases in bankruptcy-related claims and fiduciary liability claims for large educational institutions.
higher than expected losses for europe casualty and financial lines, including a significant increase in large claims activity in our europe long-tail business, with a large proportion emanating from accident year 2016. in addition, we increased our loss reserves as a result of the decision made by the uk ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump-sum bodily injury payouts, known as the ogden rate.
in addition, we also observed higher than expected losses in our europe property and special risks business driven by unexpected development on various large claims across the property, aviation, marine, and trade credit segments.
we note that for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. these reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above.
significant reinsurance agreements in the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. this transaction resulted in a gain, which under u.s. gaap retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. nico created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and berkshire has provided a parental guarantee to secure nico's obligations under the agreement.

the majority of the lines of business which experienced adverse prior year development have been subject to the adverse development reinsurance agreement. this agreement has resulted in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. in addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets.

life and annuity reserves and dac the following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs.
update of actuarial assumptions the life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, generally in the third quarter. assumption setting standards vary between investment-oriented products and traditional long-duration products.

table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves investment-oriented products the life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize dac and related items (which may include voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) for investment-oriented products at least annually. estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. in estimating future gross profits, lapse and other assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves are recalculated using the updated assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
the life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective gmwb living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. the fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.
various assumptions were updated, including the following effective september 30, 2019:
•we increased our reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) to 3.62 percent from 2.92 percent for the variable annuity product line in individual retirement and to 3.29 percent from 1.90 percent for the variable annuity product line in group retirement primarily due to the recent strong returns in equity markets. our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7.0 percent; and
•our ultimate projected yields on invested assets changed on most annuity deposits with some increased by up to 9 basis points and others decreased by up to 34 basis points and lowered by up to 40 basis points on some life insurance deposits. projected yields are graded from a weighted average net gaap book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. the grading period is three years for deferred annuity products and five years for life insurance products due to deferred annuities having a shorter duration than life products.
traditional long-duration products for long-duration traditional products discussed below, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a "lock-in" principle applies. the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate.
the net increases (decreases) to adjusted pre-tax income and pre-tax income as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the following tables.

in 2019, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable adjustment of $173 million, primarily in index annuities driven by an update to lapse assumptions, and in life insurance primarily due to methodology enhancements related to projected premium, certain riders and death benefit features, and reinsurance reserving. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by favorable updates to full surrender assumptions in individual retirement fixed annuities.
in 2018, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable adjustment of $208 million, primarily in variable annuities driven by reductions to the gmwb full surrender assumption, in life insurance primarily due to strengthening of reserves for certain riders and interest crediting model refinements, and in legacy accident & health insurance loss recognition. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by favorable adjustments in life insurance primarily due to lower lapse and mortality assumptions and a reduction in ibnr reserves and in individual retirement due to lower lapse assumptions in fixed annuities and refinements to partial withdrawal assumptions in variable annuities.
in 2017, adjusted pre-tax income included a net favorable adjustment of $270 million, primarily driven by lower lapse assumptions in fixed annuities, improved mortality assumptions in life insurance, and an increase in the reversion to the mean rates in variable annuities. the favorable adjustments were partially offset by lower spread assumptions in fixed annuities and a loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the legacy life and retirement run-off lines.
the adjustments related to the update of actuarial assumptions in each period are discussed by segment below.
update of actuarial assumptions by segment individual retirement the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net favorable (unfavorable) adjustments to adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement of $(63) million, $(52) million and $242 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in fixed annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net favorable adjustment of $82 million, $40 million and $130 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which reflected lower lapse assumptions including the economic impact to competitor rate on the interest sensitive lapse component, partially offset by lower interest spread assumptions.
in variable and index annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of $145 million in 2019, primarily due to lapse updates in index annuities and updated general account earned rates on variable annuities. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by updated lapse assumptions in variable annuities. in 2018, a net unfavorable adjustment of $92 million primarily due to refinements to the guaranteed benefit partial withdrawal assumptions in variable annuities and the multi-year index strategy crediting parameters in index annuities. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by lower guaranteed benefit lapse assumptions in variable annuities. in 2017, a net favorable adjustment of $112 million was primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in volatility assumptions. the net favorable adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and an unfavorable adjustment in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for index annuities.

table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves group retirement in group retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in an unfavorable adjustment of $17 million in 2019, primarily due to lapse updates in index annuities and variable annuities. in 2018, a favorable adjustment of $17 million was primarily due to improved premium persistency assumptions. in 2017, a net favorable adjustment of $13 million was primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in maintenance expense assumptions. the net favorable adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and decreases in fixed annuity spread and separate account fee assumptions.
life insurance in life insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of $63 million in 2019, primarily due to methodology enhancements related to projected premium, certain riders and death benefit features, and reinsurance reserving. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by favorable adjustments driven by updates to mortality assumptions. in 2018, a net unfavorable adjustment of $63 million primarily due to additional reserves for certain riders, decreased lapses and interest crediting model refinements. the unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by favorable adjustments driven by updates to mortality assumptions and a reduction to ibnr reserves. in 2017, a net favorable adjustment of $29 million was primarily due to improved mortality assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions.
legacy portfolio in the legacy portfolio, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of $30 million in 2019, reflecting updates to loss recognition reserves and methodology enhancements for universal life insurance. in 2018, a net unfavorable adjustment of $110 million in 2018, primarily due to $105 million of loss recognition expense on accident and health business (other than long-term care) in the legacy life and retirement run-off lines resulting from assumption and model refinements. in 2017, a net unfavorable adjustment of $14 million was primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the legacy life and retirement run-off lines resulting from model enhancements.
variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.
for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies' key risks - variable annuity, index annuity and universal life risk management and hedging programs.
differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the u.s. gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:
•the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the u.s. gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;
•the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u.s. gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•the economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the u.s. gaap valuation, which reflects a market participant's view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the npa spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows.
128 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins, the u.s. gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.
for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and
•risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.
the following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the u.s. gaap embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:

impact on pre-tax income (loss)
the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the u.s. gaap embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.

* beginning in july 2019, the fixed maturity securities portfolio used in the hedging program was rebalanced to reposition the portfolio from a duration, sector, and issuer perspective. as part of this rebalancing fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option were sold. later in the quarter, as new fixed maturity securities were purchased they were classified as available for sale. the change in fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities recognized as a component of other comprehensive income was $57 million for 2019.
the net impact on pre-tax income from the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges in 2019 (excluding related dac amortization) was driven by tightening of credits spreads on the npa spread, and impact of lower interest rates on the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa, net of the hedging portfolio, offset by impact of lower interest rates that resulted in npa volume gains from higher expected gmwb payments, and gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions. in 2018, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the npa spread, and higher interest rates, partially offset by losses from the impact of the change in credit spreads and the move from an economic to a u.s. gaap discount basis. in 2017, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the npa spread and the impact on the npa volume of lower expected gmwb payments, driven by higher equity markets.
the change in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, excluding npa and update of actuarial assumptions, in 2019 reflected losses from decreases in interest rates and tightening crediting spreads, offset by gains from higher equity markets. the change in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, excluding npa and update of actuarial assumptions, in 2018 reflected losses from lower equity markets and the impact of moving from an economic to a gaap discount basis, offset by increases in interest rates and widening credit spreads. in 2018, the hedge losses were driven by losses from higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, offset by gains from lower equity markets. in 2017, the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and npa, was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio.
fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u.s. gaap basis, due to the npa and other risk margins used for u.s. gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. on an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below.
change in economic hedge target the increase in the economic hedge target liability in 2019 was primarily due to lower interest rates, offset by higher equity markets and gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions. the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2018 was primarily due to higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads, offset by lower equity markets.
130 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under u.s. gaap, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. beginning in july 2019, the change in the fair value of available-for-sale hedging bonds is reported as a component of comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). prior to july 2019, the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which was excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the individual retirement and group retirement segments, was reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income (loss). the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2019 reflected gains due to decreases in interest rates, and tightening credit spreads. the net losses in 2018 reflected the impact of increases in interest rates, and widening of credit spreads. the net gains in 2017 were primarily due to tightening of credit spreads.
changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in gains driven by lower interest rates in 2019 compared to losses in the prior year, which was driven by higher interest rates. the small net loss in 2017 reflected increases in rates in the latter half of 2017, partially offset by the impact of interest rate declines in the first half of 2017.
the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, reflected losses in 2019, gains in 2018 and losses in 2017, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods.

*dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $10.0 billion, $9.3 billion and $8.9 billion at december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the net adjustments to dac amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in dac related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented two percent, four percent and two percent of the dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
reversion to the mean the reversion to the mean rate is updated quarterly based on market returns and can change dramatically in periods where market returns move significantly. the five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2019 which would have otherwise required a reset of the start date used in the calculation of the average gross long-term return rate. the long-term growth assumption used in our reversion to the mean methodology remained unchanged at 7.0 percent in 2019 and 2018.
in 2017, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). the five-year reversion to the mean period met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. as a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to december 31, 2011 for individual retirement and june 30, 2013 for group retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in individual retirement and 3.78 percent in group retirement. sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the individual retirement or group retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.

table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology see critical accounting estimates - estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products.
dac and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments dac and reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in dac, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to other comprehensive income (oci) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow investment-oriented adjustments). similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow loss adjustments) with an offset to oci to be recorded.
shadow adjustments to dac and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported dac and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.
market interest rates decreased in 2019, which drove a $12.6 billion increase in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the life and retirement companies at december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2019, the shadow investment-oriented adjustments reflected decreases in dac and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities compared to december 31, 2018, while the shadow loss adjustments reflected an increase in future policy benefit liabilities.

table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. it is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. we endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our treasury group with oversight by enterprise risk management (erm). our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both aig parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.
see enterprise risk management - risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement and enterprise risk management - liquidity risk management below for additional information.
capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. we must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. these constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at aig and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using erm's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both aig and our insurance subsidiaries.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.
nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. in addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders and aig common stock and/or warrant repurchases.

operating cash flow activities insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. the ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.
interest payments totaled $1.3 billion in 2019 compared to $1.3 billion in 2018 and $1.2 billion in 2017. excluding interest payments, aig had operating cash inflows of $399 million in 2019 compared to operating cash inflows of $1.4 billion in 2018 and operating cash outflows of $6.6 billion in 2017. the operating cash outflows in 2017 were primarily due to payment for the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with nico.

liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2019, aig parent had approximately $12.1 billion in liquidity sources. aig parent's liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities and also include a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility. fixed maturity securities primarily include u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. aig parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. we expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or aig common stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
in the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of aig's deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.

table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources in developing plans to distribute capital, aig considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: aig's business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, aig's funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.
the following table presents aig parent's liquidity sources:

(a)cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $2.1 billion and $22 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(b)unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. fixed maturity securities primarily include u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
(c)for additional information relating to this committed, syndicated credit facility see credit facilities below.
insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.
our general insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect a subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations. increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.
management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our life and retirement companies' investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. furthermore, our life and retirement companies' products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. however, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. as part of their risk management framework, our life and retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.
certain of our u.s. insurance companies are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts. borrowings from fhlbs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. our u.s. general insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings from fhlbs at december 31, 2019 and aggregate outstanding borrowings of approximately $115 million at december 31, 2018. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion which were due to fhlbs in their respective districts at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets operating segments, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits. in addition, our u.s. life and retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from fhlbs at both december 31, 2019 and 2018.
138 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources certain of our u.s. life and retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these u.s. life and retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments or partially used for short-term liquidity purposes. additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a life and retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $2.8 billion and $884 million of securities subject to these agreements at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.9 billion and $904 million of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
aig generally manages capital between aig parent and our insurance companies through internal, board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. in addition, aig parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (cmas) in place with certain subsidiaries. nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
in february 2018, aig parent entered into a cma with fortitude re. among other things, the cma provides that aig parent will maintain available statutory capital and surplus in each of fortitude re's long term business fund and general business account at or above a stress threshold percentage of its projected enhanced capital requirement in respect of the applicable fund, as defined under bermuda law. as of december 31, 2019, the stress threshold percentage under this cma was 125 percent.
aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. these letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown by our insurance companies. letters of credit issued in support of the general insurance companies totaled approximately $3.9 billion at december 31, 2019. letters of credit issued in support of the life and retirement companies totaled approximately $859 million at december 31, 2019. letters of credit issued in support of fortitude re totaled $550 million at december 31, 2019.
in 2019, our general insurance companies collectively paid a total of approximately $2.2 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to aig parent. the fixed maturity securities primarily included u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
in 2019, our life and retirement companies collectively paid a total of approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash to aig parent.
tax matters if the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the u.s. treasury. although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.7 billion, including obligations of aig parent and subsidiaries. this amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. there remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payment(s) or prepayment(s), one or more of which could be made as early as the first quarter of 2020.
for additional information regarding this matter see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
credit facilities we maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. the facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in june 2022.
as of december 31, 2019, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the facility. our ability to utilize the facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. however, our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we expect to utilize the facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

(b)the company also procured additional office space via operating lease contracts for which lease commencement will occur in 2020. future undiscounted obligations stemming from those contracts total $507 million, which excludes the effect of renewal options.

loss reserves loss reserves relate to our general insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. we believe that our general insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.
insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities, including gic liabilities, relate to our life and retirement companies. these liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. for these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. these assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets.
140 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources we believe that our life and retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. in addition, our life and retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.
borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. we expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt or preferred stock issuance and other financing arrangements. borrowings supported by assets of aig include various notes and bonds payable as well as gias that are supported by cash and investments held by aig parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

(a)excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. for further information on indemnification obligations see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources
(b)includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the united states and abroad. the commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. the expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.
(c)does not include guarantees, cmas or other support arrangements among aig consolidated entities.
(d)primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.
(e)excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. the annual pension contribution for 2020 is expected to be approximately $65 million for u.s. and non-u.s. plans.
arrangements with variable interest entities we enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (vies) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a vie when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.
for a further discussion of our involvement with vies see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
indemnification agreements we are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. these arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. these arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.
for additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
we have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. these liabilities are not material in the aggregate. we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

these credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.
we are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers." depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.
in the event of a downgrade of aig's long-term senior debt ratings, aigfp and certain other aig entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of aigfp or of such other aig entities would be permitted to terminate such transactions early.
the actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.
overview we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management (erm) department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by erm. erm supports our businesses and management by embedding risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by our businesses and aig overall. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.
aig employs a three lines of defense model. aig's business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, and erm performs a review, challenge and oversight function. the third line consists of our internal audit group that provides independent assurance for aig's board.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. accountability for the implementation of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. we review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern both our risks and risk-taking activities.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk and capital committee (rcc) and audit committee. these committees regularly interact with other committees of the board of directors which are further described below. our chief risk officer (cro) reports to both the rcc and our chief executive officer.
the group risk committee (grc): the grc is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength and reputation. the grc is chaired by our cro and includes members of the executive leadership team (elt). our cro reports periodically on behalf of the grc to both the rcc and the audit committee of the board of directors. our cro is also a member of the elt providing erm the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.
management committees that support the grc are described below. these committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout aig and its subsidiaries. these committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates. in addition, various working groups (e.g. reputational risk, control agenda) are in place in support of the grc to manage and monitor the various risks across the organization.
financial risk group (frg): the frg is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by aig and our subsidiaries. its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. it provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. the frg is chaired by our cro. membership of the frg also includes our cfo, chief investment officer and treasurer.
146 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management business unit risk committees: each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. the risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. in performing these responsibilities, the business unit risk committees may leverage input provided by other business unit committees and working groups.
risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement risk appetite framework our risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. the framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the board of directors and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.
we articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. these measures are set at the aig parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. we must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our capital management and liquidity policies. our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. the grc routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. a consolidated risk report is also presented periodically to the rcc by our cro.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates the monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. our objectives include:
establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;
defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and
aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.
to support the monitoring and management of aig's and its business units' material risks, erm has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:
board-level risk tolerances are aig's aggregate consolidated capital and parent liquidity limits. they define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. these board-level risk tolerances require rcc and board approval.
aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level. these limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital aig has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. these limits are approved by our cro with consultation from the grc.
business unit and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. these limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.
all limits are reviewed by the grc or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.
the business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. erm is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.
risk identification and measurement we conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. in addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. these processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
we employ various approaches to measure and monitor risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. we use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.
the internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. we leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.
the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risks in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to aig consolidated capital. the framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress, and includes multi-factor stresses as well as single factor sensitivities that are designed to reflect aig's risk characteristics. we use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.
we evaluate and manage risk in material topics as shown below. these topics are discussed in further detail in the following pages:

credit risk management                       liquidity risk management                    insurance risks
market risk management                       operational risk management                  other business risks
148 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management credit risk management overview credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.
we devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. these exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain general insurance businesses.
governance our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to erm oversight and various control processes. their primary role is to ensure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. our chief credit officer (cco) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:
developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;
approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;
developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;
managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;
evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and
approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. we treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. we also closely monitor the quality of any trust collateral accounts.
for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see investments - available-for-sale investments.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:
risk identification                                                                                                              including the ongoing capture and monitoring of all existing, contingent, potential and emerging credit risk exposures, whether funded or unfunded

we are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. within each business, the risk officer is responsible for creating a framework for proper identification of market risks, and ensuring that the risks are appropriately measured, monitored and managed, and are in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer (cmro).
the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in the above mentioned market risk drivers.
many of our market risk exposures, including exposures to changes in levels of interest rates and equity prices, are associated with the asset and liability exposures of our life and retirement companies. these exposures are generally long-term in nature. examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. these interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.
governance market risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the cmro. the cmro is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within erm. market risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with erm. the cmro is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:
written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;
a limit framework that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement;
independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and
clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.
these components facilitate the cmro's identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.
150 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable variables. financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital of aig.
each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:
equity prices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, alternative risk premia investment strategies, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.

residential and commercial real estate values   our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.
interest rates                                  interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. however, when rates rise quickly, there can be an asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported through other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of certain liabilities may not be recognized. changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. additionally, for variable annuity, index annuity, and equity indexed universal life products, deviations in actual versus expected policyholder behavior can be driven by fluctuations in various market variables, including interest rates. policies with guaranteed living benefit options or riders are also subject to the risk of actual benefit utilization being different than expected.
credit spreads                                  credit spreads measure an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, aig-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives, derivative credit valuation adjustments and economic valuation of insurance liabilities. much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads paired with unchanged expectations about default losses imply higher investment income in the long term. in the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported through other comprehensive income. a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.
foreign exchange (fx) rates                     we are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.
commodity prices                                changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices, derivatives on commodities and commodity indices, and other commodity-linked investments and insurance contracts. we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers' debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.
inflation                                       changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including aig-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. at the firm-wide level, market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aig's risk appetite statement. this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. the framework measures our overall exposure to change in each of the systemic market risk factors on an economic basis.
in addition, we monitor risks through multiple lenses that include economic, gaap and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation. this process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments.
we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:
examples include:

sensitivity analysis   measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input                                                   •a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, •a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and •a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.
scenario analysis      uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures        •a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or •a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets. scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.
stress testing         a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome   •the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008.
152 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates on our financial instruments and excludes approximately $169.4 billion and $168.9 billion as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, respectively, of insurance liabilities. aig believes that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance and other liabilities serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets presented in the table below.

(a)the economic effect is the difference between the estimated fair value and the effect of a 100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves on the estimated fair value. the estimated fair values for mortgage and other loans receivable, policyholder contract deposits (investment-type contracts) and long-term debt were $43,783 million, $133,246 million and $26,427 million at december 31, 2019, respectively. the estimated fair values for mortgage and other loans receivable, policyholder contract deposits (investment-type contracts) and long-term debt were $40,152 million, $121,374 million and $23,929 million at december 31, 2018, respectively.
(b)at december 31, 2019, the analysis covered $300.2 billion of $306.3 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $3.5 billion of loans. in addition, $2.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. at december 31, 2018, the analysis covered $278.4 billion of $285.8 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $3.5 billion of loans. in addition, $3.9 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.
(c)at december 31, 2019, the analysis excluded $643 million of aiglh borrowings, $353 million of validus borrowings, $47 million of borrowings from glatfelter and $344 million of aig japan holdings loans. at december 31, 2018, the analysis excluded $643 million of aiglh borrowings, $359 million of validus borrowings, $168 million of borrowings from fhlb and $331 million of aig japan holdings loans.
(d)the balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under "interest rate sensitive liabilities" above, and are not additive.
(e)the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. we cannot ensure that actual financial impacts in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.
interest rate sensitivity is defined as change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.
we evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. this scenario does not measure changes in values resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curves, which could produce different results.
we evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. the stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.
foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our aggregated non-u.s. dollar assets less our aggregated non-u.s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis, with certain adjustments. we use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory surplus at the regulated insurance entity level. at the aig consolidated level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.
our three largest foreign currency-denominated net asset positions at december 31, 2019 are great britain pound ($1.8 billion), south korean won ($331 million), and australian dollar ($276 million).
our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at december 31, 2019, decreased by $1.4 billion compared to december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in our euro position. the reduction in our euro position is principally due to currency conversions associated with internal reinsurance agreements and the rebalancing of net assets across european operations due to brexit. our hong kong dollar position also decreased $550 million, primarily due to the sale of our picc investment. offsetting these decreases was a $299 million increase in our canadian dollar position, primarily due to hedging actions designed to protect statutory surplus at the regulated insurance entity level.
for illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point parallel increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equity prices and prices of alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar. the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.
the sensitivity factors utilized for 2019 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1999 to 2019, as follows (see the table below):
a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;
a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the s&p 500; and
a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the u.s. dollar (usd)/japanese yen (jpy) exchange rate.

risk monitoring and limits the risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities must be reported to the erm market risk team by the relevant business unit. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
to control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the cmro closely monitors and reports to our cro, senior management and risk committees.
for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits.
liquidity risk management overview liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying stress conditions. if we project that we could breach these tolerances, we assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. however, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.
governance liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm. the cro has responsibility for the oversight of the liquidity risk management framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the aig treasurer. our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to erm oversight and various control processes.
the liquidity risk management framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the board-approved risk appetite statement. the principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.
our liquidity risk management framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig-specific, broader industry and market-related liquidity events.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.
market/monetization risk                                        assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.

cash flow mismatch risk    discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.
event funding risk         additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.
financing risk             we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, aig-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.
risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. in addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.
we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:
minimum liquidity limits                                                                               minimum liquidity limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in order to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.

coverage ratios            coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed stressed conditions and within the specified time horizon.
cash flow forecasts        cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.
stress testing             asset liquidity and coverage ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.
relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees. the frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.
operational risk management overview operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
156 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management governance aig and its consolidated subsidiaries establish and maintain operational risk and controls governance forums that include representatives from the relevant business units and functions to appropriately manage significant operational risk exposures.
operational risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the head of governance and operational controls. the head of governance and operational controls is responsible for the development and maintenance of the operational risk framework that includes policies, standards and deployment of systems.
risk identification, measurement and monitoring the operational risk management (orm) function within erm oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, measurement, management and monitoring of operational risk exposures. orm supports the head of governance and operational controls and has responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. in line with the three lines of defense model, the orm program includes, but is not limited to, several key components outlined below:
risk event capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes, promoting lessons learned and embedding a culture of risk management.
risk assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.
key risk indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.
issues management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.
scenario analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.
orm, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., compliance, financial controls unit / sarbanes oxley, global business continuity, and internal audit) through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business unit and corporate function cro and owner of the control agenda, whose responsibilities include coordinating identification, assessment, control and mitigation of risks to the operating environment and promoting awareness, to facilitate implementation of the above programs. this includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, corporate functions, investing, model risk, technology, third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.
the risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues and is designed to:

ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;enhance transparency, risk management governance and culture;foster greater consistency in identifying, measuring and ranking material risks;proactively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for risk treatment; andmanage the development of technology solutions that support the objectives above.
cybersecurity risk cybersecurity risk is an important, constant, and evolving focus for aig and the insurance and financial services industries in general. the goal of unauthorized parties, using a variety of attack methods, is to gain access to aig's data and systems to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. one such example, is the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties using phishing in an attempt to access our systems, usually in an effort to obtain sensitive information, which is an ever-present and increasing attack vector against aig. cybersecurity risks may also derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of aig employees or third parties who have authorized access to aig's systems or information.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management erm works closely with and supports the risk management practices of information technology and the information security office and the business units and functions that form the first line of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face, including the risks that emerge as a result of the execution of our business strategies and our corresponding exposure to new products, clients, industry segments and regions, through initiatives such as investments in technological infrastructure, education and training for employees and vendors, and monitoring of industry developments. as part of our overarching cybersecurity strategy, erm monitors and assesses the programs designed to remediate our exposures and enhance our systems and applications security.
aig's board of directors and its technology committee are regularly briefed by management on aig's cybersecurity matters, including threats, policies, practices and ongoing efforts to improve security. as part of our disclosure controls and procedures, the cyber incident management team, a cross functional group, is responsible for ensuring that the members of management responsible for disclosure controls are informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents that may materially impact our operations so that timely notifications and public disclosures can be made as appropriate. there is no guarantee that the measures aig takes and the resources aig devotes to protect against cybersecurity risk will provide absolute security or recoverability of aig's systems given the complexity and frequency of the risk which aig may not always be able to anticipate or adequately address. for additional information regarding the data protection and cybersecurity regulations to which we are subject, see item 1. business - regulation - u.s. regulation - privacy, data protection and cybersecurity and - international regulation - privacy, data protection and cybersecurity. for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
insurance risks overview insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. uncertainties related to insurance risk include the amount and timing of cash flows from premiums, commissions, expenses, claims and claim settlement expenses paid or received under a contract.
except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures:
pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;
underwriting approval processes and authorities;
exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;
pricing and risk selection models;
price approval processes;

we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
158 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management governance insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level and overseen by the business unit risk officer. as part of our established governance practices, key decisions and considerations related to insurance risks can be raised and deferred for discussion and consideration to business unit risk committees that are chaired by the business unit's chief risk officer. in addition, in some business units, pricing committees review insurance risk considerations associated with pricing of new insurance products. the insurance risk oversight framework includes the following key components:
written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;
a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement; and
clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.
risk identification
general insurance companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. we manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.
life and retirement companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the individual life, individual health-care and group life insurance products, longevity risk in the individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets products, and policyholder behavior across all product lines. we manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting.
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:

sensitivity analysis. deterministic analyses are used to measure statistical variances from best estimate assumptions on important risk factors, as well as different distributions risk categories.stochastic methods. stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. we develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.scenario analysis. scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism and pandemic or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.experience studies. ongoing assessment of mortality, longevity, morbidity and policyholder behavior experience relative to that assumed in pricing and valuation and that experienced in the general market.
additionally, there are risk specific assessment tools in place to better manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.
we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.
the risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
risk limits have a consistent framework used across aig, its business units, and legal entities. this includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.
for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management general insurance companies' key risks we manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes or societal trends.
for general insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:
loss reserves - the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies. there is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. we manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. for further information see critical accounting estimates - insurance liabilities - loss reserves.
underwriting - the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the general insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. this may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.
catastrophe exposure - our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.
single risk loss exposure - our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the chief underwriting officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.
reinsurance - since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. the inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. we apply proprietary multi-model approaches, making adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
we perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. the majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.
we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. for example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. in addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.
our natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the u.s. and secondarily japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. for example, we have exposures to additional perils such as european windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. within the u.s., we have significant hurricane exposure in florida, the
160 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management gulf of mexico, the northeast u.s. and mid-atlantic regions. within the u.s., we have significant earthquake exposure in california and the pacific northwest regions. earthquakes impacting the pacific northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.
the table below details our modeled estimates of pml, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. estimates as of december 31, 2019 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of october 1, 2019 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of december 31, 2019, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of january 1, 2020.
the following table presents an overview of annual aggregate modeled losses for world-wide all perils and exposures arising from our largest primarily modeled perils:

aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. however, reinsurance recoverables may not be fully collectible. therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.
our 2020 property catastrophe reinsurance program is a worldwide program providing both aggregate and per occurrence protection, with differing per occurrence and aggregate attachment points for north america, japan, and rest of world (with some additional regional/country variations). the program includes $2.5 billion of aggregate limit that is shared across the regional towers.
our coverage for north america includes:
$1.525 billion of per occurrence protection covering our u.s and caribbean high net worth personal lines business, with varying attachment points in specific geographies ranging from $50 million to $150 million
per occurrence protection of up to $1 billion excess of $500 million, primarily covering commercial exposures but also personal lines exposures not covered by the above high net worth personal lines protection
aggregate protection utilizing the $2.5 billion of shared limit attaching excess $750 million with per occurrence deductibles of $25 million, $50 million or $75 million, depending on region/event, primarily covering commercial exposures but also covering our u.s. and caribbean high net worth personal lines exposure to earthquakes our coverage for exposure outside north america includes:
japan per occurrence coverage of $550 million excess of $200 million and includes both personal and commercial exposure
rest of world per occurrence coverage of $300 million excess of $100 million, including both personal and commercial exposure
rest of world and japan $2.5 billion of aggregate shared limit attaching excess of $160 million and $250 million, respectively, with per occurrence deductibles of $20 million although the shared limit coverage for north america, japan and rest of world has varying retentions per region, the maximum aggregate retention globally is $1.0 billion for 2020.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management we have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside north america.
for validus reinsurance ltd., our catastrophe protection comes from a variety of reinsurance protections but is largely providing $400 million of limit excess $300 million of retention from world-wide exposure via an aggregate excess of loss cover with an additional $450 million of limit excess $700 million via the tailwind re cat bond for u.s., puerto rico and canada named storm losses.
actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
for additional information see also item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. we have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the general insurance companies' exposures. examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.
our largest terrorism concentrations are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. at our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.4 billion based on the exposures as of october 1, 2019.
our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by tripra in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. tripra covers terrorist attacks within the united states or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. in 2020, tripra covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. the current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.0 billion for 2019.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
life and retirement companies' key risks we manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.
for life and retirement companies, risks include the following:
longevity risk - represents the risk of an increase in value of an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. this risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. this risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.
morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. this risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions. this risk exists in a number of our product lines such as accident and health and long -term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to fortitude re and u.s. group benefits which aig has almost fully exited.
mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. this risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. this risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.
162 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management
policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender/lapse risk) - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. there are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits, options and guarantees. actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. this risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. this risk exists in many of our product lines, but most notably within the annuity portfolio of business.
the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or revised expectations would require an adjustment to dac and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.
for additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and critical accounting estimates - guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products. for additional discussion of business risks see item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
variable annuity, index annuity and universal life risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (glb) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. glbs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). glb features subject the life and retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include glb rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds, which have an ability to reduce equity exposures in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.
after reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within glb features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these glb embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. the hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.
our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our glb riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the glb, less the present value of future glb rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. this stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. the risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged, and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.
due to differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the value of the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in levels of equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.
for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results.
in designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract mutual funds. to project future account value changes, we use these assumptions about how each of the underlying mutual funds will perform. we map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. basis risk exists due to the variance between fund returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge target. net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. these hedging programs are designed to offset economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. these programs utilize derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.
our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. in addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities. the majority of these securities are classified as available for sale, with a relatively small portion for which we elect the fair value option. to minimize counterparty credit risk the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are highly collateralized.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
reinsurance activities reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (life and non-life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
reinsurance markets include:
traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the united states, bermuda, london and europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and
other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.
the form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:
proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;
non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or
facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.
we continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
in certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.
164 aig | 2019 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management reinsurance recoverable aig's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:
paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.
ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for ibnr.
ceded reserves for unearned premiums.
life and annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).
at december 31, 2019, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $31.4 billion including reserves for ibnr claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.2 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.5 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2019 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.
the reinsurance credit department (rcd) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. the rcd monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. as part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. the rcd reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. for example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (rbc) ratios fall below certain levels. we also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. in addition, credit executives within erm review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. at december 31, 2019, we held $23.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.

at december 31, 2019, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the rcd, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.
for further discussion of reinsurance recoverable see critical accounting estimates - reinsurance assets.

table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management other business risks derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. the maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm.
we evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the aig credit policy. we utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk related to outstanding financial derivative transactions. we require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as isda master agreements. these provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. as a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.
the fair value of our interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported as a component of other assets, was approximately $0.8 billion at december 31, 2019 and $0.9 billion at december 31, 2018. where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective master netting agreements.
the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives portfolios in asset positions by internal counterparty credit rating:

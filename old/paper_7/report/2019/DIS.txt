•   business segment results - 2018 vs. 2017
•   corporate and unallocated shared expenses

•   contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements
•   critical accounting policies and estimates
•   forward-looking statements consolidated results and non-segment items the company's financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with new accounting guidance for revenue recognition (asc 606) that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting guidance. segment operating income for fiscal 2019 includes a $91 million benefit from the adoption of asc 606 primarily due to the timing of recognition of tv/svod distribution revenue at studio entertainment. further information about our adoption of asc 606 is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
2019 vs. 2018
as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the company acquired tfcf on march 20, 2019. additionally, in connection with the acquisition of tfcf, we acquired a controlling interest in hulu. the company began consolidating the results of tfcf and hulu effective march 20, 2019.
revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 17%, or $10.1 billion, to $69.6 billion; net income attributable to disney decreased 12%, or $1.5 billion, to $11.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to disney (eps) decreased 25%, or $2.09 to $6.27. the decrease in eps was due to the comparison to a benefit in fiscal 2018 from u.s. federal income tax legislation (tax act), which was enacted in fiscal 2018 (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), amortization expense on intangibles and the fair value step-up on film and television costs from the tfcf acquisition and consolidation of hulu, an increase in shares outstanding and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of tfcf. the increase in shares outstanding was due to shares that were issued in connection with the acquisition of tfcf. additionally, the decrease in eps reflected lower segment operating income, which included a $0.5 billion adverse impact from the consolidation of tfcf and hulu in the current year, the absence of a gain recognized in the prior year on the sale of real estate, a charge in the current year for the extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense. these decreases were partially offset by a non-cash gain recognized in the current year in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in hulu (hulu gain) (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). segment operating income from our legacy operations decreased due to higher losses at direct-to-consumer & international and lower results at media networks, partially offset by growth at parks, experiences and products.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 19%, or $9.7 billion, to $60.5 billion, due to the consolidation of tfcf and hulu's operations and to a lesser extent, growth at our legacy operations. the increase at our legacy operations was due to higher guest spending at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, higher theatrical distribution revenue and growth in merchandise licensing. these increases were partially offset by lower abc studios program sales. service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to the movement of the u.s. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (foreign exchange impact).
product revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5%, or $0.5 billion, to $9.0 billion, due to the consolidation of tfcf's operations and growth at our legacy operations. the increase at our legacy operations was due to guest spending growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
table of contents costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2019 increased 32%, or $8.9 billion, to $36.5 billion, due to the consolidation of tfcf and hulu's operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. the increase in costs at our legacy operations reflected higher programming and production costs, labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts and an increase in film cost amortization. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable foreign exchange impact.
cost of products for fiscal 2019 increased 7%, or $0.4 billion, to $5.6 billion, due to the consolidation of tfcf's operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. the increase in costs at our legacy operations was due to higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise and labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment volumes. cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable foreign exchange impact.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2019 increased 30%, or $2.7 billion, to $11.5 billion, due to the consolidation of tfcf and hulu's operations, and increases in marketing and compensation costs at our legacy operations. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to a favorable foreign exchange impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 38%, or $1.1 billion, to $4.2 billion due to amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of tfcf and consolidation of hulu.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $1.2 billion and $33 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. charges in fiscal 2019 were due to severance in connection with the acquisition and integration of tfcf. charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs.

the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances as a result of the tfcf acquisition and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. these increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest and a benefit from market value adjustments on pay-floating interest rate swap options.
the increase in interest income, investment income and other for the year was due to a $102 million benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and higher interest income on cash balances. the comparable benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs of $30 million in the prior year was reported in "costs and expenses." the benefit in the current year was due to the expected return on pension plan assets exceeding interest expense on plan liabilities and amortization of prior net actuarial losses.
equity in the loss of investees equity in the loss of investees of $103 million was comparable to the prior year as higher impairments in the current year were offset by lower equity losses from hulu as a result of our consolidation of hulu following the tfcf acquisition.

net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests       $(472     )       $(468     )   (1        )%
net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was comparable to the prior year as the accretion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in hulu (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and a lower loss allocation to the noncontrolling interest holders of bamtech were offset by a higher loss from our direct-to-consumer sports business.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.
discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the rsns.

table of contents offset by the comparison to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in bamtech, impairments of our vice and villages nature equity method investments in fiscal 2018 and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. the increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our studio entertainment, parks, experiences and products and media networks segments, partially offset by lower results at our direct-to-consumer & international segment. in addition, net income attributable to disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $4.0 billion, to $50.9 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased tv/svod distribution revenue and the consolidation of bamtech. in september 2017, the company increased its ownership in bamtech and began consolidating its results. these increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue.
product revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 3%, or $0.3 billion, to $8.6 billion, due to guest spending and volume growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable foreign exchange impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $2.2 billion, to $27.5 billion, due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and tv/svod distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of bamtech and higher costs at our theme parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus.
cost of products for fiscal 2018 increased 4%, or $0.2 billion, to $5.2 billion due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts. cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased 8%, or $0.7 billion, to $8.9 billion, due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of bamtech, costs incurred in connection with the tfcf acquisition and an increase in compensation costs.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 8%, or $0.2 billion, to $3.0 billion primarily due to depreciation of new attractions at our theme parks and resorts and the consolidation of bamtech. depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by gaap, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.
the following table reconciles income from continuing operations before income taxes to total segment operating income.

revenues the increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher average ticket prices, partially offset by decreases of 2% from lower attendance and 1% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. the decrease in attendance was due to lower attendance at shanghai disney resort. attendance at our domestic theme parks was comparable to the prior year.
parks & experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to an increase of 6% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower volumes.
the increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 2% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from an increase in average ticket prices for cruise line sailings and 1% from the consolidation of tfcf's operations.
merchandise licensing and retail revenue growth was due to increases of 3% from merchandise licensing, 1% from our retail stores, 1% from a favorable foreign exchange impact and 1% from our publishing business due to the consolidation of tfcf's operations. the increase in merchandise licensing revenues was primarily due to higher revenue from products based on toy story, an increase in guaranteed shortfall recognition and higher revenues from avengers and frozen merchandise. these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from products based on star wars and cars. higher revenues at our retail stores were due to an increase in online sales.
the increase in parks licensing and other revenue was due to the adoption of asc 606 and higher real estate sales. the adoption of asc 606 required certain cost reimbursements from licensees to be recognized as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses.

costs and expenses operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $237 million from $5,937 million to $6,174 million, cost of sales and distribution costs, which increased $154 million from $2,764 million to $2,918 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased $99 million from $2,370 million to $2,469 million. the increase in operating labor was due to inflation, including the impact of wage increases for union employees, partially offset by the comparison to a special domestic employee bonus that was recognized in fiscal 2018. the increase in cost of sales and distribution costs was driven by higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts. higher infrastructure costs were due to an increase in technology spending and costs for new guest offerings, including expenses associated with star wars: galaxy's edge. other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased $199 million, from $2,255 million to $2,454 million, due to the recognition of certain cost reimbursements from licensees as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $203 million from $2,930 million to $3,133 million primarily due to inflation and higher marketing spend at our parks and resorts.
segment operating income segment operating income increased 11%, or $663 million, to $6,758 million due to growth at our domestic theme parks and resorts and our consumer products businesses.

revenues the increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to increases of 6% from higher average ticket prices, 4% from attendance growth and 1% from a favorable foreign exchange impact. attendance growth included a favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of hurricanes irma and matthew at walt disney world resort.
parks & experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increases of 5% from higher average guest spending, 3% from volume growth and 2% from a favorable foreign exchange impact. volume growth included a benefit from the favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of hurricanes irma and matthew.
the increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 3% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 1% from a favorable foreign exchange impact, 1% from an increase in passenger cruise ship days and 1% from higher occupied hotel room nights. higher occupied hotel room nights were due to an increase at our international resorts, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic resorts, reflecting fewer available room nights at walt disney world resort due to room refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units.
merchandise licensing and retail revenues were lower primarily due to decreases of 2% from licensing, 2% from lower retail sales and 1% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. the decrease in revenue from licensing was driven by a decrease in licensee settlements and lower revenues from products based on frozen, cars and princess, partially offset by an increase from products based on mickey and minnie and avengers. lower retail revenue was driven by a decrease in comparable store sales at the disney stores, partially offset by higher online revenue. the decrease in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of star wars and moana merchandise in the fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher sales of mickey and minnie merchandise.
the increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to an increase in real estate rental and sponsorship revenues.

revenues the increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the release of four marvel titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two marvel titles in fiscal 2017. the marvel titles in fiscal 2018 were avengers: infinity war, black panther, thor: ragnarok and ant-man and the wasp, whereas fiscal 2017 included guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 and doctor strange. other significant titles in fiscal 2018 included star wars: the last jedi, incredibles 2 and coco, while fiscal 2017 included beauty and the beast, rogue one: a star wars story, pirates of the caribbean: dead men tell no tales and moana.
lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5% decrease from lower unit sales, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average net effective pricing. lower unit sales were driven by the success of moana and finding dory in fiscal 2017 compared to coco and cars 3 in fiscal 2018. the decrease was also driven by three live-action titles in fiscal 2017 as compared to two live-action titles in fiscal 2018 and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018. these decreases were partially offset by the release of three marvel titles and two lucasfilm titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two marvel titles and one lucasfilm title in fiscal 2017. the increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of blu-ray discs, partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles.
tv/svod distribution and other revenue reflected a 5% increase from tv/svod distribution and a 3% increase from stage plays. the increase in tv/svod distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by

table of contents new international agreements and the sale of star wars: the force awakens in fiscal 2018 with no comparable title in fiscal 2017. higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in fiscal 2018.
costs and expenses operating expenses include film cost amortization, which increased $625 million, from $2,562 million to $3,187 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $106 million, from $1,156 million to $1,262 million. higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues. higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage play production and theatrical distribution costs.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $337 million from $2,156 million to $2,493 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in fiscal 2018.

the increases in corporate and unallocated shared expenses from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 and from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 were due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of tfcf and higher compensation costs.
restructuring in connection with the acquisition of tfcf as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in connection with the acquisition of tfcf the company has begun implementing a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of tfcf. during fiscal 2019, we recorded charges of $1.2 billion, including $0.9 billion of severance and related costs in connection with the plan and $0.3 billion of equity-based compensation costs, primarily for tfcf awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the tfcf acquisition. these charges are recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income. although our plans are not yet finalized, we anticipate that the total severance and related costs could be on the order of $1.5 billion. the company may incur other restructuring costs, such as contract termination costs, but we expect these will not be material. for fiscal 2018, restructuring and impairment charges were not material.
the following table summarizes the changes in restructuring reserves related to tfcf integration efforts in fiscal 2019:

significant developments in november 2019, the company launched disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer streaming service with disney, pixar, marvel, star wars and national geographic branded programming in the u.s. and four other countries. further launches are planned for western europe in spring 2020, latin america in fall 2021, eastern europe starting in late 2020 and continuing in 2021, and various asia-pacific territories throughout 2020 and 2021. as we will use our branded film and television content on the disney+ service, we expect to forgo licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in tv/svod markets. in addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for disney+.
due to the circumstances in hong kong, we have seen a significant decrease in tourism from china and other parts of asia to hong kong disneyland resort. if current trends continue, hong kong disneyland resort's fiscal 2020 operating income could decrease by approximately $275 million compared to fiscal 2019.

operating activities continuing operations cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 decreased 58% or $8.3 billion to $6.0 billion compared to fiscal 2018 due to the payment of approximately $7.6 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of fox corporation in connection with the tfcf acquisition and the sale of the rsns acquired with tfcf, higher pension plan contributions and higher interest payments. lower operating cash flows at our dtci and media networks segments were largely offset by increases at parks, experiences and products and studio entertainment. the decreases at dtci and media networks were due to higher film and television spending and operating disbursements, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. the increases at studio entertainment and parks, experiences and products were due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. the increase at studio entertainment was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. the increase at parks, experiences and products was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by cost inflation and higher marketing expenses.
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16% or $2.0 billion to $14.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the tax act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at studio entertainment and parks, experiences and products, partially offset by lower operating cash flows at media networks and dtci and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in new york. the increase in operating cash flow at studio entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. parks, experiences and products cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs. lower operating cash flow at media networks was due to higher television production spending. the decrease in operating cash flow at dtci was due to higher operating cash disbursements.

capital expenditures for the parks, experiences and products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. the increase in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort, partially offset by lower spending on new attractions at disneyland resort, while the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort and disneyland resort, including star wars: galaxy's edge. the increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending at disneyland paris, while the decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to lower spending at shanghai disney resort and hong kong disneyland resort.
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.
capital expenditures at dtci primarily reflect investments in technology. the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on technology to support our dtc services.
capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was driven by investments in corporate facilities.
the company currently expects its fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of $4.9 billion due to increased spending on technology and facilities at dtci and corporate.
other investing activities the fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire tfcf less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to hulu prior to the consolidation of hulu.
the fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the september 2017 acquisition of an additional 42% of bamtech. cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million in fiscal 2018 reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to hulu.
the fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the january 2017 acquisition of additional interests in bamtech net of cash assumed upon the consolidation of bamtech. cash used in other investing activities of $71 million in fiscal 2017 reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions.
discontinued operations cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the rsns.

table of contents financing activities continuing operations cash used in financing activities was $0.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $8.8 billion in fiscal 2018. the net use of cash in the current year was due to $2.9 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from borrowing of $3.7 billion. the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to a net increase in borrowings in the current year compared to net repayments in the prior year ($3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018) and the absence of common stock repurchases in the current year (compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018), partially offset by acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in the current year ($1.4 billion in fiscal 2019).
cash used in financing activities was $8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017. the net use of cash in fiscal 2018 was due to $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion. cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases ($3.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in fiscal 2017) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2018 compared to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2017 ($2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 compared to $3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2017).
discontinued operations cash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the rsns.

we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of

table of contents september 28, 2019, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, standard and poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1, and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f1, respectively. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on september 28, 2019, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the asia theme parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september 28, 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we produce films and television series for distribution in the theatrical and television markets and on our dtc streaming services. we expense the production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g. the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, svod services and in home entertainment formats. alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on an accelerated or straight-line basis over the useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
we also acquire, license and produce films and television series for our direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. we expense these costs based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, which may be on an accelerated or straight-line basis, as appropriate.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program.
table of contents estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
for film and television series that are exploited on our direct-to-consumer streaming services, the unamortized costs are reviewed for impairment on an aggregate basis for each service.
fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and motion picture productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee. tv/svod distribution contracts may contain more than one title and/or provide that certain titles are only available for use during defined periods of time during the contract term. in these instances, each title and/or period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation. for these contracts, license fees are allocated to each title and period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management's best estimate. estimates used to determine a performance obligation's standalone selling price impact the timing of revenue recognition, but not the total revenue to be recognized under the arrangements.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. we have updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we reduced our discount rate to 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 from 4.31% at the end of fiscal 2018 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2019 year-end measurement date. the company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $313 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 28, 2019 by approximately $3.6 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $273 million and $3.0 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.25%. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $157 million.
goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. in addition, the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party. we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
table of contents the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.
the company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment. the impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material.
for fiscal 2019, the fair value of our international channels reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by less than 10%. our international channels reporting unit comprises the company's international cable networks that provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with mvpds. a majority of the operations in this reporting unit consist of businesses acquired in the tfcf acquisition and therefore the fair value approximates carrying value. goodwill of this reporting unit is approximately $3 billion. changes to key assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record an impairment charge.
the company has investments in equity securities. for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. if these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.
the company tested its investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $538 million and $210 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in "equity in the income (loss) of investees, net" in the consolidated statements of income. the fiscal 2017 impairment charges recorded were not material.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. from time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. the acquisition of tfcf increased the company's uncertain tax benefits as the company assumed the tax liabilities of tfcf. the company is still obtaining information related to the evaluation of the table of contents income tax impact of certain pre-acquisition transactions of tfcf which may result in adjustments to the recorded amount of uncertain tax benefits. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

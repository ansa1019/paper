recently adopted accounting standards in 2018, we adopted accounting standards codifications ("asc") 606, "revenue from contracts with customers". upon adoption, we determined we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we earn management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities. upon adoption of asc 606, we are required to allocate our revenues between our performance obligations. prior to the adoption of asc 606, the entire management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services. additionally, the expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our statement of operations effective january 1, 2018. (see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.)
recent accounting standards see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of recently adopted as well as other recently issued accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements if known.
operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the erie insurance exchange ("exchange"), a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange. we also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. each applicant for insurance to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we earn a management fee. management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2019, 2018 and 2017.  our board of directors set the 2020 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide to the exchange.  the policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 67% of our 2019 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2019 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2019 policy issuance and renewal expenses. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.
by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange with respect to its administrative services. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. the amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2019 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios.  our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  we actively evaluate the portfolios for impairments, and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and it is concluded that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.

nm = not meaningful operating income increased at a slower pace in 2019 compared to 2018 as growth in operating expenses outpaced the growth in operating revenues.  management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange.  the management fee rate was 25% for 2019, 2018, and 2017.  the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 5.2% to $7.5 billion in 2019 and 6.9% to $7.1 billion in 2018.  cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 5.5% in 2019 primarily due to higher commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth and higher investments in information technology. cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 4.0% in 2018 driven primarily by higher commissions. offsetting some of the increase in operating expenses in both periods were lower agent and employee incentive costs related to less profitable growth on the property and casualty insurance business of the exchange.
the administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $582.0 million and $580.3 million in 2019 and 2018, but had no net impact on operating income.
total investment income increased $14.2 million in 2019 driven primarily by net realized investment gains and higher net investment income. total investment income decreased $2.8 million in 2018 driven by lower earnings generated from limited partnership investments and higher net realized investment losses, partially offset by higher net investment income.
in 2019, income tax expense was reduced by $4.0 million as a result of settling an uncertain tax position, which decreased our effective tax rate by 1.0%. the decrease in income tax expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.  further, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues may impact the estimated loss reserves and future premium rates. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or continuing operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation available-for-sale securities we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments.  valuation techniques are used to derive the fair value of the available-for-sale securities we hold.  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
for purposes of determining whether the market is active or inactive, the classification of a financial instrument is based upon the following definitions:
•   an active market is one in which transactions for the assets being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information.
•   an inactive (illiquid) market is one in which there are few and infrequent transactions, where the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially, and/or there is little information publicly available for the asset being valued.
we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date re-evaluate the classification in the fair value hierarchy.  all assets carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
•   level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•   level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
level 1 reflects market data obtained from independent sources, such as prices obtained from an exchange or a nationally recognized pricing service for identical instruments in active markets and primarily includes preferred stock.
level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  financial instruments in this category primarily include u.s. government & agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, structured securities and preferred stock.
level 3 securities are valued based upon unobservable inputs, reflecting our estimates of value based upon assumptions used by market participants.  securities are also assigned to level 3 in cases where non-binding broker quotes are significant to the valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based upon information that is observable in the marketplace.  fair value estimates for securities valued using unobservable inputs require significant judgment due to the illiquid nature of the market for these securities and represent the best estimate of the fair value that would occur in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  fair value for these securities is generally valued using an estimate of fair value based upon indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based upon, nor corroborated by, market information, including the utilization of discounted cash flow analyses which have been risk-adjusted to take into account illiquidity and other market factors. this category primarily consists of corporate bonds and structured securities.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument.  our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.  we did not make any other significant judgments except as described above.
estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service.  our level 1 securities are valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service.  pricing service valuations for level 2 securities include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  pricing service valuations for level 3 securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available or in illiquid markets.
although virtually all of our prices are obtained from third party sources, we also perform internal pricing reviews, including evaluating the methodology and inputs used to ensure that we determine the proper classification level of the financial instrument and reviewing securities with price changes that vary significantly from current market conditions or independent third party price sources.  price variances are investigated and corroborated by market data and transaction volumes.  we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs and believe that the prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value.
in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when, in our judgment, a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and/or non-binding broker quotes.  in other circumstances, certain securities are internally priced because prices are not provided by the pricing service.
when a price from the pricing service is not available, values are determined by obtaining broker/dealer quotes and/or market comparables.  when available, we obtain multiple quotes for the same security.  the ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information.  our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.
other-than-temporary impairments available-for-sale securities are evaluated monthly for other-than-temporary impairment loss.  for securities that have experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost and that we intend to sell, or for which it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings. securities that have experienced a decline in fair value and that we do not intend to sell, and that we will not be required to sell before recovery, are evaluated to determine if the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. some factors considered in this evaluation include the extent and duration to which fair value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry based upon analysts' recommendations, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including a ratings downgrade, near term liquidity position of the issuer and compliance with financial covenants.
if a decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, an assessment is made to determine the amount of the total impairment related to a credit loss and that related to all other factors. consideration is given to all available information relevant to the collectability of the security in this determination. when the entire amortized cost basis of the security will not be recovered, a credit loss exists.  for securities with credit impairments that we did not intend to sell, the credit portion of the loss would be recorded through net income and the non-credit portion of the impairment would be recorded in other comprehensive income. currently, we have the intent to sell all of our securities that have been determined to have a credit-related impairment.  as a result, the entire amount of any impairment is recognized in earnings.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and the exchange's allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 19 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 3.59% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2019 and for the 2020 pension expense.  the same methodology was used to develop the 4.47% and 3.73% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the pension expense for 2019 and 2018, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $5.5 million, of which our share would be approximately $2.3 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $48.3 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls.  the expected long-term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions, as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  based on the current asset allocation and a review of the key factors and expectations of future asset performance, the expected return on asset assumption remained at 6.00% for 2020. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.1 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $0.9 million.
we use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2019 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a gain of $134.5 million. recognition of this gain will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
estimates of fair values of the pension plan assets are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian of our pension plan.  our level 1 category includes a money market mutual fund for which the fair value is determined using an exchange traded price provided by the trustee and custodian.  our level 2 category includes commingled pools.  estimates of fair values for securities held by our commingled pools are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian.  trustee and custodian valuation methodologies for level 2 securities include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuers spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data. there were no level 3 investments in 2019 or 2018.
we expect our net pension benefit costs to increase from $32.2 million in 2019 to $46.6 million in 2020 primarily due to the lower discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns during 2019. our share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements was $13.2 million in 2019. we expect our share of the net pension benefit costs to be approximately $19.1 million in 2020.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see part ii, item 8.

results of operations management fee revenue in 2018, we adopted asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers". upon adoption, we determined we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we earn management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities. upon adoption of asc 606, we are required to allocate our revenues between our performance obligations. prior to the adoption of asc 606, the entire management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services.
management fee rate the management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  the management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2019, 2018 and 2017.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly. the transaction price for management fee revenue and administrative service reimbursement revenue is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. we update the transaction price allocation annually based upon the most recent information available.
there was no material change to the allocation in 2019.
the following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:

(1)   management fees are returned to the exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded. we record an estimated allowance for management fees returned on mid-term policy cancellations. this estimated allowance has been allocated between the two performance obligations consistent with the revenue allocation proportion.
(2)   the allocation of management fee revenue between the two performance obligations beginning january 1, 2018 caused the growth in management fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services to not correspond directly with the growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange in 2019 and 2018, compared to 2017.
(3)   management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are performed. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements -
note 3, revenue, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.
direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 5.2% to $7.5 billion in 2019, from $7.1 billion in 2018, driven by increases in both policies in force and average premium per policy.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 1.8% in 2019 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention, compared to 3.3% in 2018.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 3.2% at december 31, 2019, compared to 3.5% at december 31, 2018.
premiums generated from new business decreased 2.6% to $863 million in 2019. while year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 5.1% at december 31, 2019, new business policies written decreased 7.4% in 2019. premiums generated from new business increased 4.7% to $886 million in 2018. while 2018 new business policies written decreased 1.4%, the year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 6.2% at december 31, 2018, driving this new business premium increase.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 6.4% to $6.6 billion in 2019, compared to 7.2%, or $6.2 billion, in 2018.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums were increases in average premium per policy and steady policy retention ratios. the renewal business year-over-year average premium per policy increased 2.9% at december 31, 2019, compared to 3.1% at december 31, 2018.
the exchange implemented rate increases in 2019, 2018, and 2017 in order to meet loss cost expectations.  as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be fully recognized in earned premiums.  since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  as a result, certain rate actions approved in 2018 were reflected in 2019, and recent rate actions in 2019 will be reflected in 2020. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 4.9% to $5.3 billion in 2019, from $5.0 billion in 2018, driven by an increase of 1.8% in total personal lines policies in force and an increase of 2.9% in the total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 6.1% to $2.2 billion in 2019, from $2.1 billion in 2018, driven by a 2.4% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 3.6% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
future trends-premium revenue - the exchange plans to continue its efforts to grow premiums and improve its competitive position in the marketplace.  expanding the size of its agency force through a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in our existing operating territories is expected to contribute to future growth as existing and new agents build their books of business.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affects the profitability of the exchange and has a direct bearing on our management fee.  our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models has contributed to the exchange's steady policy retention ratios and increased average premium per policy.  the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing, and attract new, subscribers/policyholders.  a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates.  the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products.  such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business.  we expect the exchange's pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in 2020; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average premium written and affiliated assumed by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.

policy issuance and renewal services we allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 24.2% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, for providing policy issuance and renewal services. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. the increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange discussed previously.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue includes service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing extended payment terms on policies written and affiliated assumed by the exchange, and late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  the decrease in service agreement revenue reflects the continued shift to payment plans that do not incur service charges or offer a premium discount for certain payment methods.

(1)   2018 and 2017 amounts have been reclassified between categories to conform to the current period presentation.
commissions - commissions increased $40.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and $36.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017. the increases in both periods resulted from higher direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, somewhat offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $39.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $5.7 million primarily due to increased underwriting report costs and other policy acquisition costs. information technology costs increased $23.1 million primarily due to increased professional fees and hardware and software costs. sales and advertising costs decreased $3.2 million due to decreased personnel costs. customer service costs increased $2.9 million primarily due to increased credit card processing fees and personnel costs. administrative and other expenses increased $11.1 million primarily driven by an increase in the long-term incentive plan costs due to a higher company stock price in 2019 compared to 2018 and several multi-year commitments made to support community development initiatives. personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by increased medical expenses, somewhat offset by lower estimated costs for incentive plans related to sales and underwriting performance in 2019 compared to targets.
in 2018, non-commission expense increased $19.7 million compared to 2017. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $8.1 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. information technology costs increased $5.2 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and professional fees. customer service costs increased $3.6 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees. personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by additional bonuses awarded to all employees as a result of tax savings realized from the lower corporate income tax rate that became effective january 1, 2018 as well as increased medical costs. the total increase in personnel costs was somewhat offset by lower estimated costs for incentive plan awards related to underwriting performance.

nm = not meaningful net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios, net of investment expenses. net investment income increased by $3.2 million in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalent and agent loan interest income reflecting higher invested balances and rates, somewhat offset by decreased income on fixed maturities due to lower invested balances and yields. net investment income increased by $5.6 million in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalent income due to an increase in rates, and an increase in bond income due to higher investment yields.

net realized investment gains (losses)          $6,103             $(2,010   )          $1,334
net realized gains of $6.1 million in 2019 were primarily due to gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and increases in fair value of equity securities. net realized losses of $2.0 million in 2018 were due to losses from sales of available-for-sale and equity securities and decreases in fair value of equity securities, while gains of $1.3 million in 2017 were primarily due to gains from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
net impairment losses recognized in earnings net impairment losses recognized in earnings in all three years included securities in an unrealized loss position that we intended to sell prior to expected recovery of our amortized cost basis as well as securities in an unrealized loss position where we determined the loss was other-than-temporary based on credit factors.
equity in earnings (losses) of limited partnerships equity in earnings of limited partnerships increased by $1.5 million in 2019, compared to 2018, and decreased by $3.6 million in 2018, compared to 2017. the increase in earnings in 2019 was primarily the result of higher earnings in real estate investments. the decrease in earnings in 2018 was the result of lower earnings in all sectors.
financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best company. higher ratings of insurance companies generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior". on june 24, 2019, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable. according to a.m. best, this second highest financial strength rating category is assigned to those companies that, in a.m. best's opinion, have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. only approximately 12% of insurance groups are rated a+ or higher, and the exchange is included in that group.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 5.2% to $7.5 billion in 2019 from $7.1 billion in 2018. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $9.5 billion and $8.6 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.0% at december 31, 2019 and 90.1% at december 31, 2018.

we continually review our investment portfolio to evaluate positions that might incur other-than-temporary declines in value. we record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.  for all investment holdings, general economic conditions and/or conditions specifically affecting the underlying issuer or its industry, including downgrades by the major rating agencies, are considered in evaluating impairment in value.  in addition to specific factors, other factors considered in our review of investment valuation are the length of time and the amount the fair value is below cost.
we individually analyze all positions with emphasis on those that have, in our opinion, declined significantly below cost.  in compliance with current impairment guidance for available-for-sale securities, we perform further analysis to determine if a credit-related impairment has occurred.  some of the factors considered in determining whether a security is credit impaired include potential for the default of interest and/or principal, level of subordination, collateral of the issue, compliance with financial covenants, credit ratings and industry conditions.  we have the intent to sell all credit-impaired securities; therefore, the entire amount of the impairment charges are included in earnings and no impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income.  we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of other-than-temporary impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector.  this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.  as part of a rebalancing of our portfolio, we began selling off our municipal bond portfolio in 2018 and completed the process in 2019.  the proceeds were reinvested in corporate debt and structured securities as well as preferred stock.
fixed maturities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, amounted to $4.5 million at december 31, 2019, compared to net unrealized losses of $7.0 million at december 31, 2018.

shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. at december 31, 2019, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $1.7 million, net of tax, of which $4.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss offset by $3.2 million of current period actuarial loss.  the 2019 actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 3.59% in 2019, from 4.47% in 2018. at december 31, 2018, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $35.7 million, net of tax, of which $10.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $24.8 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2018 actuarial gain was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 4.47% in 2018, from 3.73% in 2017. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
home office expansion in 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $100 million senior secured draw term loan credit facility ("credit facility") for the acquisition of real property and construction of an office building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. on january 1, 2019, the credit facility converted to a fully-amortized term loan with monthly payments of principal and interest at a fixed rate of 4.35% over a period of 28 years. we capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction period of long-term building projects as part of the historical cost of the asset.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, and the purchase and development of information technology.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from other sources even if market volatility persists throughout 2020.

net cash provided by operating activities was $364.5 million in 2019, compared to $263.6 million in 2018 and $197.1 million in 2017.  increased cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in management fee revenue received driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange compared to 2018, along with no pension contribution in 2019. in 2018, our board approved an $80 million accelerated pension contribution which was made in 2018. we are reimbursed approximately 59% of the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plans from the exchange and its subsidiaries, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions. also, cash paid for agent bonuses decreased $18.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to less profitable underwriting results. in 2018, increased cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in management fee revenue received driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange along with a decrease in income taxes paid due to the lower corporate income tax rate effective january 1, 2018, compared to 2017.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $124.6 million in 2019, compared to $81.4 million in 2018 and $74.7 million in 2017. in 2019, we generated more proceeds from investment activity, which were offset by higher purchases of available-for-sale securities and equity securities due to portfolio rebalancing. fixed asset purchases also increased primarily related to the home office expansion. we have a commitment for the remaining costs related to the construction of the building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. of the total expected cost of $113 million, which was funded primarily by the senior secured draw term loan credit facility, $88.9 million of costs have been paid as of december 31, 2019. the increase in cash used in 2018, compared to 2017, was driven by increased agent loans and fixed asset purchases primarily related to the home office expansion. these increases were somewhat offset by more proceeds generated from investment activity and efl's repayment of the $25 million surplus note.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $169.6 million in 2019, compared to $131.5 million in 2018 and $95.8 million in 2017.  the increase in cash used in 2019, compared to 2018, was due to an increase in dividends paid to shareholders and principal payments on the senior secured draw term loan credit facility, which commenced january 1, 2019. future financing activities will include annual principal payments, of which $2.0 million will be paid in 2020. the increase in cash used in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the lower scheduled draws on the senior secured draw term loan credit facility along with an increase in dividends paid to shareholders.
no shares of our class a nonvoting common stock were repurchased in 2019, 2018 and 2017 in conjunction with our stock repurchase program. in 2011, our board of directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of $150 million with no time limitation.  this repurchase authority includes, and is not in addition to, any unspent amounts remaining under the prior authorization.  we had approximately $17.8 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at december 31, 2019, based upon trade date.
in 2019, 2018 and 2017, we purchased shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program for certain stock-based incentive plans. we purchased 15,003 shares for $2.6 million in 2019 and 27,120 shares for $3.2 million in 2018 for our equity compensation plan and to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan and the incentive compensation deferral plan. in 2017, we purchased 60,332 shares for $7.3 million for our long-term incentive plan, to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan, and for our equity compensation plan. all shares were delivered in the year they were purchased.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $336.7 million at december 31, 2019, 2) a $100 million bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including preferred and common stock and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $465.2 million at december 31, 2019.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2019, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on october 30, 2023. as of december 31, 2019, a total of $99.1 million remains available under the facility due to $0.9 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24.1 million.  we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of december 31, 2019. investments with a fair value of $110.1 million were pledged as collateral on the line at december 31, 2019. these securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities and cash and cash equivalents in the statements of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions.  we were in compliance with our bank covenants at december 31, 2019.

(1)   long-term debt amount differs from the balance presented on the statements of financial position as the amount in the table above includes interest and principal payments.
(2)   we agreed to the guaranteed maximum price terms of an agreement with our construction manager for the construction of the office building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. substantial completion of the project is expected in 2020. this project is primarily being funded by the senior secured draw term loan credit facility included in long-term debt in the table above. included in these amounts are obligations for furniture and fixtures and information technology costs for the office building.
(3)   operating leases represent the total commitment for the lease components of our operating lease agreements. non-lease component commitments related to these contracts are included in other commitments. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies and note 8, leases, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.
(4)   other commitments include various agreements for services, including information technology, support, and maintenance obligations, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction. the table above also includes agreements that contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee. the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above as we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms.
(5)   the obligation for our unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan (serp) for our executive and senior management is not included in gross contractual obligations. the accumulated benefit obligation for this plan at december 31, 2019 is $23.4 million. we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the future benefit payments as these become due.
(6)   we are reimbursed from the exchange and its subsidiaries for a portion of the costs related to other commitments and operating leases.
our funding policy for our defined benefit pension plan is generally to contribute an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year, or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100%. historically, this has resulted in an annual pension contribution. in 2018, however, we made accelerated pension contributions totaling $80 million. following our 2018 contribution, we would not expect to make a subsequent contribution until the sum of the target normal costs for plan years beginning on and after december 31, 2017 exceeds $80 million, or earlier if a contribution is necessary to fund the plan to 100%.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements include those with unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations, including material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that conduct certain activities.  we have no material off-balance sheet obligations.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see item 1a "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.
transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  as a consequence, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders, such as setting the management fee rate paid by the exchange to us and ratifying any other significant intercompany activity.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property & casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company. indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
all transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.
intercompany agreements subscriber's and services agreements we serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we earn a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the attorney-in-fact. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the amounts incurred for all administrative services are reimbursed to indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements. these reimbursements are settled on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
leased property we lease the home office from the exchange. rent is based on rental rates of like property in erie, pennsylvania and all operating expenses including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, and property insurance are the responsibility of the tenant (indemnity). rental costs of shared facilities are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied. we also had a lease commitment with efl for a field office until 2018.
we previously owned three field offices for which rental costs of shared facilities were allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied. in 2018, we sold the three field offices to the exchange at the current independent appraised value in order to align the ownership interest of these facilities with the functions being performed at these locations, which are claims-related activities.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations.  allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.
intercompany receivables we have significant receivables from the exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk.  receivables from the exchange and other affiliates were $468.6 million, or 23.2% of total assets, at december 31, 2019 and $449.9 million, or 25.3% of total assets, at december 31, 2018. these receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously. these receivables from the exchange and its affiliates are settled monthly. we continually monitor the financial strength of the exchange. given the financial strength of the exchange and historical experience of no credit losses, we believe it is unlikely these receivables would have a significant credit loss exposure.
surplus note we previously held a $25 million surplus note issued to us by efl that was payable on demand on or after december 31, 2018. in 2018, efl, with the appropriate approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner, satisfied its obligation and repaid the surplus note. efl paid related interest to us of $1.6 million in 2018 and $1.7 million in 2017.

results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) senior housing triple-net, (ii) shop, (iii) life science, and (iv) medical office. our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triple-net leases and ridea structures. under the life science and medical office segments, we invest through the acquisition and development of life science facilities and mobs, which generally require a greater level of property management. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of our debt investments, hospital properties, and unconsolidated joint ventures. we evaluate performance based upon: (i) property net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") and (ii) adjusted noi (cash noi) in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, and income from direct financing leases), less property level operating expenses (which exclude transition costs); noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unlevered basis. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." noi and adjusted noi exclude our share of income (loss) generated by unconsolidated joint ventures, which is recognized in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same property portfolio ("spp"), as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi. noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items. further, our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
same property portfolio spp noi and adjusted (cash) noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties. spp noi excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure, such as a transition from a triple-net lease to a ridea reporting structure, are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations, or a change in reporting structure has been agreed to (such as triple-net to shop).
for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted, each of which is described in detail below. we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
nareit ffo. ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro-rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro-rata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro-rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro-rata financial information as a supplement.
nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
ffo as adjusted. in addition, we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets, losses (gains) from the sale of non-depreciable assets, severance and related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains), and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
funds available for distribution ("fad")
fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of deferred compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, (v) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (vi) non-cash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (vii) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (viii) deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, fad: (i) is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and (ii) includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc non-refundable entrance fees. certain prior period amounts in the "non-gaap financial measures reconciliation" below for fad have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. more specifically, recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("fad capital expenditures") excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in "other fad adjustments"). adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of fad for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our fad to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods (reported in "other fad adjustments"). see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad, and accordingly, our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits, management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. we believe fad is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods, and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, (iv) severance-related expenses, and (v) actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable (in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude non-cash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases). furthermore, fad is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. fad is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to fad and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

_______________________________________
(1)   for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares ("net income (loss)") decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a reduction in noi as a result of asset sales during 2018 and 2019;
•   a larger net gain on sales of real estate during 2018 compared to 2019, primarily related to the sale of our shoreline technology center life science campus in november 2018;
•   increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2018 and 2019, (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2018 and 2019, and (iii) the conversion of 14 senior housing triple-net assets from a dfl to a ridea structure in 2019, partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization from asset sales during 2018 and 2019;
•   an increase in loss on debt extinguishments, resulting from redemptions and repurchases of senior unsecured notes in 2019; and
•   increased impairment charges on real estate asset recognized during 2019 compared to 2018.
the decrease in net income (loss) was partially offset by:
•   increased noi from: (i) annual rent escalations, (ii) 2018 and 2019 acquisitions, and (iii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2018 and 2019;
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments during 2018 and 2019; and
•   an increase in other income, primarily resulting from: (i) a gain on deconsolidation of 19 shop assets in 2019, and (ii) a loss on consolidation of seven care homes in the u.k. during the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by a gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in three life science joint ventures in november 2018.
nareit ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss), except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•   gains on sales of real estate, including related tax impacts;
•   depreciation and amortization expense;
•   impairments charges on real estate assets; and
•   gains and losses on change in control.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting nareit ffo, except for losses on debt extinguishment, which are excluded from ffo as adjusted.
fad decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which is excluded from fad. the decrease in fad was also partially due to increased fad capital expenditures during 2019.

net income (loss) applicable to common shares ("net income (loss)") increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   a larger net gain on sales of real estate during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily related to the sale of our shoreline technology center life science campus in november 2018;
•   increased noi from: (i) annual rent escalations, (ii) 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, and (iii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2017 and 2018;
•   a gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in three life science joint ventures in november 2018;
•   impairments of our mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care (the "tandem mezzanine loan") in 2017;
•   a net charge to noi from the november 2017 transactions with brookdale (the "2017 brookdale transactions")(see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements);
•   a reduction in interest expense as a result of debt repayments, primarily in the second and third quarters of 2017 and throughout 2018, partially offset by an increased average balance under our revolving facility during 2018;
•   higher income tax expense in 2017 related to the impact of new tax rate legislation, partially offset by tax benefits from higher sales volume during 2017;
•   a reduction in litigation-related costs from securities class action litigation, and a one-time legal settlement in 2017;
•   a reduction in loss on debt extinguishment related to repurchases of our senior unsecured notes in july 2018 compared to july 2017; and
•   casualty-related charges incurred due to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.
the increase in net income (loss) was partially offset by:
•   a reduction in noi in our senior housing triple-net segment, primarily as a result of the sale of senior housing triple-net assets and the transition of senior housing triple-net assets to shop during 2017 and 2018;
•   a reduction in noi in our shop segment, primarily as a result of occupancy declines and higher labor costs;
•   a loss on consolidation of seven care homes in the u.k. during the first quarter of 2018;
•   a reduction in income related to the gain on sale of our £138.5 million par value four seasons health care's senior notes (the "four seasons notes") during 2017;
•   increased impairment charges on real estate asset recognized during 2018 compared to 2017;
•   a reduction in income as a result of: (i) asset sales during 2017 and 2018 and (ii) selling interests into the u.k. jv and a joint venture with morgan stanley real estate investments ("msrei mob jv")(see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements);
•   a reduction in interest income due to the: (i) payoff of our hc-one mezzanine loan (the "hc-one facility") in june 2017 and (ii) sale of our tandem mezzanine loan in march 2018;
•   increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2017 and 2018 and (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2017 and 2018, primarily in our life science and medical office segments, partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization from asset sales during 2017 and 2018;
•   a reduction in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures as a result of the sale of our equity method investment in ridea ii in june 2018, partially offset by additional equity income from the u.k. jv; and
•   an increase in severance and related charges during 2018 primarily related to the departure of our former executive chairman compared to severance and related charges primarily related to the departure of our former chief accounting officer ("cao") in 2017.
nareit ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss), except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•   gains on sales of real estate, including related tax impacts;
•   depreciation and amortization expense;
•   impairments of facilities within our senior housing triple-net and shop segments; and
•   net gain on consolidation.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting nareit ffo, except for the following, which are excluded from ffo as adjusted:
•   the net charge to noi from the 2017 brookdale transactions;
•   the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017;
•   severance and related charges;
•   losses on debt extinguishments;
•   litigation-related costs;
•   casualty-related charges;
•   the gain on sale of our four seasons notes during the first quarter of 2017; and
•   the impairments of our tandem mezzanine loan in 2017 and an undeveloped life science land parcel in 2018.
fad decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which is excluded from fad. the decrease in fad was partially offset by lower fad capital expenditures.

spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations. the increase in adjusted noi was partially offset by rent reductions under the 2017 brookdale transactions.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following non-spp impacts:
•   decreased noi from senior housing triple-net facilities sold during 2017 and 2018; and

(2)   from our 2017 presentation of spp, we removed nine properties that were sold, eight shop properties that were placed into redevelopment and three shop properties that were classified as held for sale.
(3)   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for the 12-month period and a quarter in arrears from the periods presented.
spp adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•   occupancy declines and higher labor costs; partially offset by
•   increased rates for resident fees and services.
spp noi increased primarily as a result of the net charge for management fee terminations from the 2017 brookdale transactions, partially offset by the aforementioned decreases to spp adjusted noi.
total portfolio adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned impacts to spp and the following non-spp impacts:
•   decreased noi from our partial sale of ridea ii in the first quarter of 2017; and
•   decreased noi from shop assets sold in 2017 and 2018; partially offset by
•   increased noi from the transfer of 25 and 22 senior housing triple-net assets to our shop segment during 2017 and 2018, respectively.

(1)   total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties and properties that transitioned segments through the disposition or transition date.
(2)   from our 2018 presentation of spp, we removed seven mobs that were sold, two mobs that were placed into redevelopment, two mobs that were classified as held for sale, and one mob that we intend to demolish.
spp noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   mark-to-market lease renewals;
•   increased percentage-based rents; and
•   specific to adjusted noi, annual rent escalations.
total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to spp and the following non-spp impacts:
•   noi from our 2018 and 2019 acquisitions; and
•   increased occupancy in former development and redevelopment properties placed into service; partially offset by

interest income. the decrease in interest income for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily the result of: (i) the sale of our tandem mezzanine loan during the first quarter of 2018, (ii) the payoff of our hc-one facility in june 2017, and (iii) the conversion of the u.k. bridge loan into real estate during the first quarter of 2018.
interest expense. the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily the result of senior unsecured notes repurchases and redemptions during 2018.
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily the result of senior unsecured notes repurchases during 2017 and 2018, partially offset by an increased average balance under our revolving facility during 2018.
depreciation and amortization. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2018 and 2019, (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2018 and 2019 (primarily in our life science and medical office segments), and (iii) the conversion of 14 senior housing triple-net assets from a dfl to a ridea structure in 2019, partially offset by dispositions of real estate throughout 2018 and 2019.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily as a result of: (i) assets acquired during 2017 and 2018 (primarily in our life science and medical office segments) and (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed into operations during 2017 and 2018 (primarily in our life science and medical office segments), partially offset by dispositions of real estate throughout 2017 and 2018.
general and administrative expenses. the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily as a result of decreased severance and related charges, driven by the departure of our former executive chairman in march 2018, partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2019.
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily as a result of increased severance and related charges, primarily resulting from the departure of our former executive chairman in march 2018, which exceeded severance and related charges in 2017, primarily related to the departure of our former cao in the third quarter of 2017.
impairments (recoveries), net.  impairments (recoveries), net increased for the year ended december 31, 2019 as a result of committing to a formal plan to sell certain assets as part of a broader initiative to improve our portfolio quality and therefore, classifying those assets as held for sale. while some properties that are classified as held for sale are expected to result in a gain recognized upon disposition, others had a carrying value that exceeded the expected sale proceeds less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge during the respective period. the impairment charges recognized in each period vary depending on facts and circumstances related to each asset and are impacted by negotiations with potential buyers, current operations of the assets, market conditions, and other factors.
impairments (recoveries), net decreased for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the $144 million impairment charge recognized in 2017 related to our tandem mezzanine loan (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
gain (loss) on sales of real estate, net. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we sold: (i) our remaining interest in the u.k. jv, (ii) 18 shop facilities, (iii) 2 senior housing triple-net facilities, (iv) 10 mobs, (v) 1 life science asset, (vi) 1 undeveloped life science land parcel, and (vii) two facilities from the other non-reportable segment, and recognized total net gain on sales of $23 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we sold: (i) our remaining interest in ridea ii, (ii) a 51% interest in our u.k. portfolio, (iii) 31 shop facilities, (iv) 16 life science assets, (v) 13 senior housing triple-net facilities, and (vi) four mobs and recognized total net gain on sales of $926 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold: (i) 68 senior housing triple-net facilities, (ii) five life science facilities, (iii) five shop facilities, (iv) four mobs, and (v) a 40% interest in ridea ii, and recognized total net gain on sales of $357 million.
loss on debt extinguishments. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we repurchased or redeemed $1.65 billion of our senior unsecured notes and recognized an aggregate loss on debt extinguishment of $58 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repurchased $700 million of our 5.375% senior notes due 2021 and recognized a $44 million loss on debt extinguishment.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we repurchased $500 million of our 5.375% senior notes due 2021 and recognized a $54 million loss on debt extinguishment.
other income (expense), net. the increase in other income (expense), net for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily as a result of (i) a gain on deconsolidation recognized in 2019 related to a senior housing joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and (ii) a loss on consolidation of seven u.k. care homes in march 2018 (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in other income (expense), net was partially offset by a gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in three life science joint ventures in november 2018.
the decrease in other income (expense), net for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily as a result of: (i) a loss on consolidation of seven u.k. care homes in march 2018 (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) and (ii) a gain on sale of our four seasons notes in march 2017. the decrease in other income (expense), net was partially offset by: (i) a gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in three life science joint ventures in november 2018, (ii) casualty-related charges due to hurricanes incurred in the third quarter of 2017, and (iii) decreased litigation costs in 2018.
income tax benefit (expense). the increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, was primarily the result of: (i) a $17 million income tax expense related to the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017 and (ii) a $6 million income tax benefit related to our share of operating losses from our ridea joint ventures and u.k. real estate investments during 2018, partially offset by a $6 million benefit from the partial sale of ridea ii in 2017.
equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures. the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily the result of an impairment charge recognized related to one asset classified as held-for-sale in the ccrc jv (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and the sale of our equity method investment in ridea ii in june 2018, partially offset by additional equity income from our investment in the u.k. jv.
the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily the result of the sale of our equity method investment in ridea ii in june 2018, partially offset by additional equity income from our investment in the u.k. jv.
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements; and (iii) satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members. distributions were made using a combination of cash flows from operations, funds available under our revolving line of credit, proceeds from the sale of properties, and other sources of cash available to us.
our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•   fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs and
•   fund future acquisition, transactional and development activities.
we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following:
•   cash flow from operations;
•   sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments;
•   borrowings under our facilities and commercial paper program;
•   issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or
•   issuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent.
access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. for example, our revolving facility and 2019 term loan accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of february 10, 2020, we had long-term credit ratings of baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p global and fitch, and short-term credit ratings of p-2, a-2 and f2 from moody's, s&p global, and fitch, respectively.

operating cash flows operating cash flow decreased $3 million between the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 primarily as the result of: (i) dispositions during 2018 and 2019 and (ii) occupancy declines and higher labor costs within our shop segment. the decrease in operating cash flow is partially offset by: (i) 2018 and 2019 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2018 and 2019, and (iv) decreased interest paid as a result of debt repayments during 2018 and 2019. our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors.
operating cash flow increased $2 million between the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily as the result of: (i) 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2017 and 2018, and (iv) decreased interest paid as a result of debt repayments during 2017 and 2018. the increase in operating cash flow is partially offset by: (i) dispositions during 2017 and 2018, (ii) the partial sale and deconsolidation of the u.k. jv in 2018, (iii) the partial sale and deconsolidation of ridea ii during the first quarter of 2017, (iv) occupancy declines and higher labor costs within our shop segment, (v) decreased interest received as a result of loan repayments during 2017, and (vi) decreased distributions of earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures.

debt bank line of credit, term loans and commercial paper program in may 2019, we entered into the revolving facility, a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility maturing on may 23, 2023. the revolving facility contains two, six-month extension options, subject to certain customary conditions. additionally, in may 2019, we entered into the 2019 term loan, a new $250 million unsecured term loan facility and we borrowed the full $250 million capacity in june 2019. the 2019 term loan matures on may 23, 2024. the facilities include a feature that allows us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to $750 million, subject to securing additional commitments.
in september 2019, we established the commercial paper program. under the terms of the commercial paper program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured short-term debt securities with varying maturities. amounts available under the commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $1.0 billion. amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program will be sold on terms that are customary for the u.s. commercial paper market and will be at least equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. we intend to use the revolving facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of unsecured short term debt securities issued under the commercial paper program.

an aggregate of 30.4 million shares of our common stock, sold at an initial weighted average net price of $33.05 per share, after commissions, remain available for issuance under forward sales agreements as of december 31, 2019.

(2)   excludes mortgage debt on assets held for sale and mortgage debt from unconsolidated joint ventures.
(3)   represents commitments to finance development projects.
(4)   represents our commitments, as lessor, under signed leases and contracts for operating properties and includes allowances for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. excludes allowances for tenant improvements related to developments in progress for which we have executed an agreement with a general contractor to complete the tenant improvements (recognized in the "development commitments" line).
(5)   represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress and includes allowances for tenant improvements of $88 million that we have provided as a lessor.
(6)   interest on variable-rate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31, 2019.
off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. in addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under "contractual obligations".
inflation our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the consumer price index or other measures, and/or additional rent based on increases in the tenants' operating revenues. most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. substantially all of our senior housing triple-net, life science, and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily relates to the gain related to the deconsolidation of 19 previously consolidated shop assets that were contributed into a new unconsolidated senior housing joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund. for the year ended december 31, 2019, also includes the gain related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in a previously unconsolidated senior housing joint venture. for the year ended december 31, 2018, represents the gain related to the acquisition of our partner's interests in four previously unconsolidated life science assets, partially offset by the loss on consolidation of seven u.k. care homes.
(2)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, represents income tax expense associated with the state built-in gain tax payable upon the disposition of specific real estate assets, of which $49 million relates to the hcr manorcare, inc. ("hcrmc") real estate portfolio that we spun-off in 2016.
(3)   for the year ended december 31, 2019, includes a $6 million impairment charge related to depreciable real estate held by the ccrc jv, which we recognized in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.
(4)   for the year ended december 31, 2017, includes $55 million of net non-cash charges related to the right to terminate certain triple-net leases and management agreements in conjunction with the 2017 brookdale transactions. for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relates to the spin-off of quality care properties, inc.
(5)   for the year ended december 31, 2019, represents the impairment of 13 senior housing triple-net facilities under dfls recognized as a result of entering into sales agreements. for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily relates to the impairment of an undeveloped life science land parcel classified as held for sale, partially offset by an impairment recovery upon the sale of a mezzanine loan investment in march 2018. for the year ended december 31, 2017, relates to $144 million of impairments on our tandem mezzanine loan, net of a $51 million impairment recovery upon the sale of our four seasons notes. for the year ended december 31, 2015, include impairment charges of: (i) $1.3 billion related to our hcrmc dfl investments, (ii) $112 million related to our four seasons notes and (iii) $46 million related to our equity investment in hcrmc, partially offset by an impairment recovery of $6 million related to a loan payoff.
(6)   for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily relates to the departure of our former executive chairman and corporate restructuring activities. for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily relates to the departure of our former cao. for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily relates to the departure of our former president and chief executive officer. for the year ended december 31, 2015, relates to the departure of our former chief investment officer.
(7)   for all periods presented, represents the premium associated with the prepayment of senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt.
(8)   for all periods presented, relates to costs from securities class action litigation and a legal settlement. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(9)   for the year ended december 31, 2019, represents incremental insurance proceeds related to hurricanes in 2017, net of evacuation costs related to hurricanes in 2019.
(10)   represents the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into legislation on december 22, 2017.

(13)   excludes $17 million of deferred tax expenses, which is included in tax rate legislation impact for the year ended december 31, 2017. additionally, the year ended december 31, 2017, excludes $1 million of deferred tax benefit from the casualty-related charges, which is included in casualty-related charges (recoveries), net.
(14)   primarily includes our share of fad capital expenditures from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by noncontrolling interests' share of fad capital expenditures from consolidated joint ventures. our equity investment in hcrmc was accounted for using the equity method, which required an elimination of dfl income that was proportional to our ownership in hcrmc. further, our share of earnings from hcrmc (equity income) increased for the corresponding elimination of related lease expense recognized at the hcrmc entity level, which we presented as a non-cash joint venture fad adjustment. beginning in january 2016, as a result of placing our equity investment in hcrmc on a cash basis method of accounting, we no longer eliminated our proportional ownership share of income from dfls to equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of healthpeak properties, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. we consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("vies") when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie. a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie.
we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether: (i) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) substantially all of an entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights, or (iii) the equity investors as a group lack any of the following: (a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity. criterion (iii) above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause. if neither of those criteria are met, the entity is a vie.
we continually assess whether events have occurred that require us to reconsider the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie. such events include, but are not limited to: (i) a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kick-out rights, (ii) a change to the capitalization structure of the entity, or (iii) acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control. when a reconsideration event occurs, we reassess whether the entity is a vie.
we also make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to:
•   which activities most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and our ability to direct those activities;
•our form of ownership interest;
•our representation on the entity's governing body;
•the size and seniority of our investment;
•our ability to manage our ownership interest relative to other interest holders; and
•   our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager, and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable.
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. when we perform a reassessment of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie. we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides. if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, it may adversely impact the quality and/or timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting.
revenue recognition lease classification at the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. for leases entered into prior to january 1, 2019, a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property's economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) is equal to 90% or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset. if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible, the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl.
concurrent with our adoption of accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2016-02, leases ("asu 2016-02") on january 1, 2019, we began classifying a lease entered into subsequent to adoption as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee by the end of the lease term, (ii) lessee has a purchase option during or at the end of the lease term that it is reasonably certain to exercise, (iii) the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments is equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (v) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to us at the end of the lease term.
if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different, our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different; thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted, which may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
rental and related revenues we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is probable and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset. if the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. when we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment. if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted.
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and, to a certain extent, is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
resident fees and services resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges, community fees and other resident charges. residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year, with resident fees billed monthly, in advance. revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears.
certain of our ccrcs are operated as entrance fee communities, which typically require a resident to pay an upfront entrance fee that includes both a refundable portion and non-refundable portion. when we receive a nonrefundable entrance fee, it is recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into revenue over the estimated stay of the resident.
credit losses we continuously assess the collectibility of operating lease straight-line rent receivables. if it is no longer probable that substantially all future minimum lease payments will be received, the straight-line rent receivable balance is written off and recognized as a decrease in revenue in that period. we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis. this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements, and other factors. we exercise judgment in this assessment and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. these estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
loans receivable and dfls (collectively, "finance receivables"), are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing, watch list, or workout. finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations, and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured. watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout. workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined, based on current information and events, that: (i) it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement, (ii) the tenant, operator, or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement, and (iii) we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment.
finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured (the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout). further, we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant's, operator's, borrower's, and/or guarantor's repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values. we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting: (i) if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable, net of associated allowances or charge-offs (if any) or (ii) we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable. for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received, excluding principal paydowns, to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms. for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment. generally, we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured.
prior to the adoption of asu no. 2016-13, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments ("asu 2016-13") on january 1, 2020, allowances were established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses, if they were determined to be impaired. finance receivables are impaired when it is was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. an allowance was based upon our assessment of the lessee's or borrower's overall financial condition, economic resources, payment record, the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if appropriate, the net realizable value of any collateral. these estimates considered all available evidence, including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. if a finance receivable was deemed partially or wholly uncollectible, the uncollectible balance was charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made.
subsequent to adopting asu 2016-13 on january 1, 2020, we began using a loss model that relies on future expected credit losses, rather than incurred losses, as was required under historical u.s. gaap. under the new model, we are required to recognize future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of a financing receivable at inception of that instrument. the model emphasized historical experience and future market expectations to determine a loss to be recognized at inception. however, the model continues to be applied on an individual basis and rely on counter-party specific information to ensure the most accurate estimate is recognized.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land, and in-place leases. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired in-place leases.
certain of our acquisitions involve the assumption of contract liabilities. we typically estimate the fair value of contract liabilities by applying a reasonable profit margin to the total discounted estimated future costs associated with servicing the contract. we consider a variety of market and contract-specific conditions when making assumptions that impact the estimated fair value of the contract liability.
a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and other costs incurred during the period of development. we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements.
assets held for sale the company classifies a real estate property as held for sale when: (i) management has approved the disposal, (ii) the property is available for sale in its present condition, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, (iv) it is probable that the property will be disposed of within one year, (v) the property is being marketed at a reasonable price relative to its fair value, and (vi) it is unlikely that the disposal plan will significantly change or be withdrawn. if an asset is classified as held for sale, it is reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and no longer depreciated.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probability-weighted to reflect multiple possible cash-flow scenarios, including selling the assets at various points in the future. additionally, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we make assumptions regarding external market conditions (including capitalization rates and growth rates), forecasted cash flows and sales prices, and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
determining the fair value of real estate assets, including assets classified as held-for-sale, involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates, comparable market transactions, estimated per-unit or per square foot prices, negotiations with prospective buyers, and forecasted cash flows (lease revenue rates, expense rates, growth rates, etc.). our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based on the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture. if an equity-method investment shows indicators of impairment, we compare the fair value of the investment to the carrying value. if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is other-than-temporary involves significant judgment. our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, severity and duration of a fair value deficiency, and other relevant factors. capitalization rates, discount rates, and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based on rates we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements. our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal, state, and local tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a reit, (iii) the potential for built-in gain recognition, and (iv) changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards.

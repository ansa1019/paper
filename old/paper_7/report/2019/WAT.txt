the company's net sales decreased approximately 1% in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased 5% in 2018 as compared to 2017. foreign currency translation decreased sales by 2% in 2019 and increased sales by 1% in 2018. unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year.
instrument system sales decreased 4% and increased 2% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. in 2019, the decrease in instrument system sales was primarily driven by weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions and governmental policy changes. in 2018, the increase in instrument system sales was primarily driven by an increase in demand for lc and ta's instrument systems. foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1% in 2019 and increased instrument system sales by 1% in 2018. recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 3% and 8% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales. recurring revenues were impacted by foreign currency, which decreased sales by 2% in 2019 and increased sales by 2% in 2018.
geographically, the decline in the company's sales in 2019 was a result of increased sales in the u.s., canada, japan and the rest of asia being offset by a decrease in sales in other geographies on weaker demand for our products due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions, primarily from brexit as well as latin america, and governmental policy changes in china. in addition, the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2% overall. the company's sales growth in 2018 was primarily driven by the 7% sales growth in asia, with china's sales growing 15%.
sales in europe decreased 4% in 2019 and increased 4% in 2018. in 2019, europe sales were impacted by weak demand in western europe caused by the political uncertainties of brexit and the effect of foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 4% in 2019 and increased sales by 3% in 2018.
sales in the americas decreased 1% in 2019 and increased 3% in 2018. the americas sales in 2019 were negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions in latin america, and the 2018 americas sales growth can be attributed to the increase in sales after the lower customer demand stemming from the 2017 natural disasters in the u.s., mexico and puerto rico.
sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat in 2019 and grew 5% in 2018. sales to pharmaceutical customers in 2019 were negatively impacted by the lower customer demand in china for our instrument systems as a result of changes in governmental policy and lower sales in latin america. despite the sales declines in china and latin america, the need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and complex biologic drugs increased in the rest of the world.
combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, declined 2% in 2019 and grew 2% in 2018. the 2019 industrial customer sales were negatively impacted by a 6% decline in ta instrument system sales and a 1% decline from the effect of foreign currency translation.
combined sales to academic and governmental customers increased 2% in 2019 and 8% in 2018, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 1% in 2019 and increasing sales by 1% in 2018. sales to academic and governmental customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales growth rates can vary significantly from period to period.
operating income was $708 million in 2019, a decrease of 4% as compared to 2018. this decrease can be attributed to lower sales volume, the effect of foreign currency translation and $10 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in early 2019, offset by lower variable incentive compensation costs.
27
operating income increased 12% in 2018 as compared to 2017. this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2018, as well as the effect of approximately $33 million of facility closure, litigation and intellectual property payment charges from 2017 that did not recur in 2018.
the company's effective tax rates were 12.7%, 13.0% and 96.8% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net income per diluted share was $8.69, $7.65 and $0.25 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in 2018, the company settled a pension plan obligation and incurred a $46 million expense which reduced the net income per diluted share by $0.39. in 2017, the company incurred a $550 million income tax provision related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("2017 tax act") which reduced the net income per diluted share by $6.82, and excluding the 2017 tax act income tax provision, the company's effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 11.0%.
the company generated $643 million, $604 million and $698 million of net cash flows from operations in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in operating cash flow in 2019 was primarily a result of payments made in 2018 that did not recur, including $103 million of income tax payments made in the u.s. relating to the company's estimated 2017 transition tax liability and 2018 estimated tax payments, a $15 million litigation settlement payment and $11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans. included in the 2019 net cash flow from operations is $29 million of income tax payments made in the u.s. in relation to the 2017 transition tax liability. over the next three years, the company is required to make annual u.s. federal tax payments of approximately $38 million to tax authorities in connection with the company's estimated remaining transition tax liabilities of $404 million under the 2017 tax act. the final 60% of the total liability is required to be paid over a three-year period beginning in 2023.
cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $164 million, $96 million and $85 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in 2019, $68 million of capital expenditures paid related to the expansion of the company's precision chemistry consumable operations in the u.s. the company has incurred $85 million of costs for this facility through the end of 2019. in 2018, the company acquired the sole intellectual property rights to the desorption electrospray ionization ("desi") imaging technology for $30 million in cash and a future contractual obligation to pay a minimum royalty of $3 million over the remaining life of the patent. desi is a mass spectrometry imaging technique that is used to develop medical therapies.
in january 2019, the company's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company repurchased 11.1 million, 6.8 million and 1.8 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock at a cost of $2.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $323 million, respectively, under the january 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. as of december 31, 2019, the company has a total of $1.7 billion authorized for future repurchases. the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the company's sales and profits.
in september 2019, the company issued fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, of which $200 million of the outstanding notes matures in seven years and the remaining $300 million matures in 10 years. the company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.
during 2019 and 2018, the company entered into $260 million and $300 million, respectively, of u.s.-to-euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the company's net investment in its euro denominated net assets, bringing the total currency interest rate cross-currency swap agreement notional value to $560 million at december 31, 2019. as a result of entering into these agreements, the company lowered its net interest expense by $12 million and $3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. the company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $15 million in 2020, $11 million in 2021 and $1 million in 2022 as the three-year term of the agreements expire.
28
in january 2020, the company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3% of the company's employees. the company expects to incur approximately $25 million of severance costs, lease termination costs and other related costs during 2020.
in january 2020, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire andrew alliance, an innovator in specialty laboratory automation technology, including software and robotics for approximately $80 million. this acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on the company sales and expenses in 2020.

in 2019, sales in china were negatively impacted by economic uncertainty caused by certain regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets. the 4% increase in sales in japan was driven by instrument systems, primarily to pharmaceutical and academic and governmental customers, as well as foreign currency translation, which increased japan's sales by 2% in 2019. sales growth in asia other was due primarily to pharmaceutical and academic and governmental customer classes in 2019. sales in the u.s. increased by 1% despite large pharmaceutical customers slowing capital spending on our instrument systems. sales declines in the rest of the americas and europe were broad-based across all product and customer classes due to macroeconomic conditions and political instability, except in europe where sales to academic and governmental customers grew 8%. sales in europe were also negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 4% in 2019.
in 2018, sales in china increased across all product lines and were driven by double-digit increases in sales to pharmaceutical, academic and governmental customers. the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in japan by 2% in 2018 and sales growth was also driven by increased sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers. the sales decline in asia other in 2018 was a result of lower customer demand in india and weaker sales to environmental customers in the first quarter of 2018. in 2018, sales growth in europe was driven by ta's products and services and recurring revenues to pharmaceutical and industrial customers. in addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in europe by 3% in 2018. sales growth in the u.s. in 2018 was driven by recurring revenues and ta instruments. sales in the rest of the americas had double-digit sales growth for instrument systems and double-digit sales growth for pharmaceutical customers, which was offset by a decline in sales to industrial customers.

in 2019, sales to pharmaceutical customers were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 2%, as well as a slower release of capital budgets by our customers due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions due to brexit and regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets in china. offsetting those declines was an increase in the need for global access to prescription drugs and the testing of newer and complex biologic drugs. the decline in sales to industrial customers in 2019 was due to weaker demand for our lc-ms instruments and also a 4% decline in ta sales. the increase in sales to academic and governmental customers was primarily due to higher instrument system sales.

precision chemistry consumables sales increased in both 2019 and 2018, driven by sales in the u.s. and china, primarily to pharmaceutical customers, on the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits. waters service sales in both 2019 and 2018 benefited from increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. waters instrument system sales (lc and ms technology-based) decreased in 2019 in most major geographical regions, primarily due to lower sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions relating to brexit and other regulatory changes in certain regions. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased waters sales by 2% in 2019 and had a minimal impact on waters sales in 2018.
in 2019, waters sales increased 2% in asia, were flat in the americas and decreased 3% in europe, where the effect of foreign currency decreased sales by 4%. within asia, waters sales decreased 1% in china and increased 4% in japan and 9% in the rest of asia, excluding india.

ta's instrument system sales declined in 2019 primarily due to lower customer demand resulting from macroeconomic conditions, tariff posturing and political instability, while 2018 instrument system sales growth was broad-based across all product classes. ta service sales increased due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. the effect of foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on ta's sales in both 2019 and 2018.
in 2019, ta sales decreased 4% in the americas, 12% in europe and increased 1% in asia. ta sales in the u.s. increased 9% in 2018, while sales in the rest of the americas increased 8%. ta's sales in asia were driven by double-digit sales growth in india and 8% sales growth in china, which was offset by declines in japan.
cost of sales cost of sales for 2019 increased 2% as compared to 2018, due to a change in sales mix. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased cost of sales by 1% in 2019 primarily from the favorable foreign currency translation effect the british pound had on the company's u.k. manufacturing operations.
cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. at current foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may decrease sales and gross profit during 2020.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were flat in 2019 and decreased 1% in 2018. in 2019, selling and administrative expenses were impacted by merit compensation costs that were offset by lower variable incentive compensation costs. in addition, 2019 was also impacted by the $10 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in january of 2019. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 1% in 2019 and had a minimal impact in 2018.
as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.2%, 22.2% and 23.6% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
31
research and development expenses research and development expenses were flat in 2019 and increased 8% in 2018. research and development expenses in both 2019 and 2018 were impacted by additional headcount, merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. foreign currency translation decreased research and development costs by 2% in 2019 and had a minimal impact on research and development costs in 2018.
acquired in-process research and development during 2017, the company incurred charges of $5 million for acquired in-process research and development related to milestone payments associated with a licensing arrangement for certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. these licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the company to make additional future payments of up to $7 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales. these future payments may be significant and occur over multiple years.
interest expense, net the increase in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, being somewhat offset by the additional interest income from the u.s.-to-euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements.
provision for income taxes the company's effective tax rates were 12.7%, 13.0% and 96.8% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the company's effective income tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate each year due to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates and the items discussed below.
the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the u.s., ireland, the u.k. and singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of december 31, 2019. the company has a received a tax holiday on qualifying activities in singapore through march 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the company expects to continue to meet. the effect of applying the 0% contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company's net income during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 by $24 million, $28 million and $25 million, respectively, and increased the company's net income per diluted share by $0.35, $0.36 and $0.31, respectively.
during 2019, the company's effective tax rate differed from the 21% u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, an $11 million provision related to the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") tax and a tax benefit of $9 million on stock-based compensation.
the 2018 effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, a $14 million provision related to the gilti tax, an $8 million provision for a change in foreign currency exchange rates related to the transition tax, a $9 million benefit related to stock-based compensation and a $6 million net benefit related to the finalization of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 act").
the 2017 effective tax rate of 96.8% differs from the 35% u.s. statutory tax rate primarily due to the 2017 act and the jurisdictional mix of earnings. as a result of the 2017 act, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company accrued a $550 million tax provision, which consisted of $490 million related to the federal transition tax, $40 million for state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes and $20 million for the revaluation of the
32
company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal tax rate of 21%. this provision reduced net income per diluted share by $6.82 in 2017, and the company's effective tax rate was 11.0% excluding this $550 million provision. during 2017, the company also had a benefit of $20 million related to stock-based compensation. the remaining differences between effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.
prior to the enactment of the 2017 act, the company had indefinite reinvestment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. at the end of 2018, and as a result of the enactment of the 2017 act, we reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer considered these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. the company recorded a tax provision of $3 million and $4 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, for future withholding taxes and u.s. state taxes on repatriation of 2019 and 2018 undistributed earnings.
the company's effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. as a result of variability in these factors, the company's effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years, or for previously forecasted periods.

cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $643 million, $604 million and $698 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income:
•   the changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. days sales outstanding was 77 days at december 31, 2019, 74 days at december 31, 2018 and 71 days at 2017.

33
•   the changes in inventory were primarily attributable to new product launches and the increase in safety stock in advance of brexit.

•   the changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were the result of timing of payments to vendors. in addition, the change in 2019 as compared to 2018 includes $29 million and $103 million, respectively, of income tax payments made in the u.s. relating to the company's estimated 2017 tax reform liability and 2018 estimated income tax payments and a $15 million litigation settlement payment.

•   net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts.

•   other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets, other liabilities, and income tax expenses related to the 2017 tax act. in addition, in 2018, the company made $11 million of contributions to certain defined benefit pension plans.

during 2018 and 2017, the company purchased $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion of investments, respectively. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, $1.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion of investments matured, respectively. the majority of the proceeds received in 2019 and 2018 were repatriated into the u.s. at lower income tax rates as a result of the 2017 tax act and used to reduce the company's debt and to repurchase shares.
asset and business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $31 million during 2018. there were no business acquisitions in 2019 or 2017. during 2019 and 2018, the company made $9 million and $8 million of investments in unaffiliated companies, respectively. during 2017, the company made a $7 million payment for an investment in a developer of analytical system solutions used to make measurements, predict stability and accelerate product discovery in the routine analytic, process monitoring and quality control release processes for life science and biopharmaceutical markets. also during 2017, the company made payments of $5 million to acquire and license intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized.
in january 2020, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire andrew alliance, an innovator in specialty laboratory automation technology, including software and robotics for approximately $80 million in cash. this acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on the company's sales and expenses in 2020.
cash used in financing activities in september 2019, the company issued fixed interest rate senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principle of $500 million, of which $200 million of the outstanding notes matures in seven years and the remaining $300 million matures in 10 years. the company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.

interest on the company's fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. the company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for series h and j senior unsecured notes. in the event of a change in control of the company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. these senior unsecured notes require that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default.
the company's net debt borrowings increased by $535 million in 2019, decreased by $850 million in 2018 and increased by $170 million in 2017. as of december 31, 2019, the company had a total of $1.7 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.1 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan and $325 million borrowed under a revolving credit facility, with both the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the 2017 credit agreement. as of december 31, 2019, the company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 credit agreement of $1,173 million after outstanding letters of credit. as of december 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
as of december 31, 2019, the company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated net asset investments. as a result of entering into these agreements, the company lowered its net interest expense by $12 million and $3 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. the company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $15 million annually in 2020, $11 million in 2021 and $1 million in 2022 as the three-year term of the agreements expire.
in january 2019, the company's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company repurchased 11.1 million, 6.8 million and 1.8 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock at a cost of $2.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $323 million, respectively, under the january 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. in addition, the company repurchased $8 million, $10 million and $10 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the company received $54 million, $52 million and $98 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the company's employee stock purchase plan in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
35
the company had cash and cash equivalents of $337 million as of december 31, 2019. the majority of the company's cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $249 million held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2019, of which $176 million was held in currencies other than u.s. dollars. the company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the u.s. these cash requirements are managed by the company's cash flow from operations, its existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of the company's revolving credit facility.
management believes, as of the date of this report, that the company's financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. prior to the enactment of the 2017 act, the company had an indefinite reinvestment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. at the end of 2018, and as a result of the enactment of the 2017 act, we reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer considered these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.

(2)   the interest rates applicable to the 2017 credit agreement are, at the company's option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal reserve bank of new york rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (c) the adjusted libo rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in u.s. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted libo rate or euribo rate for euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the company's leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for libo rate or euribo rate loans. the facility fee on the 2017 credit agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. the 2017 credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, the 2017 credit agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. as of december 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all such covenants.

from time to time, the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. the company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the company's financial position or results of operations.
the company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company and whether the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. during fiscal year 2020, the company expects to contribute approximately $3 million to $6 million to the company's defined benefit plans.
the company has contingent consideration for an earnout pertaining to its july 2014 acquisition of the net assets of medimass research, development and service kft. ("medimass"). the earnout payments are not included above since they are dependent upon many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of december 31, 2019 is $3 million.
the company licenses certain technology and software from third parties. future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of december 31, 2019 are immaterial. the company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the company could make additional future payments of up to $7 million, as well as royalties on future net sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. as a result, these potential payments are not included in the table above.
the company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the company's ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company.
the company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. pursuant to these agreements, the company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the company's business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the company or its subcontractors. the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. historically, the company's costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.
37
critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company's financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the company's results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its policies and estimates. the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. there are other items within the company's consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition the company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1, 2018 and applied the modified-retrospective method. the company elected the practical expedient and only evaluated the contracts that were considered incomplete as of january 1, 2018 when quantifying the cumulative effect adjustment under the modified retrospective method. ultimately, the company determined that there was not a significant change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for the company's products and services. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and, as such, did not require any adjustments to information reported in the prior year. the revenue recognition policies described below were effective as of january 1, 2018.
the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. the company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts.
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. in substantially all of the company's arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. in more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. all incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. in situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the company's obligation to ship the products to its customers, the company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. in more rare situations, the company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. the company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the company from a customer.
generally, the company's contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. the company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is
38
recognized separately upon the completion of installation. the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. the company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. in developing these estimates, the company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors.
the company has sales from standalone software, which are included in instrument systems revenue. these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the company has determined are distinct performance obligations. the company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the company's performance in satisfying this obligation. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
payment terms and conditions vary among the company's revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of their credit risk is performed. returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products.
service revenue includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and (ii) service calls (time and materials). instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. the amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the company's performance in satisfying this obligation. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
the company's deferred revenue liabilities at december 31, 2019 was $214 million on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. the company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. the company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. historically, the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. the company's accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2019 was $588 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $10 million.
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out  basis ("fifo"). the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence,
39
historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the company's current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. the company's inventory balance at december 31, 2019 was recorded at its net realizable value of $321 million, which is net of write-downs of $26 million.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software and patent costs;

•   significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

•   significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company's capitalized patents, purchased technology, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written-down to its estimated fair value. net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $240 million, $417 million and $356 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2019.
the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on december 31 of each year. for goodwill impairment review purposes, the company has two reporting units: waters and ta. the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future as the fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   significant decline in the company's projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

•   significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

•   significant decline in the company's stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

•   adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

•   unanticipated competition.

income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. this process involves the company estimating its income taxes, taking into account the amount, timing and character of taxable income, tax deductions and credits and assessing changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties. differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. in the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods, such changes could materially impact the company's financial position and results of operations.
40
the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods.
uncertain tax positions the company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. the company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. at december 31, 2019, the company had unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of $28 million.
the company has been granted a 0% contractual tax rate in singapore that requires the achievement of certain operational and financial milestones that the company expects to meet, to the extent not already achieved, by december 31, 2020 and maintain through at least march 31, 2021. as part of the company's determination of uncertain tax positions, the company regularly assesses its progress against these operational and financial milestone targets to determine whether the milestones can be reasonably achieved. these milestones were negotiated with the singaporean tax authorities and established based on the company's historical financial performance; the anticipated customer end-market demand, particularly in certain regions in the world, and the company's anticipated future operating plans. these assessments require significant judgments and estimates about the company's ability to meet the milestone targets for the following types of objectives: reaching and maintaining annual revenue and business spending targets; meeting capital expenditures targets; attaining and sustaining employment targets; and establishing a local research and development and service center. the company regularly monitors its actual and forecasted sales and operating results against these milestones and the company makes the determination as to whether the future forecasted financial results are most likely to be achieved. these milestones are very similar in nature to the previous singaporean tax holiday contractual agreements that the company successfully completed. these milestones are not required to be met until december 2020, at the earliest, which gives the company sufficient time to make any necessary adjustments to its operating plans to achieve the milestones.
currently, the company has determined that it is more likely than not to realize the contractual tax rate in singapore of 0% and has not recognized an uncertain tax position in its balance sheet related to the achievement of the contractual milestones in singapore. however, these milestones can be significantly influenced by the business climate in singapore and the company's overall financial performance and, in the event that the company determines that the milestone targets are not expected to be met, the company would no longer be able to record a tax benefit at a 0% contractual tax rate on income earned in singapore from and after the april 1, 2016 start date of the contract period. at such time, the company would record an income tax charge on the affected singapore income earned back to april 1, 2016 at the singapore statutory tax rate(s) (currently 17%), with a corresponding income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet. for the year ended 2019, the effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in singapore increased the company's net income and net income per diluted share by $24 million and $0.35, respectively.
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company's previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. at december 31, 2019, the company's warranty liability was $12 million.
41
litigation as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings, of this form 10-k, the company is a party to various pending litigation matters. with respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. if and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty.
pension and other retirement benefits in 2018, the company settled its defined benefit pension plan in the u.s. as a result of this settlement, the company's defined benefit pension obligations were significantly reduced in 2018 and 2019. the company still maintains a number of smaller defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits throughout the world. assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company's remaining less significant pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. the company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 6.25% for its u.s. benefit plans and 3.11% for its non-u.s. benefit plans.
at the end of each year, the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. the company utilized milliman's bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its u.s. benefit plans. the company determined the discount rate for its non-u.s.  benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31, 2019 that best matched the timing of the plan's future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. once the interest rates were determined, the plan's cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. at december 31, 2019, the company determined the weighted-average discount rate to be 3.42% for the u.s. benefit plans and 1.38% for the non-u.s. benefits plans.
a one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return would decrease the company's net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million. a one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company's net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million.
stock-based compensation the accounting standards for stock-based compensation require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. the company has used the black-scholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards and performance stock unit awards, respectively. under the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the company's results of operations could be materially impacted. as stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards, the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period. the company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method.

business combinations and asset acquisitions the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. the results of each acquisition are included in the company's consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. acquired in-process research and development ("ipr&d") included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired ipr&d is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs. upon commercialization, this indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, subject to periodic impairment reviews. if the research and development project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements. these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments, contingent upon certain future events. ipr&d acquired in an asset acquisition (as opposed to a business combination) is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use. subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed. payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.

item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview northern trust corporation (the corporation) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. the corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: corporate & institutional services (c&is) and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to c&is and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business.
the corporation conducts business through various u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries, including the northern trust company (the bank). the corporation was formed as a holding company for the bank in 1971. the corporation has a global presence with offices in 21 u.s. states and washington, d.c., and across 22 locations in canada, europe, the middle east and the asia-pacific region. except where the context requires otherwise, the terms "northern trust," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms refers to the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
financial overview net income decreased $64.2 million, or 4%, to $1.49 billion in 2019 from $1.56 billion in 2018. earnings per diluted common share was $6.63 in 2019 compared to $6.64 in 2018. return on average common equity decreased to 14.9% in 2019 from 16.2% in 2018.
revenue increased $112.8 million, or 2%, to $6.07 billion in 2019 from $5.96 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees of 3%, an increase in net interest income of 3%, and an increase in other operating income of 14%, partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange trading income of 18%.
client assets under custody/administration (auc/a) increased 19% from $10.13 trillion as of december 31, 2018 to $12.05 trillion as of december 31, 2019. client assets under custody, a component of auc/a, increased 22% from $7.59 trillion as of december 31, 2018 to $9.23 trillion as of december 31, 2019. client assets under custody included $5.89 trillion of global custody assets as of december 31, 2019, which increased 25% from $4.70 trillion as of december 31, 2018. client assets under management increased 15% to $1.23 trillion as of december 31, 2019 from $1.07 trillion at december 31, 2018.
trust, investment and other servicing fees, which represent the largest component of total revenue, increased 3% to $3.85 billion in 2019, from $3.75 billion in 2018, primarily due to new business and favorable markets, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower securities lending revenue.
foreign exchange trading income of $250.9 million in 2019 decreased 18% from $307.2 million in 2018, primarily resulting from lower foreign exchange swap activity in treasury.
other operating income of $145.5 million in 2019 increased 14% from $127.5 million in 2018, primarily due to income related to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented during 2019, higher miscellaneous income, and the prior-year impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, partially offset by a charge related to the decision made in 2019 to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio.
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (fte) basis of $1.71 billion in 2019, increased $46.8 million, or 3%, from $1.66 billion in 2018, due to an increased net interest margin, partially offset by lower levels of average earning assets. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.60% in 2019 from 1.46% in 2018, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap activity.
the provision for credit losses in each of 2019 and 2018 was a credit provision of $14.5 million. the current-year credit provision reflected a decrease in the inherent reserve related to the residential real estate portfolio due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality and reductions to the specific reserve related to the commercial and institutional and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality. the prior-year credit provision primarily reflected reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. this was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio. loans and leases of $31.4 billion as of december 31, 2019 decreased from $32.5 billion as of december 31, 2018. net recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2019 were $0.7 million, compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. nonperforming assets decreased to $86.8 million as of december 31, 2019 from $117.7 million as of december 31, 2018.
noninterest expense of $4.14 billion in 2019 increased $126.6 million, or 3%, from $4.02 billion in 2018, primarily reflecting increased compensation, outside services, equipment and software expense, and occupancy expense.
32 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes in 2019 totaled $451.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.2%. the provision for income taxes in 2018 totaled $401.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 20.5%. the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to higher u.s. taxes payable on the income of the corporation's non-u.s. branches in 2019 as well as income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software development-related expenses and the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.
northern trust continued to maintain a strong capital position during 2019, with all capital ratios exceeding those required for classification as "well-capitalized" under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. total stockholders' equity increased 6% from $10.5 billion in 2018 to $11.1 billion at year-end. during 2019, the corporation issued and sold 16 million depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock for proceeds of $391.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other issuance costs. these proceeds were subsequently used to fund the redemption of all outstanding shares of the corporation's series c non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on january 2, 2020.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, northern trust increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.70 per share and repurchased 11.8 million shares of common stock, returning $1.7 billion in capital to common stockholders, compared to $1.4 billion during the year ended december 31, 2018.

revenue northern trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.
revenue in 2019 of $6.07 billion increased 2% from $5.96 billion in 2018. noninterest income represented 72% and 73% of total revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and totaled $4.40 billion in 2019, which increased 1% from $4.34 billion in 2018.
noninterest income in 2019 increased primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and other operating income, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income. trust, investment and other servicing fees of $3.85 billion in 2019 increased $98.5 million, or 3%, from $3.75 billion in 2018, primarily due to new business and favorable markets, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower securities lending revenue. foreign exchange trading income in 2019 of $250.9 million decreased $56.3 million, or 18%, compared with $307.2 million in 2018, primarily resulting from lower foreign exchange swap activity in treasury. other operating income of $145.5 million in 2019 increased 14% from $127.5 million in the prior year, primarily due to income related to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented during 2019, higher miscellaneous income, and the prior-year impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, partially offset by a charge related to the decision made in 2019 to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio.
net interest income on an fte basis in 2019 of $1.71 billion increased $46.8 million, or 3%, from $1.66 billion in 2018, due to an increased net interest margin, partially offset by lower levels of average earning assets. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.60% in 2019 from 1.46% in 2018, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap activity. average earning assets decreased $6.6 billion, or 6%, from $113.7 billion in 2018 to $107.1 billion in 2019, primarily reflecting lower levels of short-term interest bearing deposits and loans and leases.

foreign exchange trading income northern trust provides foreign exchange services in the normal course of business as an integral part of its global custody services. active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. foreign exchange trading income in 2019 of $250.9 million decreased $56.3 million, or 18%, compared with $307.2 million in 2018, primarily resulting from lower foreign exchange swap activity in treasury.
treasury management fees treasury management fees, generated from cash and treasury management products and services provided to clients, of $44.5 million in 2019 decreased 14%, or $7.3 million, from $51.8 million in 2018, primarily due to an increase in the earnings credit rate applied to client balances and lower transaction based volumes.
security commissions and trading income security commissions and trading income is generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by northern trust securities, inc., and totaled $103.6 million in 2019, which increased 5%, or $5.3 million, from $98.3 million in 2018, primarily due to higher revenue from interest rate swaps and core brokerage, partially offset by lower transition management revenue.

other income of $51.9 million in 2019 increased $19.7 million or 60%, from $32.2 million in 2018, primarily due to income related to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented during 2019, higher miscellaneous income, and the prior-year impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, partially offset by a charge related to the decision made in 2019 to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio.
investment security losses, net net investment security losses totaled $1.4 million and $1.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. losses in 2019 and 2018 include $0.3 million and $0.5 million of charges related to the other-than-temporary impairment (otti) of certain community reinvestment act (cra) eligible held-to-maturity securities, respectively.
net interest income net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. earning assets - including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal reserve and other central bank deposits and other, securities, and loans and leases - are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, and stockholders' equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. in addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.
net interest income stated on an fte basis is a non-gaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. when adjusted to an fte basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income. a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided on page 89.

net interest income in 2019 of $1.68 billion increased $55.2 million, or 3%, from $1.62 billion in 2018. net interest income on an fte basis for 2019 was $1.71 billion, which increased $46.8 million, or 3%, from $1.66 billion in 2018, due to an increased net interest margin, partially offset by lower levels of average earning assets. average earning assets decreased $6.6 billion, or 6%, to $107.1 billion in 2019 from $113.7 billion in 2018. the net interest margin in 2019 was 1.57%, which increased from 1.43% in 2018. the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2019 was 1.60%, which increased from 1.46% in 2018.
average earning assets decreased primarily reflecting lower levels of short-term interest bearing deposits and loans and leases. federal reserve and other central bank deposits and other averaged $18.5 billion in 2019, which decreased $5.4 billion, or 22%, from $23.9 billion in 2018. interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged $6.0 billion in each of 2019 and 2018. loans and leases averaged $31.1 billion, which decreased $975.8 million, or 3%, from $32.0 billion in 2018. securities, inclusive of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock and certain community development investments which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, averaged $50.7 billion, which increased $402.9 million, or 1%, from $50.3 billion in 2018.
funding of the balance sheet reflected lower levels of non-u.s. interest-bearing deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increases in u.s. interest-bearing deposits. average interest-bearing deposits decreased $2.3 billion, or 3%, to $72.3 billion in 2019 from $74.6 billion in 2018. average demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $3.0 billion, or 15%, to $17.5 billion in 2019 from $20.5 billion in 2018.
stockholders' equity averaged $10.6 billion in 2019, compared with $10.2 billion in 2018. the increased stockholders' equity of $419.5 million, or 4%, was primarily attributable to current-year earnings, the issuance of preferred stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income since the prior-year period, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program and dividend declarations. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 27% to $0.70 per share and repurchased 11.8 million shares, returning $1.7 billion in capital to common stockholders, compared to $1.4 billion in 2018.
under the corporation's 2019 capital plan, which was reviewed without objection by the federal reserve, the corporation may repurchase up to $828.5 million of common stock after december 31, 2019, through june 30, 2020.
40 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit provision of $14.5 million in each of 2019 and 2018. the current-year credit provision primarily reflected a decrease in the inherent reserve related to the residential real estate portfolio due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality and reductions to the specific reserve related to the commercial and institutional and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality. the prior-year credit provision primarily reflected reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. this was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio.
nonperforming assets at december 31, 2019 decreased 26% from the prior year-end. residential real estate, commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, private client, and non-u.s. loans accounted for 85%, 9%, 4%, 1%, and 1% respectively, of nonperforming loans and leases at december 31, 2019. for further discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses, refer to the "asset quality" section.
noninterest expense noninterest expense for 2019 of $4.14 billion increased $126.6 million, or 3%, from $4.02 billion in 2018, primarily reflecting increased compensation, outside services, equipment and software expense, and occupancy expense.

compensation compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, of $1.86 billion in 2019 increased $52.1 million, or 3%, compared to $1.81 billion in 2018, primarily reflecting higher salary expense driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by lower incentive expense. staff on a full-time equivalent basis totaled approximately 19,800 at december 31, 2019, up 5% from approximately 18,800 at december 31, 2018.
employee benefits employee benefits expense of $355.2 million in 2019 decreased slightly from $356.7 million in 2018, primarily reflecting lower retirement plan and medical expenses, partially offset by higher payroll taxes.
outside services outside services expense of $774.5 million in 2019 increased $35.1 million, or 5%, from $739.4 million in 2018, primarily due to higher technical services costs as well as consulting and legal services, partially offset by lower sub-custodian expenses.
equipment and software equipment and software expense of $612.1 million in 2019 increased $29.9 million, or 5%, compared to $582.2 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher software support costs, software disposition, depreciation and amortization, and maintenance costs.
occupancy occupancy expense of $212.9 million in 2019 increased $11.8 million, or 6%, from $201.1 million in 2018, primarily due to higher rent and building operating costs associated with executing workplace real estate strategies.

provision for income taxes provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pre-tax income as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws. the 2019 provision for income taxes was $451.9 million, representing an effective rate of 23.2%. this compares with a provision for income taxes of $401.4 million and an effective rate of 20.5% in 2018.
the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to higher u.s. taxes payable on the income of the corporation's non-u.s. branches in 2019 as well as income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software development-related expenses and the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.
the tcja was enacted on december 22, 2017, and reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. it also required companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. at december 31, 2017, northern trust made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the tcja. during 2018, northern trust completed the related calculations and additional analyses associated with the implementation of the tcja, resulting in a number of adjustments to the 2018 tax provision as follows:

impact related to federal deferred taxes              12.7          (210.0   )
other adjustments                                     (0.7   )         6.9
provision (benefit) for income taxes                 $(4.8   )      $(53.1   )
adjustments in the above table included a tax benefit of $16.8 million resulting from an adjustment to the corporation's 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, offset by a $12.7 million net provision recorded associated with the repricing of deferred taxes.
as a result of the tcja, earnings which had been reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states were deemed to have been repatriated to the united states and were subject to a repatriation tax. as of december 31, 2018, northern trust's repatriation tax was $133.2 million.

reporting segments and related information the following information summarizes our results of operations by reporting segment for 2019 compared to 2018. for a discussion related to the results of operations by reporting segment for 2018 compared to 2017, refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2018 form 10-k, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on february 26, 2019.
42 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations northern trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: c&is and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to c&is and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business. the revenue and expenses of asset management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to c&is and wealth management.
reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (ftp) methodology. under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. northern trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.
effective january 1, 2019, northern trust implemented several enhancements to its ftp methodology, including the allocation of contingent liquidity charges to c&is and wealth management client instruments and products. these methodology enhancements affect the results of each reporting segment. due to the lack of historical information, segment results for periods ended prior to january 1, 2019 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements.
also effective january 1, 2019, all revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to c&is and wealth management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment.
for reporting periods ended prior to january 1, 2019, income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios of the corporation and the bank, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive-level compensation and nonrecurring items, were not allocated to c&is and wealth management, and were reported in treasury and other.
reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. the results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. the following table reflects the earnings and average assets for the corporation.

c&is net income decreased 21% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income.
c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees c&is trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. the fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period.
securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. the other services fee category in c&is includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.

46 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash and other assets deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities borrowed from custody clients are managed by northern trust and are included in assets under custody and under management. this securities lending collateral totaled $163.0 billion and $149.8 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
c&is foreign exchange trading income foreign exchange trading income of $232.2 million in 2019, decreased $1.2 million, or 1%, from $233.4 million in 2018, primarily due to lower foreign exchange swap activity in treasury, partially offset by the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning january 1, 2019.
c&is other noninterest income other noninterest income for 2019 of $178.2 million decreased $4.8 million, or 3%, from $183.0 million in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in other operating income and treasury management fees, partially offset by the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning january 1, 2019.
c&is net interest income net interest income on an fte basis, inclusive of the ftp methodology enhancements described above, decreased $73.5 million, or 7%, in 2019 to $918.7 million from $992.2 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher charges due to the ftp methodology enhancements and a decrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. net interest margin on an fte basis decreased to 1.26% from 1.29%. average earning assets of $79.1 billion, increased $2.2 billion, or 3%, from $76.9 billion in the prior year. the earning assets in c&is consisted primarily of intercompany assets and loans and leases. funding sources were primarily comprised of non-u.s. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $54.9 billion in 2019, increased from $54.2 billion in 2018.
c&is provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a provision of $1.9 million for both 2019 and 2018. the 2019 provision reflected an increase to the inherent reserve for outstanding loans due to lower credit quality, partially offset by a decrease to the specific reserve related to standby letters of credit and outstanding loans. the 2018 provision reflected increases to the specific reserve related to standby letters of credit, partially offset by reductions in standby letters of credit and undrawn loan commitments and improved credit quality resulting in a reduction of the inherent allowance.
c&is noninterest expense total c&is noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, of $2.61 billion in 2019, increased $184.1 million, or 8%, from $2.42 billion in 2018. the increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations, including those due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning january 1, 2019, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by lower other operating expenses.

wealth management net interest income net interest income on an fte basis, inclusive of the ftp methodology enhancements described above, of $792.0 million for 2019 decreased $24.5 million, or 3%, from $816.5 million in 2018, primarily attributable to a decrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in earning assets. net interest margin on an fte basis decreased to 3.06% from 3.16%, reflecting lower yields on earning assets. average earning assets of $28.0 billion in 2019, increased $2.1 billion, or 8%, in the current year from $25.9 billion in 2018.
wealth management provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was a credit provision of $16.4 million in both 2019 and 2018. the 2019 credit provision was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, which resulted in a reduction of the inherent allowance. the 2018 credit provision was primarily driven by improved credit quality and reductions in outstanding loans, standby letters of credit, and undrawn commitments, which resulted in a reduction of the inherent allowance.

residential real estate the residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients. residential real estate loans totaled $6.0 billion at december 31, 2019, or 20% of total u.s. loans and leases, compared with $6.5 billion, or 22% of total u.s. loans and leases, at december 31, 2018. all residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing northern trust's credit policies, which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial "teaser" rates, and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 80% at inception. appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties.
of the total $6.0 billion in residential real estate loans at december 31, 2019, $1.6 billion were in florida, $1.2 billion were in california, and $1.0 billion were in the greater chicago area, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the united states served by northern trust. legally binding undrawn commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled $714.2 million and $824.0 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
commercial real estate in managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower's principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. the commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to northern trust. underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required.
commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. these loans are primarily located in the california, illinois, florida, texas, and arizona markets. construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. the intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with northern trust or another financial institution upon completion.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nonperforming assets of $86.8 million as of december 31, 2019 decreased $30.9 million, or 26% from $117.7 million at december 31, 2018, reflecting decreases in the residential real estate portfolio driven by payoffs and payments, partially offset by new nonperforming assets. changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component).
the sec requires the disclosure of the allowance for credit losses that is applicable to international operations. the disclosure has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining non-u.s. operating performance. the amounts disclosed should not be construed as being the only amounts that are available for non-u.s. loan charge-offs, since the entire allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both u.s. and non-u.s. loans. in addition, these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future charge-off trends. there was no allowance for credit losses relating to non-u.s. operations for years 2016 through 2019. for 2015, there was a $3.3 million allowance for credit losses at the beginning of the year, a credit provision of $3.3 million during the year, and no allowance for credit losses as of december 31, 2015.
the following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at december 31, 2019, and at each of the prior four year-ends.

60 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations specific component of the allowance: the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay.
the specific allowance component decreased $3.1 million from $10.0 million at december 31, 2018 to $6.9 million at december 31, 2019, primarily attributable to standby letters of credit and outstanding loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio and outstanding loans in the residential real estate portfolios.
inherent component of the allowance: the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans.
the inherent portion of the allowance decreased $10.7 million to $117.5 million at december 31, 2019, compared with $128.2 million at december 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality within the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality.
overall allowance: the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of $124.4 million at december 31, 2019, compared with $138.2 million at the end of 2018. the allowance of $104.5 million assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was 0.33% at december 31, 2019, which decreased from a $112.6 million allowance assigned to loans and leases, representing 0.35% of total loans and leases at december 31, 2018. allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $19.9 million and $25.6 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
provision: the provision for credit losses was a credit provision of $14.5 million and net recoveries totaled $0.7 million in 2019. this compares with a credit provision of $14.5 million and net charge-offs of $1.1 million in 2018.
impaired loans a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor's financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. as of december 31, 2019, impaired loans totaled $92.2 million and included $82.6 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of $116.2 million at december 31, 2018, which included $99.8 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. impaired loans had $5.0 million and $7.2 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. impaired loans are measured based upon the loan's market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of december 31, 2019) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards.
capital expenditures capital expenditures in 2019 included continued investments to enhance northern trust's software and hardware capabilities, the opening of new offices, and the expansion and renovation of several existing offices. capital expenditures for 2019 totaled $599.8 million, of which $441.8 million was for software, $73.7 million was for computer hardware, $77.7 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $6.6 million was for furnishings. these capital expenditures principally support, enhance, and protect northern trust's investment management, asset servicing and asset management systems and capabilities, and deliver innovative solutions to better serve our clients. additional capital expenditures committed for technology systems will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. software amortization and depreciation on computer hardware and machinery are charged to equipment and software expense. depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to occupancy expense and equipment expense, respectively. capital expenditures for 2018 totaled $506.0 million, of which $408.4 million was for software, $62.0 million was for computer hardware, $29.9 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $5.7 million was for furnishings.

geographic area information northern trust's non-u.s. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both u.s and non-u.s. source assets. non-u.s. source assets are not separately identified in northern trust's internal management reporting system. however, northern trust is required to disclose non-u.s. activities based on the domicile of the customer. due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trust's activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision assets between u.s. and non-u.s.-domiciled customers. therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between u.s. and non-u.s. operations.
the following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to non-u.s. operations (based on the obligor's domicile) and the percent of those balances to total consolidated average assets. see also note 33, "reporting segments and related information," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

non-u.s. outstandings as used in this discussion and the following table, non-u.s. outstandings are cross-border outstandings as defined by the sec. they consist of loans, securities, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, accrued interest and other monetary assets. not included are letters of credit, loan commitments, and non-u.s. office local currency claims on residents. non-u.s. outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible, liquid collateral realizable outside the country. however, transactions with branches of non-u.s. banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the non-u.s. bank's head office.
short-term interbank time deposits with non-u.s. banks represent the largest category of non-u.s. outstandings. northern trust actively participates in the interbank market with u.s. and non-u.s. banks.
northern trust places deposits with non-u.s. counterparties that have strong internal (northern trust) risk ratings and external credit ratings. these non-u.s. banks are approved and monitored by northern trust's capital markets credit committee, which has credit authority for exposure to all non-u.s. banks and approves credit limits. this process includes financial analysis of the non-u.s. banks, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators. each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions. separate from the entity-specific review process, the average life to maturity of deposits with non-u.s. banks is deliberately maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions. northern trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral and/or balance sheet netting. additionally, the capital market credit committee oversees country-risk analyses and imposes limits to country exposure.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity as the corporation's principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust's banking activities, the bank centrally manages liquidity for all u.s. and international banking operations. liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the c&is and wealth management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, federal home loan bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2019, the bank had over $38.0 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. the bank also is active in the u.s. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit. northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 69% of total assets as of december 31, 2019. the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank, which include those placed at the federal reserve discount window, totaled $46.7 billion at december 31, 2019. the corporation and the bank each satisfied the u.s. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2019.
the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank. the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the bank, and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. on may 3, 2019, the corporation issued $500 million of 3.15% senior notes, due may 3, 2029. the corporation also received $2.0 billion of dividends from the bank in 2019. dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in note 32, "restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
the corporation's uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation's stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2019 were $1.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $529.7 million of common stock dividends.
the corporation's liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $2.6 billion and $866.8 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. during, and at year-end, 2019 and 2018, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. average liquidity during 2019 and 2018 was $1.96 billion and $887.0 million, respectively. the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 35, "northern trust corporation (corporation only)," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

statements of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion, primarily reflecting period earnings and lower net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties.
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, was $1.8 billion, primarily reflecting period earnings and the impact of other operating activities and non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties.
net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily reflecting higher levels of deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks, net purchases of debt securities available for sale, and the purchase of bank-owned life insurance policies in 2019, partially offset by the net proceeds from the maturity and redemption of debt securities held to maturity and lower levels of loans and leases.
net cash provided by investing activities was $4.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily reflecting decreased levels of deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks and lower interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by net purchases of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity and the net change in other investing activities.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $0.6 billion, primarily reflecting higher levels of total deposits, proceeds from the issuance by the corporation of 3.15% senior notes, and proceeds from the series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuance, partially offset by lower federal funds purchased, lower short-term other borrowings, and the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program. the increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to higher levels of domestic interest-bearing client deposits and non-u.s. office noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower levels of non-u.s. interest-bearing deposits.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities totaled $5.8 billion, primarily reflecting decreased levels of total deposits, the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporation's share repurchase program,

standby letters of credit obligate northern trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. these instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. northern trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. standby letters of credit and financial guarantees of $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, include $44.5 million and $72.3 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others.
financial guarantees are issued by northern trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under certain arrangements.
commercial letters of credit are instruments issued by northern trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement and other similar instruments. commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.
as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, northern trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the northern trust capital markets credit committee. in connection with these activities, northern trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower's failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral
70 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations required to be posted. borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. as securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. the collateral is revalued on a daily basis. the amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was $138.1 billion and $128.9 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at december 31, 2019, or 2018 related to these indemnifications.
additional information about northern trust's off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in note 29, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments" to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
variable interest entities variable interest entities (vies) are defined within gaap as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vie's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie.
leveraged leases. in leveraged leasing transactions, northern trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds 20-30% of the asset's cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining -80% provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. in such transactions, the trusts, which are vies, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. the lessee's maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. as a result, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the leveraged lease trust vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the leveraged lease trust vies.
tax credit structures. northern trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. the community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which northern trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. the economic performance of the community development projects, some of which are vies, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development project vies as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the community development project vies.
investment funds. northern trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of northern trust are investors. as an asset manager of funds, northern trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund's investment objective. based on its analysis, northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies under gaap.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates. the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust's future financial condition and results of operations.
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for northern trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors (audit committee).
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. the loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. in determining an appropriate allowance level, northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures.
the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:
specific allowance: the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay. for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management's judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.
inherent allowance: the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments based on loan type, loan size, and borrower rating. for each segment, the probability of default over a loss emergence period and a loss given default are derived from the historical data and applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. in determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management, the reporting segments and corporate finance.
the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. in addition to northern trust's own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate.
loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management's assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. the provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs.
management's estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2019 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. however, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
72 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension plan accounting northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees (u.s. qualified plan) and a u.s. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (u.s. non-qualified plan). certain european-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarially-based projections relating to the plans. due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. as a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders' equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.
northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans' actuaries. in addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.
in determining the pension expense for the u.s. pension plans in 2019, northern trust utilized a discount rate of 4.47% for both the u.s. qualified plan and the u.s. non-qualified plan. the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 4.39%. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. qualified plan assets was 6.00%.
in evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the u.s. pension plans as of northern trust's december 31, 2019 measurement date, the following were considered:
•   discount rate: northern trust estimates the discount rate for its u.s. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the aon aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date. this yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aa-rated corporate bonds. this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 3.37% at december 31, 2019 for the u.s. qualified and non-qualified plans, a decrease from 4.47% at december 31, 2018.
•   compensation level: based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 4.97%.
•   rate of return on plan assets: the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. as a result of these analyses, northern trust's rate of return assumption for the u.s. qualified plan decreased from 6.00% for 2019 to 5.25% for 2020.
•   mortality table: as of december 31, 2019, northern trust has adopted the aggregate pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year, which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2019. northern trust's pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale mp-2019, which was also released by the society of actuaries in october 2019. this assumption was updated at december 31, 2019 from improvement scale mp-2018. the updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the mp-2018 improvement scale. mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2020.
net pension expense in 2020 is expected to increase by approximately $30.6 million, primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and expected rate of return.
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 73
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected u.s pension plans' periodic pension expense in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2019, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.

pension contributions: the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a "target liability" under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006. there were no contributions to the u.s. qualified plan for the 2019 plan year. northern trust contributed $50.0 million to the u.s. qualified plan at the beginning of 2018, retrospectively for the 2017 plan year. the minimum required contribution to the u.s. qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2020. the maximum deductible contribution is estimated at $275 million for 2020.
fair value measurements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. as of december 31, 2019, approximately 29% of northern trust's total assets and approximately 1% of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (level 3). approximately 11% of northern trust's assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1. northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.
approximately 89% of northern trust's assets and 99% of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. investment debt securities classified as available for sale make up 97% of level 2 assets with the remaining 3% primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments.
northern trust's level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. northern trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
as of december 31, 2019, all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below, were classified as level 2 and approximately 97%, measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material.
as of december 31, 2019, northern trust's level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 1.1 million and 1.0 million shares of visa inc. class b common stock (visa class b common shares) previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015, respectively. pursuant to the swaps, northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc. class a common stock (visa class a common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion
74 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest. the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trust's own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price. see "visa class b common shares" under note 26, "contingent liabilities," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.
recent accounting pronouncements and developments on january 1, 2020, northern trust adopted asu no. 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments" (asu 2016-13). asu 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. the main provisions of asu 2016-13 include (1) replacing the "incurred loss" approach under current gaap with an "expected loss" model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current gaap, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
in conjunction with the adoption of asu 2016-13, northern trust expects an increase in the allowance for credit losses of less than $20 million. this change in accounting principle will be applied prospectively by increasing the allowance for credit losses on january 1, 2020, with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings, net of income taxes. periods prior to the adoption date will not be adjusted. northern trust also expects that the corporation and the bank's capital ratios will not be materially impacted by the adoption of this standard.
in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-15, "intangibles - goodwill and other - internal - use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force)" (asu 2018-15). asu 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). asu 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted. asu 2018-15 is not expected to have a significant impact on northern trust's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
risk management risk management overview northern trust employs an integrated risk management framework to support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. the framework provides a methodology to identify, assess, monitor, measure, manage and report both internal and external risks to northern trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. northern trust's risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. northern trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.
northern trust's risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. the risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by northern trust. the risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. all identified risks inherent in northern trust's business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk. all material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.
northern trust implements its risk management framework through a "three lines of defense" operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. the model, used to communicate risk management expectations
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 75
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations across the organization, contains three roles, each a complementary level of risk management accountability. within this operating model, northern trust's businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. the risk management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for northern trust's risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. audit services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.
risk governance and oversight overview risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at northern trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. the diagram below provides a high-level overview of northern trust's risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the board of directors and key risk-related committees.

the chief risk officer (cro) oversees northern trust's management of risk and compliance, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. the cro reports directly to the business risk committee and the corporation's chief executive officer. the cro regularly advises the business risk committee and reports to the committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. in accordance with the risk management framework, the cro and the risk management executive leadership team of northern trust, together with the chief financial officer, head of capital and resolution planning, general counsel and chief audit executive, meet as the global enterprise risk committee (gerc) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk and risk themes within northern trust. among other risk management responsibilities, gerc receives reports, escalations, or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. senior risk committees include:
the credit risk committee (crc) establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application.
76 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the operational risk committee (orc) provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the operational risk-related policies and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support coordination of operational risk activities.
the fiduciary risk committee (frc) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities.
the compliance & ethics oversight committee (ceoc) provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the corporation.
the market & liquidity risk committee (mlrc) oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.
the model risk oversight committee (mroc) is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within northern trust.
in addition to the aforementioned committees, northern trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into gerc.
risk assessment, appetite and reporting processes as part of the integrated risk framework, northern trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. northern trust's risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.
northern trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the board of directors and senior management are willing to assume to achieve the corporation's strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with prudent management of risk and applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. it includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks, using both monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to senior management.
risk control risk control is an internal, independent review function within the risk management function. risk control is managed by the head of risk control and is comprised of model risk management, credit review, global compliance testing and basel independent verification groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. model risk management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. credit review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust. global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. lastly, basel independent verification promotes rigor and accuracy in northern trust's ongoing compliance with basel iii requirements and adherence to enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity stress testing. the business risk committee has oversight responsibility with respect to risk control generally as well as each of these groups.
audit services audit services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within northern trust's risk management framework. audit services is managed by the chief audit executive with oversight from the audit committee. audit services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the audit committee. audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. the chief audit executive reports directly to the audit committee and the corporation's chief executive officer and is a non-voting member of gerc.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk overview credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust's activities. a significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. northern trust's loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large u.s. financial institutions in that northern trust is generally:
•   not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;
•   not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and
•   not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging.
credit risk framework and governance the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. to monitor and control credit risk, the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent relationship-based credit culture. this function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, programs, and external regulations.
the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trust's diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust.
the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee. credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee. the capital markets credit committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties.
the crc establishes and monitors credit-related policies and programs throughout northern trust and promotes their uniform application. the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro and chairs the crc. independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control.
credit risk measurement an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust's internal risk rating system. northern trust's internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor's or counterparty's probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity.
the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control.
loans and other extensions of credit a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the "off-balance-sheet arrangements" section and in note 29, "off-balance-sheet financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments" to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
as part of northern trust's credit processes, the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off. northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. independent from the credit risk management function, credit review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management's implementation of the credit risk management's requirements.
counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including over-the-counter (otc) currency and interest rate derivatives, and from indemnified securities lending transactions. credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.
78 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to calculate exposure, northern trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives. the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity.
credit risk mitigation northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. however, northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.
physical and financial collateral: northern trust's primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral. residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.
netting: on-balance-sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting agreements. netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
guarantees: personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trust's claims relative to other creditors. northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.
another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.
operational risk overview operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust's businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or other catastrophes to result in losses. this includes the potential that continuity of service and resiliency may be impacted.
operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the corporation's risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.
operational risk framework and governance to monitor and control operational risk, northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation's operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. the operational risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust. it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk and mitigate northern trust's exposure to loss. several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:
•   loss event data program - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a basel advanced measurement approach (ama) capital quantification.
•   risk and control self-assessment - a structured risk management process used by northern trust's businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls.
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 79
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   operational risk scenario analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses.
•   product and process risk management program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and related significant loss events.
•   outsourcing risk management program - a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing.
•   information security and technology risk management - a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security, including cyber threats and technology risks to the organization.
•   business continuity and disaster recovery management program - a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident.
•   physical security - a program that provides for the safety of northern trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide.
•   insurance management program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events.
as discussed in risk control, model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework.
the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the corporate operational risk policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management's insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks.
operational risk measurement northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable u.s. banking subsidiaries. northern trust's ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data, risk and control self-assessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital. business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.
information security and technology management effective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. northern trust's information security and technology risk management framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and an information security and technology risk management policy and program approved by the business risk committee. the framework is supported by an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the businesses, including the information security and technology risk committee (istrc). the istrc is chaired by the chief information risk officer, who regularly reports to the business risk committee on the status of the information security and technology risk management program.
in addition to a strong governance process, internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trust's overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates. northern trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer-based training, phishing simulations, and the designation of individuals as information security and privacy champions within the businesses. in cases where northern trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.
in addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, northern trust uses external third-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness. these teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of northern trust's susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. northern trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. this center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented cyber incident response plan.
80 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the cyber incident response plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents. a cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity, which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions, denials, compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality, integrity and availably of the assets of northern trust or its clients. the plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions and status to senior management, including the chief information security officer and chief information risk officer, and appropriate stakeholders. the plan is designed to work with enterprise-level response plans, and is reviewed, tested, and updated regularly.
northern trust's disclosure controls and procedures also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents. northern trust also maintains compliance programs to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information, including in instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents.
business resiliency and continuity management northern trust's business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust resumes mission-critical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements.
northern trust's business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.
all of northern trust's businesses are required to risk-assess their critical functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. the strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis. all of northern trust's businesses test their plans at least annually. the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee.
northern trust has also begun exploring the integration of climate-related scenario analyses into its broader risk management program to help align with certain recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures (tcfd). conducting such climate-related scenario analyses and assessing the magnitude of climate-related financial risks and opportunities related to northern trust's global assets are intended to position the organization to navigate uncertain climate futures more effectively.
fiduciary risk fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients' fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document.
fiduciary risk overview the fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization's overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level.
fiduciary risk framework and governance the frc is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. in addition, the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to northern trust. compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:
•   regulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 81
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   financial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.
compliance risk framework and governance the compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee.
each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. each business is responsible for its respective employees' compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust's compliance and ethics program.
the ceoc establishes and monitors adherence to northern trust's compliance and ethics program. the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee, as appropriate, and chairs the ceoc.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events.
liquidity risk overview northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile. northern trust's balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. that is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits. this liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. northern trust's balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.
liquidity risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
the liquidity management policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities. the asset and liability management committee (alco) provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, lcr, and stress test results.
market and liquidity risk management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. the mlrc provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.
liquidity risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.
the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. both northern trust's treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. holistic liquidity metrics
82 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations such as lcr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.
market risk there are two types of market risk, interest rate risk and trading risk. interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.
market risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
the asset and liability management policy, policy on dealer trading activities, and exposure limits for market risk are set by board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (nii), sensitivity of market value of equity (mve), and value-at-risk (var) across a range of time horizons.
treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities. alco provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as stress test results.

interest rate risk overview interest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in northern trust's financial position (e.g. interest income, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. nii and mve sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the mve. to mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are sufficiently correlated, which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.
there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk in the banking book:
•   repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;
•   yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;
•   basis, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and
•   embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.
interest rate risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: nii and mve sensitivity. nii sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii. mve sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on mve based on the period-end balance sheet.
northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:
•   purchase of securities;
•   sale of debt securities that are classified as available for sale;
•   issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;
•   collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank;
•   placing and taking eurodollar time deposits; and
•   hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 83
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nii sensitivity the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation:
•   the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;
•   prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;
•   cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;
•   nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on northern trust's actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and
•   new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.
the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward and 100 basis point downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.

the nii sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. for that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.
mve sensitivity mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. northern trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation:
84 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of northern trust's actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment-some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives;
•   the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values; and
•   monte carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.
the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates.

foreign currency risk overview northern trust's balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-u.s. subsidiaries, and future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense. to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trust's currency exposure to future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense.
in addition, northern trust provides global foreign exchange (gfx) services to clients. most of these services are provided in connection with northern trust's growing global custody business. in the normal course of business, northern trust also engages in trading of non-u.s. currencies for its own account. both activities are considered trading activities.
foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the u.s. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. the gfx trading portfolio at northern trust is composed of spot, forward, and non-deliverable foreign currency transactions. for gfx, spot risk is driven primarily by foreign exchange rate (fx) risk, and forward risk is driven primarily by interest rate (ir) risk.
foreign currency risk measurement northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-u.s. currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology. this statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-u.s. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.
var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trust's trading systems each day. data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.
foreign currency risk monitoring, reporting and analysis northern trust monitors several variations of the gfx var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, monte carlo simulation and taylor approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent vars using only fx drivers and only
2019 annual report | northern trust corporation 85
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ir drivers, and look back periods of one year, two years, and four years. those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust's market risks.
automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.
the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for gfx in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. the total var for gfx is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

during 2019, northern trust experienced one day of actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate. during 2018, northern trust did not incur an actual gfx trading loss in excess of the daily gfx var estimate.
other nonmaterial trading activities market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. northern trust's broker-dealer subsidiary, northern trust securities, inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes, which averaged $1.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019.
northern trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps and swaptions entered into to meet clients' interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps and floors. all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by northern trust's treasury department. when northern trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities.
strategic risk strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. strategic risk includes the following three subcategories:
•   macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, which centers on events or themes that would have a significant, detrimental impact on financial markets, and by extension, financial services firms. episodes of this kind would tend to have general, as opposed to idiosyncratic, consequences.
•   business risk, which arises from change in the following areas:
•   internal: situations within northern trust that threaten business continuity, profitability, or the achievement of strategic objectives
•   secular: behavioral or technological change that affects clients and renders a northern trust process or service obsolete
•   competitive: new products or shifts in the industry landscape that challenge northern trust's performance
•   regulatory: changes to prudential or fiscal policy that have an adverse impact on northern trust or its clients
•   reputation risk is a residual risk which arises from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects northern trust's ability to conduct its business. reputation risk can arise from a range of risk events and is not limited to strategic risk.
strategic risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies and practices designed to identify, analyze, and limit (where possible) the impact of strategic risk. the strategic risk management function is responsible for defining this framework and providing independent oversight of its application across northern trust. in furtherance of this effort, northern trust has established governance around its strategic planning processes to review and challenge strategic decisions.
86 2019 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition, northern trust maintains a global stress testing framework which guides stress testing exercises across the company. enterprise stress testing, a component of this effort, is specifically designed to look at the prospective impact of internal and external shocks on the organization. northern trust also maintains the global emergency response plan, which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise.
both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which northern trust monitors and controls strategic risk.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at&t inc. is referred to as "we," "at&t" or the "company" throughout this document, and the names of the particular subsidiaries and affiliates providing the services generally have been omitted. at&t is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications, media and technology industries. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes (notes). we completed the acquisition of time warner inc. (time warner) on june 14, 2018, and have included its results after that date. in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), operating results from time warner prior to the acquisition are excluded.
our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this document generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this document can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
we have four reportable segments: (1) communications, (2) warnermedia, (3) latin america and (4) xandr. our segment results presented in note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting. we analyze our segments based on segment operating contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each segment. each segment's percentage calculation of total segment operating revenue and contribution is derived from our segment results table in note 4 and may total more than 100% due to losses in one or more segments. percentage increases and decreases that are not considered meaningful are denoted with a dash. we have recast our segment results for all prior periods presented to exclude wireless and wireline operations in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands from our mobility and business wireline business units of the communications segment, instead reporting them with corporate and other (see note 6).

overview
28
at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts operating revenues increased in 2019, primarily due to including a full year's worth of time warner results, which was acquired in june 2018. partially offsetting the increase were declines in the communications segment driven by continued pressure in legacy and video services and lower wireless equipment upgrades that were offset by growth in advanced data and wireless services.
operations and support expenses increased in 2019, primarily due to our 2018 acquisition of time warner and the abandonment of certain copper assets that will not be necessary to support future network activity (see note 7). the increase was partially offset by lower costs in our communications segment, specifically fewer subscribers contributing to lower content costs, lower upgrades driving a decline in wireless equipment costs and our continued focus on cost management.
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2019.
amortization expense decreased $415, or 5.0%, in 2019 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles associated with warnermedia. we expect continued declines in amortization expense, reflecting the accelerated method of amortization applied to certain of the warnermedia intangibles.
depreciation expense increased $202, or 1.0%, in 2019 primarily due to the time warner acquisition.
operating income increased in 2019 and 2018. our operating margin was 15.4% in 2019, compared to 15.3% in 2018 and 12.4% in 2017.
interest expense increased in 2019, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with putting spectrum into network service.
equity in net income (loss) of affiliates increased in 2019, primarily due to the sale of hulu, which had losses of $44 in 2019 and $105 in 2018. (see note 6)
other income (expense) - net decreased in 2019 primarily due to the recognition of $5,171 in actuarial losses, compared to gains of $3,412 in 2018. also contributing to the decline were higher debt redemption costs, partially offset by increased income from rabbi trusts and other investments and gains from the sales of nonstrategic assets.
income tax expense decreased in 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in income before income taxes. our effective tax rate was 18.9% in 2019, 19.8% in 2018, and (97.2)% in 2017. all years were impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act, which was enacted in 2017.
segment results our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting. in addition to segment operating contribution, we also evaluate segment performance based on ebitda and/or ebitda margin. ebitda is defined as segment operating contribution, excluding equity in net income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. we believe ebitda to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance. ebitda does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. ebitda margin is ebitda divided by total revenues.

operating revenues decreased in 2019, driven by declines in our entertainment group and business wireline business units, partially offset by increases in our mobility business unit. the decrease reflects the continued shift away from legacy voice and data products and linear video, largely offset by higher wireless service revenues from growth in postpaid phone subscribers and average revenue per subscriber (arpu), and growth in our prepaid subscriber base.
operating contribution increased in 2019 and 2018. the 2019 contribution includes improvements in our mobility and entertainment group business units, partially offset by declines in our business wireline business unit. our communications segment operating income margin was 22.6% in 2019, 22.3% in 2018 and 21.1% in 2017.

calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who canceled service during a month divided by the total number of wireless subscribers at the beginning of that month. the churn rate for the period is equal to the average of the churn rate for each month of that period.
service revenue increased during 2019 largely due to prepaid subscriber gains and higher postpaid phone arpu driven by the adoption of unlimited plans.
arpu arpu increased primarily due to pricing actions that were not in effect in the prior year and a continued shift by subscribers to our unlimited plans.

dollars in millions except per share amounts the effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins. competitive pricing in the industry contributed to higher postpaid churn rates in 2019, and our move to unlimited plans combined with an improved customer experience in 2018 contributed to lower churn rates in that year.
equipment revenue decreased in 2019. the 2019 decrease was driven by lower postpaid sales, resulting from the continuing trend of customers choosing to upgrade devices less frequently or bring their own, which is generally offset by lower equipment expense.
operations and support expenses decreased in 2019, primarily due to lower equipment expense driven by low upgrade rates and increased operational efficiencies, partially offset by higher bad debt expense and handset insurance costs.
depreciation expenses decreased in 2019, primarily due to fully depreciated assets, partially offset by ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion.
operating income increased in 2019 and 2018. our mobility operating income margin was 31.4% in 2019, 30.6% in 2018 and 28.5% in 2017. our mobility ebitda margin was 42.7% in 2019, 42.3% in 2018 and 39.8% in 2017.
subscriber relationships as the wireless industry has matured, we believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices that take advantage of our premier 5g wireless network, and to provide these services in bundled product offerings. subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service. to support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible.
to attract and retain subscribers in a mature and highly competitive market, we have launched a wide variety of plans, including our firstnet and prepaid products, and arrangements that bundle our video services. virtually all of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on plans that provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates, and such subscribers tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates. such offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services and/or add devices, attract subscribers from other providers and/or minimize subscriber churn. we also offer unlimited data plans and such subscribers also tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates.
connected devices connected devices include data-centric devices such as wholesale automobile systems, monitoring devices, fleet management and session-based tablets. connected device subscribers increased in 2019, and we added approximately 8.4 million wholesale connected cars through agreements with various carmakers, and experienced strong growth in other internet of things (iot) connections as well. we believe that these connected car agreements give us the opportunity to create future retail relationships with the car owners.

video entertainment revenues are comprised of subscription and advertising revenues. revenues decreased in 2019, largely driven by a 15.0% decline in premium tv subscribers, as we continue to focus on high-value customers, partially offset by subscription-based advertising growth of 4.8%. our customers continue to shift, consistent with the rest of the industry, from a premium linear service to our more economically priced ott video service, or to competitors, which has pressured our video revenues.
revenue declines in our premium tv products were partially offset by growth in revenues from our ott service, at&t tv now, which were primarily attributable to pricing actions. at&t tv now subscriber net additions declined in 2019 due to price increases and fewer promotions.
high-speed internet revenues increased in 2019, reflecting higher arpu resulting from the continued shift of subscribers to our higher-speed fiber services. our bundling strategy is helping to lower churn with subscribers who bundle broadband with another at&t service.
legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2019, reflecting the continued migration of customers to our more advanced ip-based offerings or to competitors. the trend at which we are experiencing these revenue declines has slowed, with a decrease of $468 in 2019 compared to $726 in 2018.
operations and support expenses decreased in 2019, largely driven by lower content costs from fewer subscribers and our ongoing focus on cost initiatives. partially offsetting the decreases were higher amortization of fulfillment cost deferrals, including the impact of second-quarter updates to decrease the estimated economic life for our entertainment group customers, and costs associated with nfl sunday ticket. we expect the second-quarter 2019 update to estimated economic customer lives, and our launch of at&t tv, our new streaming premium tv product, to contribute to expense pressure in the first half of 2020.
depreciation expenses decreased in 2019, due to network assets becoming fully depreciated. partially offsetting the decreases was ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion, including the completion of the fiber commitment under the directv acquisition.
operating income increased in 2019 and decreased in 2018. our entertainment group operating income margin was 10.7% in 2019, 10.1% in 2018 and 10.9% in 2017. our entertainment group ebitda margin was 22.4% in 2019, 21.6% in 2018 and 22.2% in 2017.

our warnermedia segment consists of our turner, home box office and warner bros. business units. the order of presentation reflects the consistency of revenue streams, rather than overall magnitude as that is subject to timing and frequency of studio releases. warnermedia also includes our financial results for regional sports networks (rsns).
the warnermedia segment does not include results from time warner operations for the periods prior to our june 14, 2018 acquisition. otter media is included as an equity method investment for periods prior to our august 7, 2018 acquisition of the remaining interest and is in the segment operating results following the acquisition. consistent with our past practice, many of the impacts of the fair value adjustments from the application of purchase accounting required under gaap have not been allocated to the segment, instead they are reported as acquisition-related items in the reconciliation to consolidated results.
due to the june 2018 acquisition of time warner, segment and business unit results for 2019 are not comparable to prior periods, and, therefore, comparative results are not discussed.

operating revenues primarily relate to theatrical product (which is content made available for initial exhibition in theaters) and television product (which is content made available for initial airing on television or ott services). during 2019, fourth-quarter revenues were pressured from foregone content licensing revenues as we prepare for our launch of hbo max in 2020 and lower theatrical product resulting from a more favorable mix of box office and home entertainment releases in the prior year. the timing of theatrical releases varies from year to year and is based on several factors. the variability of the release

operating environment and trends of the business
2020 revenue trends we expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand premium content, instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements through 5g deployment. in our communications segment, we expect that our network quality and first responder network authority (firstnet) deployment will contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth, and that 5g handset introductions during 2020 will drive wireless equipment revenue growth. we anticipate that applications like video streaming will also drive greater demand for broadband. in our warnermedia segment, we expect our premium content

dollars in millions except per share amounts to drive revenue growth from both the current wholesale distribution through traditional pay-tv providers and our new video streaming platform, hbo max, to be launched in may 2020. across at&t, we expect to provide consumers with a broad variety of video entertainment services, from mobile-centric and ott live-tv streaming packages, to traditional full-size linear video. we expect growth in our advertising businesses from combining the data insights from our 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships with our premium video and digital advertising inventory. revenue from business customers will continue to grow for mobile and ip-based services, but decline for legacy wireline services. overall, we believe growth in wireless, broadband and warnermedia's premium content should offset pressure from our linear video and legacy voice and data services.
2020 expense trends we expect the spending required to support growth initiatives, primarily our 5g deployment and firstnet build, as well as the launch of the hbo max platform, to pressure expense trends in 2020. to the extent 5g handset introductions in 2020 are as expected, the expenses associated with those device sales will also contribute to higher costs. in addition, we expect the second-quarter 2019 update to estimated economic customer lives, and our launch of at&t tv, our new streaming premium tv product, to contribute to expense pressure in the first half of the year. during 2020, we will also continue to transition our hardware-based network technology to more efficient and less expensive software-based technology. these investments will prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality and "smart" technologies. the software benefits of our 5g wireless technology and new video delivery platforms should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years.
to offset the costs of these initiatives, we anticipate savings from corporate initiatives to lower labor-related costs and corporate overhead, digital transformation of customer service and ordering functions, vendor discounts and warnermedia merger synergies. cost savings and non-strategic asset sales should help to further reduce our debt level.
market conditions the u.s. stock market experienced a positive year although general business investment remained modest, which affected our business services. most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on chinese goods. to date, we have not experienced any disruptions from our wireless handset supply chain due to the coronavirus epidemic in china but we continue to monitor the situation. while unemployment remains historically low, our residential customers continue to be price sensitive in selecting offerings, especially in the video area, and continue to focus on products that give them efficient access to video and broadcast services. we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2020 as we respond to the competitive marketplace, especially in wireless and video services.
included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended (erisa). we expect only minimal erisa contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2020. investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. in addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in other income (expense) - net. changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2020 (see "critical accounting policies and estimates").
operating environment overview at&t subsidiaries operating within the united states are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. at&t subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided.
in the telecommunications act of 1996 (telecom act), congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. nonetheless, over the ensuing two decades, the federal communications commission (fcc) and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. more recently, the fcc has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. in addition, we are pursuing, at both the state and federal levels, additional legislative and regulatory

at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts measures to reduce regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive telecommunications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ip-based networks. at the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.
we have organized the following discussion by reportable segment.
communications segment internet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. although the d.c. circuit upheld the fcc's current classification, challenges to that decision remain pending. a more detailed discussion can be found under "regulatory developments".
a number of states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the fcc, and in some cases, established additional requirements. suits have been filed concerning laws in certain states, but have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals. we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet. a more detailed discussion can be found under "regulatory developments".
in october 2016, the fcc adopted new rules governing the use of customer information by providers of broadband internet access service. those rules were more restrictive in certain respects than those governing other participants in the internet economy, including so-called "edge" providers such as google and facebook. in april 2017, the president signed a resolution passed by congress repealing the new rules under the congressional review act.
privacy-related legislation has been considered or adopted in a number of states. legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. effective as of january 1, 2020, a california state law gives consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them, and whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed, and to access and request deletion of this information. subject to certain exceptions, it also gives california consumers the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.
wireless the industry-wide deployment of 5g technology, which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of "small cell" equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms. federal regulations also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services, including small cell equipment. in march, august and september 2018, the fcc adopted orders to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review processes in order to facilitate deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. specifically, the fcc's march 2018 order streamlined historical, tribal, and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure, including by excluding most small cell facilities from such review. the order was appealed and in august 2019, the d.c. circuit court of appeals vacated the fcc's finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review, but otherwise upheld the fcc's order. the fcc's august and september 2018 orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government right-of-way access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services. those orders were appealed to the 9th circuit court of appeals, where they remain pending. in addition to the fcc's actions, to date, 28 states and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment.
in december 2018, we introduced the nation's first commercial mobile 5g service. we expect to have mobile 5g service available nationwide to more than 200 million people by the second quarter of 2020; we anticipate the introduction of 5g handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades.
as the u.s. wireless industry has matured, we believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices and to provide these services in bundled product offerings to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible. we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as to secure and utilize spectrum that meets our long-term needs. we secured the firstnet contract, which provides us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum, and invested in 5g and millimeter-wave technologies with our acquisition of fiber-tower corporation, which holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands (39 ghz) that the fcc reallocated for mobile broadband
43
at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts services. we were also awarded 24 ghz licenses covering a nationwide footprint in a recent fcc auction. these bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5g services.
video we provide domestic satellite video service through our subsidiary directv, whose satellites are licensed by the fcc. the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the u.s. operations of directv, and some of warnermedia's businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations.
warnermedia segment we create, own and distribute intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks and licenses of intellectual property. to protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and license agreements. outside of the u.s., laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country. the european union commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives that could impair warner bros.' current country-by-country licensing approach in the european union. piracy, particularly of digital content, continues to threaten warnermedia's revenues from products and services, and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including technological and legislative solutions. outside the u.s., various laws and regulations, as well as trade agreements with the u.s., also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in movie theaters and on broadcast and cable networks. for example, in certain countries, including china, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year.
expected growth areas over the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless, software-based video offerings like hbo max, ip-based broadband services and advertising and data insights (especially with warnermedia). we now provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the u.s. on an integrated telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms, including wireless, satellite and wireline. in 2020, our key initiatives include:
launching 5g service nationwide on our premier wireless network.
generating mobile subscriber growth from firstnet and our premier network quality.
launching hbo max, our new platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers, as well as through our traditional distributors.
increasing fiber penetration and growing broadband revenues.
continuing to develop a competitive advantage through our industry-leading network cost structure.
growing profitability in our mexico business unit.
wireless we expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation converged services that combine technologies and services. we secured the firstnet contract, which provides us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum and the opportunity to grow subscribers through the first responder agencies served, and invested in 5g and millimeter-wave technologies with our acquisition of fibertower corporation, which holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands (39 ghz) that the fcc reallocated for mobile broadband services. these bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5g services.
as of december 31, 2019, we served 185 million wireless subscribers in north america, with 166 million in the united states. our lte technology covers over 430 million people in north america, and in the united states, we cover all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people. we also provide 4g coverage using another technology (hspa+), and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. in december 2018, we introduced the nation's first commercial mobile 5g service and plan to expand that deployment nationwide by the second quarter of 2020 to cover approximately 200 million people.
our networks covering both the u.s. and mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies' networks. we believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. as of the end of 2019, we provided lte coverage to approximately 100 million people in mexico.
integration of data/broadband and entertainment services as the communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of blending wireline, satellite and wireless services, we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and provide high-speed internet and video offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or
44

dollars in millions except per share amounts business fixed services with their mobile service. during 2020, we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video, mobile and broadband solutions. the launch of the hbo max platform will facilitate our customers' desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourage customer retention.
regulatory developments set forth below is a summary of the most significant regulatory proceedings that directly affected our operations during 2019. industry-wide regulatory developments are discussed above in operating environment overview. while these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words "we," "at&t" and "our" are used to simplify the discussion. the following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues.
international regulation our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business), wireless and satellite television services. at&t is engaged in multiple efforts with foreign regulators to open markets to competition, foster conditions favorable to investment and increase our scope of services and products.
the general data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may of 2018. at&t processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees. this regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance.
federal regulation we have organized our following discussion by service impacted.
internet in february 2015, the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services, subject to title ii of the communications act. the order, which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent, significantly expanded the fcc's authority to regulate broadband internet access services, as well as internet interconnection arrangements. in december 2017, the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015. in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions, the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service, including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization. several parties appealed the fcc's december 2017 decision and the d.c. circuit heard oral argument on the appeals on february 1, 2019. on october 1, 2019, the court issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc's reclassification of broadband as an information service, and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality. while the court vacated the fcc's express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality, it nevertheless stressed that its ruling does not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc's regulatory objectives and framework. the court also concluded that the fcc failed to satisfy its obligation under the administrative procedure act (apa) to consider the impact of its 2017 order in three discrete areas: public safety, the lifeline program, and pole attachment regulation, and thus remanded it to the fcc for further proceedings on those issues, but without disturbing the operative effect of that order. several petitions for rehearing of the d.c. circuit's october 1 decision have been filed. those petitions remain pending. a number of states have adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed. in some cases, state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc's february 2015 order. additionally, some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements. suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont. both lawsuits have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc's december 2017 order. we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements. we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet.
wireless and broadband since november 2017, the fcc has adopted four significant rulings designed to accelerate broadband infrastructure deployment. in november 2017, the fcc updated and streamlined certain rules governing pole attachments, copper retirement, and service discontinuances. in march 2018, the fcc eliminated lengthy environmental, historical and tribal reviews for most small cell deployments and streamlined processes that must be followed when those reviews are required. the d.c. circuit court of appeals vacated the fcc's finding in this order that small cell facilities do not require environmental, historical and tribal reviews, but left intact all other processes adopted to streamline review when required. in august 2018, the fcc adopted more comprehensive pole attachment reform, including by simplifying the attaching process (i.e., one-touch make-ready) and clarified that the communications act precludes local governments from imposing moratoria on the deployment of communications facilities. and, in september 2018, the fcc restricted the ability
45
at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts of state and local governments to impede small cell deployments in rights-of-way and on government-owned structures, through exorbitant fees, unreasonable aesthetic requirements and other actions. these decisions will remove regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5g deployment, which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles and to replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services. appeals of the august and september 2018 orders remain pending in the 9th circuit court of appeals.
in 2018, the fcc took several actions to make spectrum available for 5g services. in late 2018, the fcc adopted auction rules for the 39 ghz band that will allow the fcc to auction remaining unlicensed 39 ghz spectrum and realign the band to allow large, contiguous blocks of spectrum that will support 5g. this auction, which also includes spectrum in the 37 ghz and 47 ghz bands, is currently underway. the fcc has granted at&t special temporary authority to launch its 5g service in 400 mhz of contiguous spectrum in the 37/39 ghz band in a total of 32 markets. in addition, the fcc completed auctions in 2019 of 24 and 28 ghz spectrum, two other bands that will support 5g. at&t was awarded 24 ghz licenses covering a nationwide footprint.
accounting policies and standards critical accounting policies and estimates because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. the following policies are presented in the order in which the topics appear in our consolidated statements of income.
pension and postretirement benefits our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted-average assumptions are discussed in note 15. our assumed weighted-average discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 3.40% and 3.20%, respectively, at december 31, 2019, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. these bonds were all rated at least aa3 or aa- by one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in u.s. dollars, and neither callable, convertible nor index linked. for the year ended december 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, we decreased our pension discount rate by 1.10%, resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of $8,018 and decreased our postretirement discount rate by 1.20%, resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of $2,399.
our expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is 7.00% for 2020 and 2019. our expected long-term rate of return on postretirement plan assets is 4.75% for 2020 and 5.75% for 2019. our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets. if all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2020 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $273, which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year as part of our fourth-quarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans.
we recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in "other income (expense) - net" in our consolidated statements of income. these gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31, and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years. see note 15 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions.
depreciation our depreciation of assets, including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries and estimates of useful lives, is described in notes 1 and 7.
if all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our plant in service would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3,027 in our 2019 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4,196 in our 2019 depreciation expense. see notes 7 and 8 for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property, plant and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use assets.
asset valuations and impairments goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually for impairment. for impairment testing, we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the
46
at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts expected cash flows to be derived from the use of the asset. we recorded an impairment in 2019 for our sky brasil trade name (see note 9).
we test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. if the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. we estimate fair values using an income approach (also known as a discounted cash flow) and a market multiple approach. the income approach utilizes our 10-year cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. the market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units. in 2019, the calculated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their book values in all circumstances. if either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill. in the event of a 10% drop in the fair values of the reporting units, the fair values still would have exceeded the book values of the reporting units.
we assess fair value for u.s. wireless licenses using a discounted cash flow model (the greenfield approach) and a corroborative market approach based on auction prices, depending upon auction activity. the greenfield approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. inputs to the model include subscriber growth, churn, revenue per user, capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber, ongoing operating costs and resulting ebitda margins. we based our assumptions on a combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. these licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the united states. for impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting expected long-term inflation trends. we assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience, but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. we used a discount rate of 8.75%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. if either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value of the licenses. the fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.
orbital slots are also valued using the greenfield approach. the projected cash flows are based on various factors, including satellite cost, other capital investment per subscriber, acquisition costs per subscriber and usage per subscriber, as well as revenue growth, subscriber growth and churn rates. for impairment testing purposes, we assumed sustainable long-term growth assumptions consistent with the business plan and industry counterparts in the united states. we used a discount rate of 8.5% to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. in 2019, the fair value of orbital slots was slightly lower than the prior year, which exceeded the book value by approximately 10% in 2018. the decrease in fair value was driven by the transition of the video business to ott and streaming technology.
we review customer relationships, licenses in mexico and other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life. for this analysis, we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its book value.
we review operating lease right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life.
we periodically assess our network assets for impairment (see note 1).
income taxes our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 14 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.
we use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (utbs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. these adjustments to our utbs may affect our income tax expense. settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.
new accounting standards
47
at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts beginning with 2019 interim and annual reporting periods, we adopted the fasb's new accounting guidance related to leasing. the most significant impact of the new guidance was to our balance sheet, as we recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for our operating leases existing at january 1, 2019. we adopted the new leasing standard using a modified retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the period of adoption, which did not require us to adjust the balance sheet for prior periods, therefore affecting the comparability of our financial statements. see note 1 for discussion of the impact of the standard.
see note 1 for discussion of the expected impact of other new standards.
other business matters unlimited data plan claims in october 2014, the ftc filed a civil suit in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california against at&t mobility, llc seeking injunctive relief and unspecified money damages under section 5 of the federal trade commission act. the ftc's allegations concern the application of at&t's maximum bit rate (mbr) program to customers who enrolled in our unlimited data plan from 2007-2010. mbr temporarily reduces in certain instances the download speeds of a small portion of our legacy unlimited data plan customers each month after the customer exceeds a designated amount of data during the customer's billing cycle. mbr is an industry-standard practice that is designed to affect only the most data-intensive applications (such as video streaming). texts, emails, tweets, social media posts, internet browsing and many other applications are typically unaffected. contrary to the ftc's allegations, our mbr program is permitted by our customer contracts, was fully disclosed in advance to our unlimited data plan customers, and was implemented to protect the network for the benefit of all customers. we reached a tentative agreement (stipulated order) with the ftc staff in august 2019, pending ftc approval. the ftc approved the stipulated order on november 4, 2019, and the court approved and entered the order on december 3, 2019. in the resolution of this matter, we did not admit the ftc's allegations, and the settlement amount is not material to our financial results. in addition to the ftc case, several class actions were filed challenging our mbr program. we have secured dismissals in each of these cases except roberts v. at&t mobility llc, which is ongoing.
labor contracts as of january 31, 2020, we employed approximately 246,000 persons. approximately 40% of our employees are represented by the communications workers of america (cwa), the international brotherhood of electrical workers (ibew) or other unions. after expiration of the collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached.
a contract covering approximately 7,000 traditional wireline employees in our midwest region expired in april 2018. in august 2019, a new four-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in april 2022.
a contract covering approximately 3,000 traditional wireline employees in our legacy at&t corp. business expired in april 2018. in august 2019, a new four-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in april 2022.
a contract covering approximately 18,000 traditional wireline employees in our southeast region expired in august 2019. in october 2019, a new five-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in august 2024.
contracts covering approximately 20,000 employees are scheduled to expire during 2020, including a contract expiring in february covering approximately 7,000 mobility employees and a contract expiring in april covering approximately 13,000 traditional wireline employees in our west region.
environmental we are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. we reference in our forms 10-q and 10-k certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of one hundred thousand dollars or more. however, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources we had $12,130 in cash and cash equivalents available at december 31, 2019. cash and cash equivalents included cash of $2,654 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $9,476. approximately $2,681 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign entities in accounts predominantly outside of the u.s. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation.
cash and cash equivalents increased $6,926 since december 31, 2018. in 2019, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from an increased amount of sales and transfers of our receivables to third parties, sale of investments, issuance of long-term debt, collateral received from banks and other participants in our derivative arrangements and issuances of nonconvertible perpetual preferred interests in subsidiaries and cumulative preferred stock.

at&amp;t inc.

dollars in millions except per share amounts these inflows were offset by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses, debt repayments, funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, spectrum purchases and dividends to stockholders.
cash provided by or used in operating activities during 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $48,668 compared to $43,602 in 2018. higher operating cash flows in 2019 were primarily due to contributions from full year of warnermedia and higher cash flows from working capital initiatives, including sales of receivables (see note 18), partly offset by higher spend on film and television production and net tax payments in 2019 compared to net tax refunds in 2018.
we actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for non-capital items to optimize the use of our cash. among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost. in addition, for payments to a key supplier, we have arrangements that allow us to extend payment terms up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as supplier financing). the net impact of supplier financing on cash from operating activities was to improve working capital $909 in 2019, and $1,869 in 2018. all supplier financing payments are due within one year.
cash used in or provided by investing activities during 2019, cash used in investing activities totaled $16,690, and consisted primarily of $19,635 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures ($1,616 lower than the prior-year), and $982 of wireless spectrum offset by proceeds from the sales of our ownership interests in hulu and warnermedia's headquarters (hudson yards) under a sale-leaseback arrangement (see note 6).
for capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. vendor financing payments were $3,050 in 2019, compared to $560 in 2018. capital expenditures in 2019 were $19,635, and when including $3,050 cash paid for vendor financing and excluding $1,005 of firstnet reimbursements, gross capital investment was $23,690 ($450 higher than the prior-year). the vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. in 2019, we placed $2,632 of equipment in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $2,162 in 2018) and $1,116 of assets related to the firstnet build (compared to $1,500 in 2018). total reimbursements from the government for firstnet were $1,374 for 2019 and $1,670 for 2018, predominately for capital expenditures.
the amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. in 2020, we expect that our gross capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing and excludes expected firstnet reimbursement of approximately $1,000, will be in the $20,000 range.
cash used in or provided by financing activities for the full year, cash used in financing activities totaled $25,083 and included net proceeds from debt issuances of $17,039, which consisted primarily of the following issuances:

our weighted average interest rate of our entire long-term debt portfolio, including the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.4% as of december 31, 2019 and 4.4% as of december 31, 2018. we had $161,109 of total notes and debentures outstanding at december 31, 2019, which included euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, mexican peso, australian dollar, brazilian real and swiss franc denominated debt that totaled approximately $42,485.
at december 31, 2019, we had $11,838 of debt maturing within one year, consisting of $4 of other short-term borrowings and $11,834 of long-term debt issuances. debt maturing within one year includes the following notes that may be put back to us by the holders:
$1,000 of annual put reset securities issued by bellsouth that may be put back to us each april until maturity in 2021.
an accreting zero-coupon note that may be redeemed each may until maturity in 2022. if the remainder of the zero-coupon note (issued for principal of $500 in 2007 and partially exchanged in the 2017 debt exchange offers) is held to maturity, the redemption amount will be $592.
during 2019, we paid $3,050 of cash under our vendor financing program. total vendor financing payables included in our december 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet were approximately $2,067, with $1,625 due within one year (in "accounts

dollars in millions except per share amounts payable and accrued liabilities") and the remainder predominantly due within two to three years (in "other noncurrent liabilities").
financing activities in 2019 also included $7,876 of capital from the issuance of nonconvertible preferred interests issued by subsidiaries and $1,164 for the december issuance of cumulative 5.00% preferred stock. in february 2020, we issued series b and series c preferred stock for approximately $3,900. (see note 17)
at december 31, 2019, we had approximately 319 million shares remaining from share repurchase authorizations approved by the board of directors in 2013 and 2014 (see note 17). for the year ended december 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately 56 million shares under these authorizations. in january 2020, we repurchased $4,000 of at&t common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement (see note 2).
we paid dividends on common shares of $14,888 in 2019 and $13,410 in 2018, primarily reflecting the increase in the number of shares outstanding related to our acquisition of time warner as well as an increase in our quarterly dividend approved by our board of directors in december 2018. dividends declared by our board of directors totaled $2.05 per share in 2019 and $2.01 per share in 2018. our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of at&t and long-term growth opportunities. it is our intent to provide the financial flexibility to allow our board of directors to consider dividend growth and to recommend an increase in dividends to be paid in future periods. all dividends remain subject to declaration by our board of directors.
our 2020 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level, repurchasing common stock and paying dividends, subject to approval by our board of directors. we plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt, issuance of additional preferred stock and asset sales. the timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.
credit facilities the following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our annual report on form 10-k.
we use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. in december 2018, we amended our five-year revolving credit agreement (the "amended and restated credit agreement") and concurrently entered into a new five-year agreement (the "five year credit agreement") such that we now have two $7,500 revolving credit agreements totaling $15,000. the amended and restated credit agreement terminates on december 11, 2021 and the five year credit agreement terminates on december 11, 2023. no amounts were outstanding under either agreement as of december 31, 2019.
in september 2019, we entered into and drew on a $1,300 term loan credit agreement containing (i) a 1.25 year $400 facility due in 2020 (baml tranche a facility), (ii) a 2.25 year $400 facility due in 2021 (baml tranche b facility), and (iii) a 3.25 year $500 facility due in 2022 (baml tranche c facility), with bank of america, n.a., as agent. no repayment had been made under these facilities as of december 31, 2019.
we also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases, as well as a commercial paper program.
each of our credit and loan agreements contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-ebitda financial ratio covenant requiring at&t to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.5-to-1. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.
collateral arrangements during the year, we amended collateral arrangements with certain counterparties to require cash collateral posting by at&t only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. under these arrangements, counterparties are still required to post collateral. during 2019, we received $1,413 of cash collateral, on a net basis, primarily driven by the amended arrangements. cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements.

dollars in millions except per share amounts our total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year) and stockholders' equity. our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investees. at december 31, 2019, our debt ratio was 44.7%, compared to 47.7% at december 31, 2018 and 53.6% at december 31, 2017. our net debt ratio was 41.4% at december 31, 2019, compared to 46.2% at december 31, 2018 and 37.2% at december 31, 2017. the debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects debt issuances, repayments and debt acquired in business combinations.
a significant amount of our cash outflows is related to tax items and benefits paid for current and former employees. total taxes incurred, collected and remitted by at&t during 2019 and 2018, were $24,170 and $22,172. these taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees. total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled $4,059 in 2019, with $941 paid from plan assets. of those benefits, $3,707 related to medical and prescription drug benefits. in addition, in 2019 we prefunded $500 for future benefit payments. during 2019, we paid $6,356 of pension benefits out of plan assets.
during 2019, we received $4,684 from the disposition of assets, and when combined with capital received from issuing preferred interests to external investors, an amendment of collateral arrangements, and working capital monetization initiatives, which include the sale of receivables, total cash received from monetization efforts, net of spectrum acquisitions, was approximately $18,000. we plan to continue to explore similar opportunities.

represents principal or payoff amounts of notes and debentures at maturity or, for putable debt, the next put opportunity (see note 12).
the purchase obligations will be funded with cash provided by operations or through incremental borrowings. the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. if we elect to exit these contracts, termination fees for all such contracts in the year of termination could be approximately $257 in 2020, $344 in the aggregate for 2021 and 2022, $129 in the aggregate for 2023 and 2024, and $22 in the aggregate thereafter. certain termination fees are excluded from the above table, as the fees would not be paid every year and the timing of such payments, if any, is uncertain. (see note 21)
represents operating lease payments (see note 8).
represents contractual commitment to make sustainability payments over the 25-year contract. these sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund firstnet's operating expenses and future reinvestment in the network, which we will own and operate.
firstnet has a statutory requirement to reinvest funds that exceed the agency's operating expenses, which we anticipate to be $15,000. (see note 20)
the noncurrent portion of the utbs is included in the "more than 5 years" column, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time (see note 14).

represents commitments to repurchase shares of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program (see note 2).
certain items were excluded from this table, as the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were not deemed to be an indicator of future payment, the obligations are immaterial or because the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash. these items include: deferred income tax liability of $59,502 (see note 14); net postemployment benefit obligations of $20,316; expected pension and postretirement payments (see note 15); other noncurrent liabilities of $13,412; third-party debt guarantees; and fair value of our interest rate swaps.

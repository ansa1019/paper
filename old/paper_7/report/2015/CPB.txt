item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the company unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us","our" and the "company" refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
we are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. through 2015, we reported the results of operations in the following reportable segments: u.s. simple meals; global baking and snacking; international simple meals and beverages; u.s. beverages; and bolthouse and foodservice.
in 2013, we acquired bolthouse farms and plum. in 2014, we acquired kelsen and divested our european simple meals business. most recently, on june 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of garden fresh gourmet for $232 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. garden fresh gourmet is a provider of refrigerated salsa in north america, and it also produces hummus, dips and tortilla chips. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions, and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our divestiture of the european simple meals business.
key strategies our long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. guided by our purpose - "real food that matters for life's moments," we expect to deliver this goal by executing against a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while also expanding into faster-growing spaces.
new enterprise design we recently implemented a new enterprise design that better aligns with our dual strategy. under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are now organized in three divisions focused mainly on product categories. each division also has a defined portfolio role. the new divisions and their portfolio roles are:
•   americas simple meals and beverages is our largest division. we expect to manage this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and for margin expansion. americas simple meals and beverages, which includes u.s. soup, will serve as a key economic engine for many years to come.
•   global biscuits and snacks is focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving margins. this division unifies our pepperidge farm, arnott's and kelsen businesses around the world.
•   campbell fresh includes bolthouse farms, garden fresh gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. we plan to make focused investments in this division to accelerate sales growth and to expand into new categories in packaged fresh.
in support of our new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new integrated global services (igs) organization to deliver shared services across the company. igs became effective at the beginning of 2016 and is a key element in our efforts to reduce costs while also increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. we are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. in total, we expect the new igs organization and our other cost savings initiatives to generate approximately $250 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018. these savings are above and beyond our existing enabler program. see "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
dual strategy with this new enterprise design in place, we plan to pursue our dual strategy by:
•   providing greater transparency about the food we make;
•   further embracing digital marketing and e-commerce to connect with consumers and customers in new ways;
•   increasing our focus on health and wellbeing; and
•   expanding our presence in developing markets.
14
providing greater product transparency on our www.whatsinmyfood.com website, we are providing consumers with a wide range of detail about how some of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products. initially focused on some of our top u.s. products, such as campbell's condensed tomato and chicken noodle soups, we plan to expand this site to include all of our major products in the u.s. and canada in 2016, with designs to expand globally over the next three fiscal years. we anticipate this enhanced transparency will lead to, or accelerate, changes in our products, including our continued efforts to remove many artificial ingredients where feasible.
embracing digital marketing and e-commerce we plan to complement the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by focusing a larger percentage of our marketing efforts on digital marketing and e-commerce. for example, in 2016 we expect to spend a larger portion of our overall media budget on digital media, while reducing our spending on traditional television media. we also plan to continue our focus on e-commerce capabilities in 2016.
increasing focus on health and wellbeing capitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends towards fresh and/or healthy products, we plan to increase our focus on our fresh and packaged fresh products. while other parts of our business will continue to provide shelf-stable products that are appealing to health-conscious consumers, our new campbell fresh division has a diverse portfolio of fresh and packaged fresh offerings that should help retailers attract these important customers. we expect the campbell fresh division to provide us with the needed scale to better compete in the growing perimeter of traditional retail outlets. the recent acquisition of garden fresh gourmet, which provides refrigerated salsa, hummus and dips, as well as tortilla chips, compliments campbell fresh's existing portfolio.
expanding presence in developing markets in 2016, we plan to continue to focus on expanding our presence in developing markets, especially our global biscuits and snacks business in asia. our new enterprise design unifies all of our biscuit and snacks brands under a single integrated division - global biscuits and snacks. we expect this new structure to help unlock the value of our biscuit and snack brands and to provide a platform to extend these brands across both faster growing developing markets, as well as our existing developed markets.
to support these four imperatives, we will continue to evaluate external development opportunities, ranging from acquisitions to strategic alliances such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships.
executive summary this executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
•   there were 53 weeks in 2014. there were 52 weeks in 2015 and 2013.
•   net sales decreased 2% in 2015 to $8.082 billion, primarily due to the impact of currency translation and one less week compared to the prior year, partly offset by higher selling prices.
•   gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 34.7% from 35.1% a year ago. the decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and increased supply chain costs, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices.
•   administrative expenses increased 3% to $593 million from $573 million a year ago. the current year included $22 million of costs related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives, and higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.
•   earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.21 in 2015, compared to $2.33 a year ago. the current and prior year included expenses of $.25 and $.20 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below. the additional week contributed approximately $.08 per share to earnings from continuing operations in 2014.
earnings from continuing operations attributable to campbell soup company - 2015 compared with 2014
the following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:
•   in 2015, we incurred charges associated with our initiatives to implement a new enterprise design, to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $102 million related to these initiatives. we also incurred pre-tax charges of $22 million recorded in administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives (aggregate impact of $78 million after tax, or $.25 per share). see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information;
•   in 2014, we recognized pre-tax pension settlement charges in cost of products sold of $22 million ($14 million after tax, or $.04 per share) associated with a u.s. pension plan. the settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in sacramento, california;
15
•   on october 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our simple meals business in europe. in 2014, we recorded a loss of $9 million ($6 million after tax, or $.02 per share) on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of our european simple meals business. the loss was included in other expenses. in addition, we recorded tax expense of $7 million ($.02 per share) associated with the sale of the business;

•   in 2013, we implemented several initiatives to improve our u.s. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our u.s. thermal plant network; expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in mexico; improve our pepperidge farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead in north america. in 2014, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $3 million in cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the 2013 initiatives. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information.

(1)   the sum of the individual per share amounts may not add due to rounding.
earnings from continuing operations were $691 million ($2.21 per share) in 2015, compared to $737 million ($2.33 per share) in 2014. the additional week contributed approximately $25 million ($.08 per share) to earnings from continuing operations in 2014. after adjusting for the 53rd week and other items impacting comparability, earnings decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in sales on a constant currency basis, lower marketing and selling expenses, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. currency translation had a negative impact of $.06 on earnings per share in the current year. earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program.
we sold our european simple meals business on october 28, 2013. see "discontinued operations" for additional information.

(1)   the sum of the individual per share amounts may not add due to rounding.
earnings from continuing operations were $737 million ($2.33 per share) in 2014, compared to $689 million ($2.17 per share) in 2013. after adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the benefit of the additional week and lower marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage, lower sales (excluding the impact of acquisitions and the 53rd week), and a higher effective tax rate. the additional week contributed approximately $25 million ($.08 per share) to earnings from continuing operations in 2014.
net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests we own a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture formed with swire pacific limited to support the development of our soup and broth business in china. the joint venture began operations on january 31, 2011. in 2014, together with our joint venture partner, we agreed to restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china. the after-tax restructuring charge attributable to the noncontrolling interest was $5 million.
we also own a 70% controlling interest in a malaysian food products manufacturing company.
the noncontrolling interests' share in the net earnings (loss) was included in net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of earnings.

in 2015, u.s. simple meals sales were comparable to the year-ago period. u.s. soup sales declined 3%, with 1% due to the impact of the 53rdweek. further details of u.s. soup include:
•   sales of campbell's condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in both eating and cooking varieties. lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending.
•   sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 5%.
•   broth sales increased 3% due to gains in aseptically-packaged broth, partially offset by declines in canned broth.
sales of other simple meals increased 5%, primarily due to growth in prego pasta sauces, plum products and campbell's dinner sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meal products.
in 2014, u.s. simple meals sales increased 3%. u.s. soup sales decreased 1%. excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, u.s. soup sales decreased 2%. further details of u.s. soup, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, include:
•   sales of campbell's condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in eating varieties partially offset by gains in cooking varieties. lower volumes and increased promotional spending were partly offset by higher selling prices.

earnings from u.s. simple meals decreased 5% in 2015 versus 2014. the decrease was due to cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, higher selling prices and the benefit of lapping the plum recall in the prior year.
earnings from u.s. simple meals decreased 2% in 2014 versus 2013. the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the plum product recall in november 2013, partly offset by lower administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the additional week.
earnings from global baking and snacking increased 5% in 2015 versus 2014. the increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, higher selling prices and sales volume gains, partially offset by cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, increased marketing expenses and the impact of currency translation. the operating earnings increase reflected improvement in kelsen due to lapping the negative impact of purchase accounting in 2014 and growth in pepperidge farm, partly offset by lower earnings in arnott's, which were impacted by currency translation.
earnings from global baking and snacking increased 5% in 2014 versus 2013. operating earnings increased primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the kelsen acquisition, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the additional week, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the impact of currency translation. the operating earnings increase reflected growth in pepperidge farm and the addition of kelsen's operating results, partly offset by lower earnings in arnott's.
earnings from international simple meals and beverages decreased 25% in 2015 versus 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the adverse impact of currency movements on input costs and the impact of currency translation.

earnings from bolthouse and foodservice decreased 9% in 2015 versus 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage in bolthouse carrots, juice concentrate and fiber, reflecting higher carrot costs due in part to adverse weather, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin percentage in bolthouse premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, reflecting lower promotional spending.
earnings from bolthouse and foodservice increased 1% in 2014 versus 2013. the increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the increase in sales and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing investment for bolthouse farms.
unallocated corporate expenses in 2015 included costs of $22 million related to the implementation of our new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives. unallocated corporate expenses in 2014 included pension settlement charges of $22 million
21
associated with a u.s. pension plan. the settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in sacramento, california. in addition, 2014 included a $9 million loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the european simple meals business and $3 million of restructuring-related costs. the remaining change was primarily due to lower losses on open commodity hedges in 2015. unallocated corporate expenses in 2013 included $91 million of restructuring-related costs and $10 million of transaction costs associated with the bolthouse farms acquisition. the remaining decrease in expenses in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and gains on foreign exchange transactions.
interest expense/income interest expense decreased to $108 million in 2015 from $122 million in 2014, reflecting lower average levels of debt.
interest expense decreased to $122 million in 2014 from $135 million in 2013, reflecting lower interest rates on the debt portfolio. interest income decreased to $3 million from $10 million in 2013, primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.
taxes on earnings the effective tax rate was 30.2% in 2015, 32.3% in 2014 and 28.8% in 2013. in 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $46 million on $124 million of restructuring charges and implementation costs. in 2014, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million on $22 million of pension settlement charges associated with a u.s. pension plan. in addition, 2014 also included a tax benefit of $17 million on $58 million of restructuring charges and related costs, a tax expense of $7 million associated with the sale of the european simple meals business and a tax benefit of $3 million on a loss of $9 million on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the business. after adjusting for items impacting comparability, the remaining decrease in the effective rate in 2015 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the u.s. and canada.
in 2013, we recognized a tax benefit of $55 million on $152 million of restructuring charges and related costs and acquisition transaction costs. after adjusting for items impacting comparability, the remaining increase in the effective rate in 2014 was primarily due to the 2013 rate benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of state tax matters.
restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives
2015 initiatives on january 29, 2015, we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following divisions: americas simple meals and beverages, global biscuits and snacks, and campbell fresh.
in support of the new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new igs organization to deliver shared services across the company. igs, which became effective at the beginning of 2016, is expected to reduce costs while increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. we are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time.
as part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain u.s.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria. a total of 471 employees elected the program. the electing employees remained with us through july 31, 2015, with some remaining beyond july 31. we also implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 230 positions. in 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $102 million related to these initiatives.
finally, we incurred charges of $22 million recorded in administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives.
the aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and implementation and other costs recorded in 2015 was $78 million, or $.25 per share. a summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2015 initiatives is as follows:
(millions)                               recognized as of august 2, 2015
severance pay and benefits               $94
implementation and other costs            30
total                                   $124
the total estimated pre-tax costs for the 2015 initiatives are approximately $250 million to $325 million. we expect the costs to consist of approximately $150 million to $163 million in severance pay and benefits, and approximately $100 million to $162 million in implementation and other costs.we expect the total pre-tax costs related to the 2015 initiatives will be associated with
22
segments as follows: u.s. simple meals - approximately 21%; global baking and snacking - approximately 28%; international simple meals and beverages - approximately 6%; u.s. beverages - approximately 5%; bolthouse and foodservice - approximately 5%; and corporate - approximately 35%.
we expect substantially all costs to be cash expenditures, except for $7 million of non-cash postretirement and pension curtailment costs. we expect to incur the costs through 2018, and fund the costs through cash and short-term borrowings.
we expect the 2015 initiatives to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $145 million in 2016, and once fully implemented, annual ongoing savings of approximately $250 million beginning in 2018. in 2015, pre-tax savings were $85 million.
segment operating results do not include restructuring charges and implementation and other costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. a summary of the pre-tax costs incurred to date associated with segments is as follows:

2014 initiatives in 2014, we implemented initiatives to reduce overhead across the organization, restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in china and improve supply chain efficiency in australia. details of the 2014 initiatives include:
•   we streamlined our salaried workforce in north america and our workforce in the asia pacific region. approximately 250 positions were eliminated.
•   together with our joint venture partner swire pacific limited, we restructured manufacturing and streamlined operations for our soup and broth business in china. as a result, certain assets were impaired, and approximately 100 positions were eliminated.
•   in australia, we implemented an initiative to improve supply chain efficiency by relocating production from our biscuit plant in marleston to huntingwood. the relocation will continue through 2017 and will result in the elimination of approximately 90 positions.
•   we implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 85 positions. the actions were completed in 2015.
in 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $54 million ($33 million after tax, or $.10 per share, in earnings from continuing operations attributable to campbell soup company) related to the 2014 initiatives.
a summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2014 initiatives is as follows:
(millions)                        total program severance pay and benefits           $41
asset impairment                      12
other exit costs                       1
total                                $54
as of the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred substantially all of the costs related to the 2014 initiatives. of the aggregate $54 million of pre-tax costs, approximately $41 million represented cash expenditures. in addition, we expect to invest approximately $6 million in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate biscuit production and packaging capabilities, of which we invested approximately $3 million as of august 2, 2015. we do not expect the remaining cash outflows related to these restructuring initiatives to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
the 2014 initiatives generated pre-tax savings of approximately $26 million in 2014 and $57 million in 2015. we expect to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $65 million beginning in 2016.
segment operating results do not include restructuring charges because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. the total pre-tax costs of $54 million associated with segments were as follows: u.s. simple meals - $8 million; global baking and snacking - $23 million; international simple meals and beverages - $18 million; u.s. beverages - $2 million; bolthouse and foodservice - $2 million; and corporate - $1 million.

2013 initiatives in 2013, we implemented initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities and reduce costs. details of the 2013 initiatives include:
•   we implemented initiatives to improve our u.s. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our u.s. thermal plant network, including closing our sacramento, california, thermal plant, which produced soups, sauces and beverages. the closure resulted in the elimination of approximately 700 full-time positions and was completed in phases. most of the positions were eliminated in 2013, and operations ceased in august 2013. we shifted the majority of sacramento's soup, sauce and beverage production to our thermal plants in maxton, north carolina; napoleon, ohio; and paris, texas. we also closed our south plainfield, new jersey, spice plant, which resulted in the elimination of 27 positions. we consolidated spice production at our milwaukee, wisconsin, plant in 2013.
•   in mexico, we entered into commercial arrangements with third-party providers to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities. the third-party providers produce and distribute our beverages, soups, broths and sauces throughout the mexican market. as a result of these agreements, we closed our plant in villagrán, mexico, and eliminated approximately 260 positions in the first quarter of 2014.
•   we implemented an initiative to improve our pepperidge farm bakery supply chain cost structure by closing our plant in aiken, south carolina. the plant was closed in may 2014. we shifted the majority of aiken's bread production to our bakery plant in lakeland, florida. approximately 110 positions were eliminated as a result of the plant closure.
•   we streamlined our salaried workforce in u.s. simple meals, north america foodservice and u.s. beverages by approximately 70 positions. this action was substantially completed in august 2013.
in 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1 million related to the 2013 initiatives. in addition, we recorded approximately $3 million of costs related to the 2013 initiatives in cost of products sold, representing other exit costs. the aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2014 was $3 million, or $.01 per share. in 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge of $51 million. in addition, we recorded approximately $91 million of costs related to these initiatives in 2013 in cost of products sold, representing accelerated depreciation and other exit costs. the aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2013 was $90 million, or $.28 per share.
a summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2013 initiatives is as follows:
(millions)                                       total program severance pay and benefits                          $35

total                                              $146
as of the fourth quarter of 2015, we substantially completed the 2013 initiatives. of the aggregate $146 million of pre-tax costs, approximately $43 million represented cash expenditures. in addition, we invested approximately $30 million in capital expenditures as of august 2, 2015, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line, and relocate bread production.
beginning in 2015, the 2013 initiatives generated annual ongoing pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million. in 2014, savings were approximately $30 million.
segment operating results do not include restructuring charges and related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. the total pre-tax costs of $146 million associated with segments were as follows: u.s. simple meals - $90 million; global baking and snacking - $14 million; international simple meals and beverages - $9 million; u.s. beverages - $31 million; and bolthouse and foodservice - $2 million.

discontinued operations on october 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our european simple meals business to soppa investments s.à r.l., an affiliate of cvc capital partners. the all-cash preliminary sale price was €400 million, or $548 million, and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $141 million ($72 million after tax, or $.23 per share) in 2014.
we have reflected the results of the european simple meals business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment.

in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an impairment charge on the intangible assets of this business of $396 million ($263 million after tax, or $.83 per share). in addition, we recorded $18 million in tax expense ($.06 per share) representing taxes on the difference between the book value and tax basis of the business. see also notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
liquidity and capital resources we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
we generated cash from operations of $1.182 billion in 2015, compared to $899 million in 2014. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the european simple meals business and lower pension contributions in 2015, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
we generated cash from operations of $899 million in 2014, compared to $1.019 billion in 2013. the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the european simple meals business, partly offset by lower working capital requirements.
capital expenditures were $380 million in 2015, $347 million in 2014 and $336 million in 2013. capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2016. capital expenditures in 2015 included a cracker capacity expansion at pepperidge farm (approximately $36 million); a bolthouse farms beverage and salad dressing capacity expansion project (approximately $33 million); the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in north america (also known as the soup common platform initiative) (approximately $30 million); a bolthouse farms warehouse capacity expansion project (approximately $13 million); biscuit capacity expansion in indonesia (approximately $13 million); continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million); and aseptic broth capacity expansion (approximately $6 million). capital expenditures in 2014 included capacity expansion at pepperidge farm (approximately $48 million); the ongoing soup common platform initiative in north america (approximately $22 million); broth capacity expansion (approximately $15 million); continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million); a flexible beverage production line for bolthouse farms (approximately $11 million); the refurbishment of a beverage filling and packaging line for the u.s. beverages business (approximately $10 million); the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of our australian biscuit plants (approximately $10 million); and an advanced planning system in north america (approximately $4 million). capital expenditures in 2013 included the soup capacity expansion project for the north america foodservice business (approximately $42 million); capacity expansion at pepperidge farm (approximately $38 million); the ongoing soup common platform initiative in north america (approximately $20 million); the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of our australian biscuit plants (approximately $19 million); and an advanced planning system in north america (approximately $11 million).

off-balance sheet arrangements and other commitments we guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans to pepperidge farm independent sales distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $192 million. our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. we do not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. see also note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation in 2015, inflation in cost of products sold was higher than 2014, and 2014 was higher than 2013. we continue to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.
market risk sensitivity the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. in addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. international operations, which accounted for 21% of 2015 net sales, are concentrated principally in australia and canada. we manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. we enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. we also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, soybean oil, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa, butter, corn and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials.
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of august 2, 2015. fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 13 through 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

we had an additional number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies with a notional value of $7 million as of august 2, 2015. the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a gain of $10 million as of august 2, 2015. the total notional value of forward exchange contracts outstanding was $260 million, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $1 million as of august 3, 2014.
we enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. the notional value of these contracts was $95 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of august 2, 2015. the notional value of these contracts was $146 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of august 3, 2014.
we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the vanguard institutional index, and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the standard & poor's 500 index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index; or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $17 million at august 2, 2015, and $25 million at august 3, 2014. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in april 2016, was 0.80% at august 2, 2015. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard & poor's 500 index was $24 million at august 2, 2015, and $22 million at august 3, 2014. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2016, was 0.79% at august 2, 2015. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was $8 million at august 2, 2015, and $9 million at august 3, 2014. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2016, was 0.71% at august 2, 2015. the fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at august 2, 2015, and a $3 million loss at august 3, 2014.
our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.
significant accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:
trade and consumer promotion programs - we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. the mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. however, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
valuation of long-lived assets - fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow
29
analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the "implied" fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
as of august 2, 2015, the carrying value of goodwill was $2,344 million. recent acquisitions include garden fresh gourmet on june 29, 2015, kelsen in 2014, and plum and bolthouse farms in 2013. as of august 2, 2015, goodwill related to the acquisitions was as follows: garden fresh gourmet - $116 million, kelsen - $115 million, plum - $128 million and bolthouse farms - $692 million. as of the 2015 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value, excluding the recent acquisitions. holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, excluding the recent acquisitions, to be in excess of the fair value. because the garden fresh gourmet acquisition closed on june 29, 2015, the carrying value represents fair value. with respect to the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 7% and as a result, holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value. the fair value was based on significant management assumptions. if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
as of august 2, 2015, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $960 million. as of august 2, 2015, trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 through 2015 were as follows: garden fresh gourmet - $38 million, kelsen - $120 million, plum - $115 million and bolthouse farms - $383 million. excluding the garden fresh gourmet trademark acquired on june 29, 2015, holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks, and result in an impairment charge of approximately $20 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $6 million on minor trademarks used in the global baking and snacking segment. the trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded an impairment charge of $360 million on goodwill and $36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe. the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. on october 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our european simple meals business. we have reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations.
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as capital markets. the actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
pension and postretirement benefits - we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected
30
return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, perform the required calculations to determine expense. actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.
the discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. in establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. in addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. the value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. if the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year.
net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $80 million in 2015, $109 million in 2014 and $130 million in 2013.
significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:
2015                                            2014         2013
pension discount rate for benefit obligations   4.19%        4.33%        4.82%
expected return on plan assets          7.35%        7.62%        7.62%
postretirement discount rate for obligations           4.00%        4.00%        4.50%
initial health care trend rate          7.75%        8.25%        8.25%
ultimate health care trend rate         4.50%        4.50%        4.50%
estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $14 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $11 million. a one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million.
no contributions were made to u.s. pension plans in 2015. we contributed $35 million and $75 million, respectively, to u.s. pension plans in 2014 and 2013. contributions to non-u.s. plans were $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014 and 2013. we do not expect to contribute to the u.s. pension plans in 2016. contributions to non-u.s. plans are expected to be approximately $5 million in 2016.

income taxes - the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

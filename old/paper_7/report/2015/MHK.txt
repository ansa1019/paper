item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the second quarter of 2015, the company realigned its reportable segments to reflect how the company's results will be reported by management. the company has reorganized its business into three segments: global ceramic, flooring north america ("flooring na") and flooring rest of the world ("flooring row"). in order to leverage its relationships and distribution capabilities, the company organized its carpet, wood, laminate, luxury vinyl tile ("lvt") and vinyl operations by geography into the flooring na segment and flooring row segment. the company did not make any changes to the global ceramic segment. previously reported segment results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
this new segment structure is consistent with the strategic objective that management now applies to manage the growth and profitability of the company's business. the global ceramic segment includes all worldwide tile and natural stone operations. the flooring na segment includes north american operations in all product categories except tile and natural stone. the new segment combines the former carpet segment with the north american operations of the former laminate and wood segment and the north american operations of the company's newly acquired lvt and vinyl flooring businesses. the flooring row segment includes operations outside of north america in all product categories except tile and natural stone. the new segment combines the european and rest of the world operations of the former laminate and wood segment and the european and rest of the world operations of the company's newly acquired lvt and vinyl flooring businesses.
the global ceramic segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and other products, which it distributes primarily in north america, europe and russia through its network of regional distribution centers and company-operated service centers using company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. the segment's product lines are sold through company-operated service centers, independent distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers and contractors. the flooring na segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood, laminate and vinyl products, including lvt, which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. the segment's product lines are sold through various selling channels, including independent floor covering retailers, distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. the flooring row segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, hardwood flooring, roofing elements, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard ("mdf"), chipboards, other wood products and vinyl products, including lvt, which it distributes primarily in europe and russia through various selling channels, which include retailers, independent distributors and home centers.
net earnings attributable to the company were $615.3 million, or diluted eps of $8.31 for 2015 compared to net earnings attributable to the company of $532.0 million, or diluted eps of $7.25 for 2014. the increase in eps was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes, savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs, lower taxes due to the geographic dispersion of earnings, and lower interest expense, partially offset by a charge of approximately $122.5 million related to the settlement and defense of the polyurethane foam litigation, the net impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel and marketing, and the unfavorable net impact of price and product mix.
a majority of the company's sales and long-lived assets are located in the united states and europe. the company expects continued strong performance in the united states market as residential housing starts and remodeling continue to rebound. in europe, the company's operations improved on a local basis despite a challenging macro-economic environment. the company also has operations in mexico and russia where the company is growing market share, especially in its ceramic tile product lines. while the company is performing well in the local markets where it operates, the company expects that a strong u.s. dollar will continue to impact the translation of its foreign operating results.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company generated $911.9 million of cash from operating activities. as of december 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $81.7 million, of which $20.5 million was in the united states and $61.2 million was in foreign countries.

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. in reaching such decisions, the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis
31
index to financial statements of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.
•   accounts receivable and revenue recognition. revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. a 10% change in the company's allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method ("fifo"). costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required. a 10% change in the company's reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015.
•   acquisition accounting. the fair value of the consideration we pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill. the accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. the assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. see note 2-acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.
•   goodwill and other intangibles. goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. the company has identified global ceramic, flooring na and flooring row as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital ("wacc"), and comparable company market multiples. when developing these key judgments and assumptions, the company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. however, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectations regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be
32
index to financial statements impacted. generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 35% or a more than 28% increase in wacc or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows. the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.
the company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. if such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.
the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for 2015.
•   income taxes. the company's effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating the company's tax positions. deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. the company had valuation allowances of $287.6 million in 2015, $300.5 million in 2014 and $375.9 million in 2013. for further information regarding the company's valuation allowances, see note 13-income taxes.
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") fasb accounting standards codification topic ("asc") 740-10. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2015, the company has $51.0 million accrued for uncertain tax positions. for further information regarding the company's uncertain tax positions, see note 13-income taxes.
•   environmental and legal accruals. environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the company's consolidated financial statements. in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the company consults with its internal
33
index to financial statements experts. the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1(v), "summary of significant accounting policies", of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.
impact of inflation inflation affects the company's manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. the company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the company's production processes. although the company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the company's ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the company's products. there have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. in the past, the company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.
seasonality the company is a calendar year-end company. with respect to its flooring na and global ceramic segments, its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter. the second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments. these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. the flooring row segment's second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and fourth quarter and a weaker third quarter.

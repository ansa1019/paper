2015 compared to 2014
net sales growth of 118.3% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was primarily as a result of the acquisition of the enterprise business and higher north america sales, offset partially by $149 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, net of hedges. the enterprise business, including purchase accounting adjustments, contributed $1,888 million or 95.4% of the increase in total net sales, increased gross profit by $808 million or 93.4%, and increased recurring operating expenses by $830 million or 95.9%, and non-recurring operating expenses by $42 million or 81.3%. included within the total recurring operating expenses was an increase of $197 million of amortization expense as a result of intangibles acquired. within non-recurring operating expenses were increases of $18 million of integration and acquisition costs as a result of it costs of transitioning and exiting the motorola platforms and $24 million of exit and restructuring costs as a result of integrating acquired facilities and related employees.

net sales, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the enterprise business, increased by $91 million or 7.7% in 2015 versus 2014. the unfavorable impact of foreign currency reduced sales by $70 million. this increase is primarily due to sales growth in the north america and asia-pacific regions, specifically higher volumes of barcode printers and location solutions. latin america sales were lower driven by a weak macro-economic environment. consolidated net sales, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, grew 12.5%, on a constant currency basis.
gross margin as a percent of sales, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, was 50.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 50.0% in the comparable year ended december 31, 2014. this increase in margins reflects the favorable impact of higher unit sales within the north america and asia-pacific regions and lower product costs for both hardware and supplies, offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency effects, net of hedges.
operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, were $415 million compared to $370 million in the prior year. included in the increase were exit and restructuring costs within legacy zebra of $10 million related to organizational redesign. as a percentage of sales, operating expenses, excluding the enterprise business, were 32.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 31.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to additional investments made to support business growth in the sales, research and development, and administrative functions, and exit and restructuring costs.
operating income for the year ended december 31, 2015, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, increased $12 million or 5.2% compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily due to higher sales and gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses and the unfavorable foreign currency effects, net of hedges.

29
forward interest rate swap gains in 2015 included in interest expense compared to a $5 million loss in 2014 primarily due to the changes in the market interest rates.
in 2015, the company recognized a tax benefit of $22 million compared to a tax benefit of $15 million for 2014. the company's effective tax rates were 12.2% and (95.0)% as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to pre-tax losses in the united states and corporate structure realignment initiatives in various non-us jurisdictions.

2014 compared to 2013
net sales growth of 60.9% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily a result of the acquisition of the enterprise business and higher sales in all regions and product categories. the enterprise business contributed $476 million or 75.3% of the increase in total net sales, increased gross profit by $180 million or 65.7%, increased recurring operating expenses by $185 million or 83.1%, and non-recurring operating expenses by $135 million or 108.5%. included within the total recurring operating expenses were $47 million of amortization expense as a result of the acquisition. included within non-recurring operating expenses were $127 million of acquisition related costs also as a result of the acquisition and $6 million of exit and restructuring costs related to organizational redesign.

gross margin as a percent of sales, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, was 50.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 48.5% in the comparable year ended december 31, 2013. the improvement in gross margin reflected the favorable impact of higher sales, as well as product cost reductions on printers and supplies, and the december 2013 acquisition of hart systems llc. the gross profit increase in 2014 versus 2013 was primarily due to the higher sales, improved gross margin percentage, and the december 2013 acquisition of hart systems llc.
operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, were $369 million compared to $343 million in the prior year. as a percentage of sales, operating expenses, excluding the enterprise business, were 31.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 33.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to a higher rate of sales growth than the rate of increase in expenses.
operating income for the year ended december 31, 2014, excluding the effect of the enterprise business, increased $68 million or 42.0% compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily due to higher sales and gross margin percentage improvement, which resulted in a gross profit increase of $94 million. this was partially offset by higher operating expenses to support business growth.
the company recognized a foreign exchange loss of $9 million for 2014 as a result of changes in the value of non-us dollar assets and liabilities that were not hedged during the period. zebra did not hedge the enterprise monetary assets until the second quarter of 2015.

in 2014, the company recognized a tax benefit of $15 million compared to tax expense of $30 million for 2013. the company's effective tax rates were (95)% and 18.1% as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the 2014
30
rate benefit is primarily driven by foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and a domestic pre-tax loss, which is attributable to third-party interest expense and acquisition expenses.

net sales for 2015 increased $91 million or 7.7% compared to 2014. net sales growth compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis was $149 million or 12.5%. this reflects higher net sales for the north america and asia-pacific regions. net sales in emea were essentially unchanged while latin america net sales were lower. on a constant currency basis, net sales in emea increased 14% compared to 2014. the increase in net sales for the north america region was primarily due to higher volume of sales related to barcode printers and location solutions. the higher level of net sales for emea and asia-pacific regions reflected increased volumes of barcode printers. the decrease in net sales in the latin america region was primarily driven by a weak macro-economic environment.
gross margin as a percentage of sales was 50.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 50.0% for 2014. this increase in margins reflects the favorable impact of higher unit sales and lower product costs for both hardware and supplies, offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency effects, net of hedges.
operating income for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased 8.4% as a result of higher sales and gross profit partially offset by increases in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects, net of hedges. operating expenses increased compared to the prior year primarily to support business growth.
2014 compared to 2013
net sales for 2014 increased 15.1% compared to 2013. this increase is a result of growth across all regions and across all product categories, with notable increases in supplies and service contracts, and sales of tabletop, desktop, and mobile printers. increased services and software revenue is attributable to both organic growth and the december 2013 acquisition of hart systems llc, which increased sales by $24 million. movement in foreign currency, net of hedges, increased sales growth by $10 million.
gross margin for 2014 of 50.0% versus 48.5% for 2013, reflects the favorable impact of higher sales, as well as lower product costs, including the improved absorption of fixed costs and lower freight costs, and revenue associated with the december 2013 acquisition of hart systems llc. favorable movements in foreign currency, net of hedges, increased gross profit by $7 million.
operating income for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 33.3% from the prior year. this is the result of 15.1% sales growth and gross margin improvement of 150 basis points. this resulted in a gross profit improvement of $94 million, or 18.7%. this was partially offset by increases in operating expenses to support business growth.

2015 compared to 2014
on october 27, 2014, the company acquired enterprise, an industry leader in mobile computing and data capture technologies and services, therefore 2014 only includes results since the acquisition date.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net sales for enterprise were $2.4 billion compared to $482 million in 2014, which includes net sales only for the period following the acquisition. mobile computing, data capture, and repair services generated the majority of enterprise net sales for the year in 2015 and 2014. the regions which accounted for the majority of 2015 and 2014 enterprise net sales included north america and emea. sales in the fourth quarter were $635 million, up 4.8% compared to the third quarter due to higher net sales in emea.
gross profit margin for the full year 2015 was 42.4%. gross margin of 44.5% in 2014 reflects only the period following the acquisition on october 27, 2014. gross margin in the fourth quarter was 42.4%, comparable to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting higher gross margin in services offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects.
enterprise's operating expenses for 2015 were $774 million and operating income for 2015 was $236 million. operating expenses in the fourth quarter were flat compared to the third quarter; however the fourth quarter was 30.8% of sales compared to 31.9% in the third quarter of 2015 due to the improved operating leverage.
retail solutions group goodwill the retail solutions group reporting unit had total goodwill of $59 million as of december 31, 2015. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we finalized the determination of estimated fair value of the retail solutions group reporting unit as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2015. the determination of fair value and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within the retail solutions group reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; a control premium appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the retail solutions group reporting unit competes; a discount rate; a terminal growth rate; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures. the estimate of fair value indicated that the fair value of the retail solutions group reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12% as of the valuation date. although we believe our estimate of fair value is reasonable, actual financial results could differ from that estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate.
critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these principles require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions. we believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable, based upon the information available at that time.
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k/a.

liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition in october 2014, we incurred indebtedness totaling $3.25 billion. as of december 31, 2015, we had long-term debt totaling $3.09 billion. we did not have any borrowings against our revolving credit facility with $247 million available ($250 million less $3 million of outstanding letters of credit). see note 14 long-term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k/a for further details and under financing activities below. the primary factors that influence our liquidity include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of our revenues, cash collections from our customers, capital expenditures, repatriation of foreign cash and investments, and acquisitions of third-parties. management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions):

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following:
2015 vs. 2014
cash flows from operations decreased $138 million during 2015 to $110 million. while an increase in net loss of $190 million netted against an increase in non-cash operating items of $161 million yielded a decrease in cash flow from operations of $29 million, the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to changes in certain assets and liabilities of $109 million during 2015. these changes consisted primarily of a decrease in cash inflows related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $252 million offset by a $72 million decrease in cash outflows for accounts receivable and a $52 million increase in cash inflows for income taxes payable.
net cash used in investing activities during 2015 included additional consideration of $51 million paid to msi in relation to the opening cash balance and working capital adjustments. in addition, there were capital expenditures of $122 million in 2015 compared to $39 million in 2014. the increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 consisted primarily of investments in it infrastructure, software applications, facilities, engineering, development, test equipment, and production and tooling equipment. reflecting the effect of the acquisition on the company's capital structure, net cash used for investing activities during 2014 included $3.4 billion paid to msi and purchases of marketable securities of $651 million offset by $644 million and $336 million of proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments in marketable securities, respectively.
net cash used in financing activities during 2015 consisted primarily of principal repayments of $165 million under the term loan compared to proceeds of $3.2 billion from the issuance of long-term debt to fund the acquisition during 2014. additionally, proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases ("espp") were $17 million this year compared to $26 million in 2014 reflecting decreased option exercises and espp purchases. the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were $13 million in 2015 compared to $5 million in 2014 reflecting increased restricted stock trading activity.
2014 vs. 2013
cash flows from operations increased $54 million during 2014 to $248 million. while a decrease in net income of $102 million netted against an increase in non-cash operating items of $13 million yielded a decrease in cash flow from operations of $89 million, the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in certain assets and liabilities of $143 million during 2014. these changes consisted primarily of an increase in cash inflows of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $213 million offset by a $63 million increase in cash outflows related to accounts receivable.
net cash used in investing activities during 2014 included $3.4 billion paid to msi in the acquisition and purchases of marketable securities of $651 million offset by $644 million and $336 million of proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments in marketable securities respectively. during 2013, net cash used in investing activities included $95 million paid for the acquisition of hart systems llc and $410 million for the purchase of marketable securities offset by $337 million and $49 million of proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments in marketable securities, respectively.

million in 2014 compared to $23 million in 2013 reflecting increased option exercises and espp purchases. the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were $5 million in 2014 compared to $8 million in 2013 reflecting decreased restricted stock trading activity.
effect of exchange rates on cash certain assets on the consolidated balance sheet are denominated in foreign currency and, as such, include the effects of foreign currency translation. the effect of exchange rate changes on cash during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were $16 million loss and $2 million gain, respectively.
the following table shows our level of indebtedness and other information as of december 31, 2015 (in millions):

private offering on october 15, 2014, the company completed a private offering of $1.05 billion in 7.25% senior notes due october 15, 2022. interest on the senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year.
the indenture covering the senior notes contains certain covenants limiting among other things the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the indenture, to; (i) incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; (ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain other restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of restricted subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates; or (ix) effect a consolidation or merger. on december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with the covenants.
credit facilities on october 27, 2014, the company entered into a credit agreement, which provides for a term loan of $2.2 billion ("term loan") and a revolving credit facility of $250 million ("revolving credit facility"). borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of 4.75%. as of december 31 2015, the term loan interest rate was 4.75%. interest payments are payable quarterly. the october 2012 revolving credit agreement for $250 million with a syndicate of banks was terminated upon execution of this credit agreement. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. see note 14 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k/a for further details.
the credit agreement requires the company to prepay the term loan and revolving credit facility, under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement. also, the company may voluntarily prepay its obligations under the term loan at any time in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. the company has made such optional principal prepayments of $165 million in 2015. in february 2016, the company made additional optional principal prepayments of $80 million. unless satisfied by further optional prepayments, the company is required to make a scheduled principal payment of $1.99 billion due on october 27, 2021.
the revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. the amount (including letters of credit) shall not exceed $250 million. as of december 31, 2015, the company had established letters of credit totaling $3 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to $247 million. the revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on october 27, 2019.
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 2.25% to 2.75% depending on the company's consolidated total secured net leverage ratio, which is evaluated on a quarterly basis. interest payments are payable quarterly. as of december 31 2015, the company did not have any borrowings against the revolving credit facility.
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants limiting among other things, the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the credit agreement, to: (i) incur indebtedness, make guarantees or issue certain equity securities; (ii) pay dividends on its capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire its capital stock; (iii) make certain investments, loans and acquisitions; (iv) sell certain assets or issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; (v) create liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions; (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (viii) alter the business it conducts; (ix) amend, prepay, redeem
34
or purchase subordinated debt; and (x) enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. the revolving credit facility also requires the company to comply with a financial covenant consisting of a quarterly maximum consolidated total secured net leverage ratio, (as defined in the credit agreement). this test is only required to be performed at the end of the fiscal quarter and when 20% of the commitments under the revolving credit facility have been drawn and remain outstanding.
the term loan and obligations under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the company's assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
certain domestic subsidiaries of the company (the "guarantor subsidiaries") guarantee the notes, the term loan and the revolving credit facility on a senior basis: for the year ended december 31, 2015, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for 44% of our total revenue and (b) held 24% or $1.3 billion of our total assets and approximately 10% or $430 million of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.
on december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all covenants.
historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2016. we believe that our existing cash and investments, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating, capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months.
as of december 31, 2015, the company's cash position of $192 million included foreign cash and investments of $166 million.
management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements.

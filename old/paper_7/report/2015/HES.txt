item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hess corporation is a global exploration and production (e&p) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states (u.s.), denmark, equatorial guinea, the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda), malaysia, and norway.  the bakken midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the bakken shale play of north dakota.
transformation to a pure play e&p company in 2013, we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play e&p company.  these initiatives represented the culmination of a multi-year strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets, exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities, and execute a smaller, more targeted exploration program.  this transformation was completed in 2015.
during 2013 through 2015, the corporation sold mature or lower margin e&p assets in algeria, azerbaijan, indonesia, russia, thailand, the united kingdom (uk) north sea, and certain interests onshore in the u.s.  in addition, the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporation's marketing and refining (m&r) business, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading, nj facility.  hovensa l.l.c. (hovensa), a 50/50 joint venture between the corporation's subsidiary, hess oil virgin islands corp. (hovic), and petroleos de venezuela s.a. (pdvsa), had previously shut down its u.s. virgin islands refinery in 2012.  hovensa filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states district court of the virgin islands in september 2015.    in january 2016, limetree bay terminals, llc (limetree) purchased the terminal and refinery assets of the st. croix facility and hovensa will conduct an orderly wind-down of its remaining activities.  see item 3. legal proceedings.
response to low oil prices in 2015, we realized an adjusted net loss of $1,113 million and incurred a net operating cash flow deficit (cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities) of $2,225 million based on average 2015 west texas intermediate (wti) oil prices of $48.80 per barrel (brent - $53.64 per barrel).  in response to the decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014, we conducted an extensive company-wide review of our cost base and engaged with our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce costs during 2015.  as a result of these cost reduction efforts, we decreased e&p capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million to $4.0 billion, and cash operating costs by approximately $300 million versus our 2015 plan.
at december 31, 2015, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.4 billion.  oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) compared with 375,000 boepd in 2015, and we have reduced our 2016 e&p capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015.  capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately $340 million in 2016.  forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015, and as a result, we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2016.  in february 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock, par value $1 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of convertible preferred stock, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion.  we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand.  due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales.  see note 23, subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
consolidated results net loss was $3,056 million in 2015 compared with net income in the prior two years (2014: $2,317 million; 2013: $5,052 million).  excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 28, adjusted net loss was $1,113 million in 2015
24
compared with adjusted net income in the prior two years (2014: $1,308 million; 2013: $1,892 million).  annual production averaged 375,000 boepd (2014: 329,000 boepd; 2013: 336,000 boepd) and is expected to average between 330,000 boepd and 350,000 boepd in 2016 excluding any contribution from libya.  total proved reserves were 1,086 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), 1,431 million boe, and 1,437 million boe at december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at december 31, 2015, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves.
significant 2015 activities the following is an update of significant e&p activities for 2015:
producing e&p assets:
·   in north dakota, net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 112,000 boepd (2014: 83,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year primarily due to ongoing field development. during 2015, we operated an average of 8.5 rigs, drilled 182 wells, completed 212 wells, and brought on production 219 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,201 at december 31, 2015. drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.8 million in 2015, down 21% from 2014. in 2016, we plan to operate an average of two rigs to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 wells on production while reducing capital expenditures to $425 million, down from $1.3 billion in 2015. bakken production is forecast to average between 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd in 2016.

·   at the valhall field in norway, net production averaged 33,000 boepd (2014: 31,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells in the current period. during 2015, the operator, bp, drilled one well and completed three wells, and continued to execute a multi-year well abandonment program. production from the valhall field is forecast to average approximately 30,000 boepd in 2016, with the decrease from 2015 reflecting reduced drilling activity.

·   at block a‐18 of the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda), the operator, carigali hess operating company, continued drilling production wells and progressed its booster compression project that is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016. production averaged 42,000 boepd (2014: 42,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia. production from the jda is forecast to average approximately 35,000 boepd in 2016 due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with the booster compression project.

·   at the hess operated tubular bells field, we achieved our first full year of production following first oil in late 2014. in the second half of 2015 a subsurface safety valve stuck in the closed position at one well and two other wells experienced wellbore skin effects that reduced production rates. as a result, full-year 2015 production from tubular bells was restricted to 19,000 boepd and we estimate full-year 2016 net production to be approximately 20,000 boepd to 25,000 boepd. in 2016, we intend to complete one water injector well, drill one production well, perform two wellbore stimulations, and complete a workover on a third well to open the stuck subsurface safety valve.

·   in the north malay basin (nmb), in 2015 net production from the early production system averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day (2014: 43 million cubic feet per day). in 2015, we also progressed fabrication and installation of the central processing platform and commenced development drilling activities associated with the full-field development project. this project is on schedule to be completed in 2017, from which production is forecast to average approximately 165 million cubic feet per day.

·   at the south arne field, offshore denmark, we continued drilling operations in 2015 and expect to complete drilling of a previously sanctioned eleven well multi-year program in the first quarter of 2016. net production is forecast to average approximately between 10,000 boepd and 15,000 boepd in 2016 compared with 13,000 boepd in 2015.

·   in the utica shale, 24 wells were drilled, 32 wells were completed and 32 wells were brought into production in 2015. net production increased to approximately 24,000 boepd in 2015. in the third quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately $120 million. in 2016, we and our joint venture partner plan to suspend drilling activities, but will bring into production 14 wells. net production is expected to average between 20,000 boepd and 25,000 boepd in 2016.

·   in equatorial guinea, we deferred the remaining portion of an infill drilling program at the okume field to reduce spend and allow time to evaluate recently acquired 4d seismic. net production in 2016 is expected to average between 30,000 boepd and 35,000 boepd compared with net production in 2015 of 43,000 boepd.

·   in algeria, production averaged 10,000 boepd for the fourth quarter of 2015. we sold our interests in the country on december 31, 2015.

25
·   in libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability since august 2013. at the waha fields (hess 8%), the operator shut-in production for 2015 and force majeure declared by the national oil company of libya remains in effect.

other e&p assets:
·   at the stampede development project in the gulf of mexico, we expect to commence drilling of our first production well in the first quarter of 2016. construction of production facilities and subsea equipment is underway with first production from the field targeted in 2018 at an expected net rate of 15,000 boepd.

·   in ghana, we, along with our co-owners, continued development planning and subsurface evaluation in 2015. the government of côte d'ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of ghana, which includes a portion of our deepwater tano/cape three points license. we are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license. the international tribunal for law of the sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017. under terms of our license, the deadline to declare commerciality for the pecan field, which would be the primary development hub for the block, is in march 2016, and the deadline to submit a plan of development is in september 2016. we have requested an extension of the submission deadline for a plan of development for the pecan field, and will continue to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute. in 2015, we expensed previously capitalized gas wells that have not sufficiently progressed appraisal negotiations with the regulator. see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 5, property, plant and equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

·   at the equus project on block wa-390-p in the offshore carnarvon basin of australia, in 2015 we initiated joint front-end engineering studies with a potential third-party liquefaction partner following the execution of a non-binding letter of intent with the same third-party liquefaction partner in 2014. in 2015, we commenced discussions with potential long-term purchasers of liquefied natural gas, and in 2016 we plan to drill a commitment well on block wa-474-p which is adjacent to block wa-390-p. we also wrote-off three previously capitalized wells that we determined will not be included in the current development concept. see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 5, property, plant and equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

·   in guyana at the stabroek block (hess 30%), the operator, esso exploration and production guyana limited, announced a significant oil discovery at the liza-1 well in the second quarter of 2015. the operator plans to drill two appraisal wells, including one sidetrack with a production test, and two exploration wells in 2016. a new 17,000 square kilometer 3d seismic shoot is near completion and the operator, along with its partners, continues to evaluate the resource potential of the block.

·   at the sicily prospect (hess 25%), in the keathley canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico, the operator successfully completed drilling and logging activities in 2015 of its initial exploration well. the discovery well was drilled to a depth of 30,214 feet and is being evaluated. drilling of an appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery commenced in december 2015.

·   at the melmar prospect in the alaminos canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico (hess 35%), which we entered into during 2015, the operator, conocophillips, commenced exploration drilling in december 2015.

·   in the kurdistan region of iraq (hess 64%), we and our partner agreed to relinquish the dinarta block, and to exit operations in the region based on well results in 2015.

the following is an update of significant bakken midstream activities during 2015:
·   we completed the sale of a 50% interest in our bakken midstream business to global infrastructure partners (gip) for cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion and formed a joint venture with gip. the joint venture has filed a form s-1 with the securities and exchange commission in preparation for an initial public offering of hess midstream partners lp limited partnership units to the public. the joint venture expects to initiate the offering when market conditions for the sale of limited partnership units become more favorable.

·   we commenced the construction of facilities and the reconfiguration of pipelines in mckenzie and williams counties that are expected to increase throughput capacity for crude oil and natural gas originating from south of the missouri river for transporting north to our natural gas processing and crude oil and natural gas liquids logistics assets in tioga and ramberg. we currently expect these projects to be fully in service in 2017.

in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis.  management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after‐tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.  management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount.  after-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

selling prices: average realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 48% lower in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the declines in brent and wti crude oil prices that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014.  in addition, realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined by 66% and 31%, respectively, in 2015 compared to the prior year.  in total, lower realized selling prices reduced 2015 financial results by approximately $2.5 billion after income taxes compared with 2014.  our average selling prices were as follows:

(a)   reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. in addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. see the average selling prices on page 30.

we expect total net production to average between 330,000 boepd and 350,000 boepd in 2016, excluding any contribution from libya.  production variances related to 2015, 2014 and 2013 can be summarized as follows:
united states: onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play, while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale.  offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field, which came online in november 2014, was offset primarily by lower production from the llano, conger and shenzi fields.  crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013, a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play, higher production resulting from drilling in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico.
europe:  crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in the current year.  crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the april 2013 sale of our russian subsidiary, partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the
31
valhall field in norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013.  higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field.
africa:  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, due to libyan production being shut-in.  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013, following civil unrest in the country.  net production averaged 4,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in 2014 and 13,000 bopd in 2013.  in december 2014 the national oil company of libya declared force majeure with respect to the waha concession and production is currently shut-in.
asia and other:  natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda) as a result of higher facility uptime.  crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, as a result of the divestiture of our interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and our interest in the azeri-chirag-guneshli (acg) fields, azerbaijan in march 2013.  natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the divestiture of our remaining interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014 and lower production from the jda, which was partially offset by a full year of production from the north malay basin.
sales volumes:  our worldwide sales volumes were as follows:

(a)   reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. in addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. see the average selling prices on page 30.

cost of products sold:  cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other third-parties, as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment starting in 2014.  the decrease in cost of products sold in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices.  cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in our operated wells being offset by lower purchases from third-parties.
cash operating costs:  cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and e&p general and administrative expenses, decreased by $188 million in 2015 compared with the prior year (2014: $315 million decrease versus 2013).  the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken, which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014.  the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of our remaining indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and our interests in russia in april 2013, as well as lower employee costs.
bakken midstream tariffs: tariffs for 2015 primarily reflect higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project.  the tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014.
depreciation, depletion and amortization:  depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) costs increased by $712 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflecting higher production volumes from the bakken, tubular bells and utica fields, which had higher dd&a rates per barrel than the portfolio average.  higher production in 2014 from these fields, as well as the valhall field and north malay basin, were the primarily drivers for the increase in dd&a costs in 2014 compared to 2013.

unit costs:  unit cost per boe information is based on total e&p production volumes and exclude items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below.  actual and forecast unit costs are as follows:

(a)   forecasted amounts assume no contribution from libya.

(b)   bakken midstream tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014. in 2013, bakken midstream earned revenues at the tioga gas plant by purchasing unprocessed natural gas from our e&amp;p business and third-parties, processing those hydrocarbons and selling them back to our e&amp;p business or third-party customers based on a percentage of proceeds.

exploration expenses:  exploration expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses.  for 2016, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $260 million to $280 million.
income taxes:  excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the effective income tax rates for e&p operations amounted to a benefit of 46% in 2015 (2014: 41% charge; 2013: 42% charge).  the tax benefit in 2015 resulted from operating losses, while the increased effective rate from 2014 is due to a greater proportion of results attributable to higher tax jurisdictions.  the decline in the effective tax rate from 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the impact of shut‐in production in libya from the third quarter of 2013.  based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2016 and, as a result, the e&p effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 41% to 45% excluding libyan operations.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  reported e&p earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

total revenues and non-operating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the tioga gas plant.  in the fourth quarter of 2013, the tioga gas plant was shut down for a large‐scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project, during which a new cryogenic processing train was installed and processing capacity was increased to 250 mmcfd from 120 mmcfd.  the tioga gas plant's expanded operations commenced in late march 2014.  total revenues and non-operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 as a result of tariff arrangements becoming effective in 2014.  these arrangements allow for bakken midstream operating segment to charge a fee based tariff to exploration and production for certain midstream services provided.  prior to 2014, when providing natural gas processing services, our bakken midstream operating segment purchased unprocessed natural gas and provided processing services pursuant to percentage-of-proceeds contracts whereby it retained a portion of the sales proceeds received from both our e&p operating segment and third-party customers.  pursuant to these contracts, the bakken midstream operating segment also charged certain additional fees.  the remaining proceeds were remitted back to suppliers.  in addition, total revenues and non-operating income for 2014 also

benefited from the large‐scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project at the tioga gas plant which resulted in a shut-down of the plant from november 2013 to march 2014.
operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third‐party operating and maintenance expense.  operating costs and expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a reduction in activity following the shutdown of the tioga gas plant between november 2013 and march 2014.  depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to a full year's usage of the tioga gas plant in 2015.  dd&a expenses were higher in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the commencement of depreciation of the tioga gas plant expansion expenditures upon restart of operations in late march 2014.
for 2016, we estimate net income attributable to hess corporation from the bakken midstream segment, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.

corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pre-tax gain of $13 million ($8 million after income taxes) related to the disposition of our 50% interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in newark, new jersey.  excluding the gain, 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses.  corporate expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower employee related costs, contract labor and professional fees.  in 2016 after-tax corporate expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million.
interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings.  capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the tubular bells field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014.  interest expense, net was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower average outstanding debt, lower letter of credit fees and higher capitalized interest.  in 2016 after-tax interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  in 2015 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to hovensa llc and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution.  see item 3. legal proceedings.  in 2015, we also incurred exit costs of $6 million ($4 million after income taxes) and recorded a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes) from the sale of land.  in 2014 we recorded pre-tax charges of $84 million ($52 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of our investment in the bayonne energy center to fair value,  $19 million ($12 million after income taxes) for net pre‐tax severance charges and $15 million ($10 million after income taxes) for exit related costs.  in 2013 we recorded pre‐tax charges of $21 million ($13 million after income taxes) for severance charges related to our transformation into a pure play e&p company and $19 million ($13 million after income taxes) for exit related costs, including costs for cessation of leased office space.
discontinued operations discontinued operations attributable to hess corporation were a net loss of $48 million in 2015 compared to net income of $625 million in 2014 and $1,192 million in 2013.  discontinued operations included ownership of an energy trading partnership through february 2015, retail marketing through september 2014, terminals through december 2013, energy marketing through november 2013 and port reading refining activities through the date it was permanently shut down in february 2013.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  in september 2014, we completed the sale of our retail business for cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion.  this transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $954 million ($602
36
million after income taxes).  during 2014, we recorded pre-tax gains of $275 million ($171 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of last-in, first-out (lifo) inventories associated with the divested downstream operations.  in addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $308 million ($202 million after income taxes) in 2014 for impairments, environmental matters, severance and exit related activities associated with the divestiture of downstream operations.  we also recognized in 2014 a pre-tax charge of $115 million ($72 million after income taxes) related to the termination of lease contracts and the purchase of 180 retail gasoline stations in preparation for the sale of the retail operations.  in january 2014, we acquired our partners' 56% interest in wilcohess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million and the settlement of liabilities.  in connection with this business combination, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $39 million ($24 million after income taxes) to remeasure the carrying value of our original 44% equity interest in wilcohess to fair value.  the assets and liabilities acquired from wilcohess were included in the sale of the retail business in september 2014.  in december 2013, we sold our u.s. east coast terminal network, st. lucia terminal and related businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion.  the transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $739 million ($531 million after income taxes).  in november 2013, we sold our energy marketing business for cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $761 million ($464 million after income taxes).  in addition, we recognized pre-tax gains of $678 million ($414 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of lifo inventories as a result of ceasing refining operations and the sales of our energy marketing and terminals businesses.  during 2013, we also incurred $131 million ($80 million after income taxes) of net employee severance charges and $230 million ($154 million after income taxes) of other exit costs, including environmental, legal and professional fees.  as a result of the permanent shutdown of the port reading refining facility, we recorded charges of $82 million ($49 million after income taxes) for shutdown related costs and $80 million ($51 million after income taxes) for asset impairments.

operating activities:  net cash provided by operating activities declined to $1,981 million in 2015 (2014: $4,457 million), primarily reflecting the decline in benchmark crude oil prices.  net cash provided by operating activities declined to $4,457 million in 2014 (2013: $5,098 million), reflecting the impact of changes in working capital, lower operating earnings primarily as a result of asset sales, and the decline in benchmark crude oil prices.
investing activities:  the decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (the bakken, the utica, norway and equatorial guinea), reduced development expenditures at tubular bells and the jda, and lower exploratory drilling activity (ghana and kurdistan).  these reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at stampede in the gulf of mexico and exploration drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and guyana, and full field development at north malay basin.
the decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2014, as compared with 2013, is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the bakken, reflecting lower well costs, and completion of the tioga gas plant expansion project.
total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to $50 million in 2015 (2014: $2,978 million; 2013: $4,458 million).  in 2014, we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the utica shale play, our assets in thailand, the pangkah field, offshore indonesia, and our interests in two power plant joint ventures.  completed sales in 2013 included our interests in the beryl, acg, eagle ford and natuna a fields, and our russian subsidiary, samara-nafta.
in 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business.  in addition, we acquired in january 2014, our partners' 56% interest in wilcohess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million.  in june 2014, we incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations.  both of these transactions were undertaken in connection with our divestiture of our retail business.  net cash provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations for 2013 includes proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the sales of our energy marketing operations and our u.s. east coast terminal network, st. lucia terminal and related businesses.
financing activities:  during 2015, we received net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion from the sale of a  50% interest in our bakken midstream business.  upon formation of the joint venture, hip issued $600 million of debt under a term loan a facility.  the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners.  during 2014, we issued $600 million ($598 million net of discount) of unsecured, fixed rate notes and repaid $590 million of debt, including $250 million of unsecured, fixed rate notes, $74 million assumed in the acquisition of wilcohess, and $249 million for the payment of various lease obligations primarily related to the retirement of our retail gasoline station leases.  in 2013, we repaid $2,348 million, net under available credit facilities and repaid $136 million of other debt.  the net repayments under the
38
credit facilities consisted of $990 million on our short‐term credit facilities, $758 million on our syndicated revolving credit facility and $600 million on our asset backed credit facility.
in 2015, we paid $142 million for the purchase and settlement of common shares under our $6.5 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan (2014: $3,715 million; 2013: $1,493 million).  total common stock dividends paid were $287 million in 2015 (2014: $303 million; 2013: $235 million).  we received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $12 million in 2015 (2014: $182 million; 2013: $128 million).
future capital requirements and resources at december 31, 2015, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including $0.4 billion held outside of the u.s. which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a u.s. cash tax liability, and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.4 billion.  oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 boepd compared with 375,000 boepd in 2015, and we have reduced our 2016 e&p capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015.  capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately $340 million in 2016.  forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015, and as a result, we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2016.  in february 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock, par value $1, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of convertible preferred stock, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion.  we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand.  due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales.  see note 23, subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

we had $113 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2015 (2014: $397 million), which in 2015 primarily relate to our international operations.  see also note 22, financial risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in january 2015, we entered into a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in january 2020.  the new facility, which replaced a $4 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in april 2016, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit.  based on our credit rating as of december 31, 2015, borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.075% above the london interbank offered rate (libor).  a fee of 0.175% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility.  the interest rate and facility fee will be higher if our credit rating is lowered.
our long-term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facilities, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt.  the most restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional $5,495 million of secured debt at december 31, 2015.
in july 2015, hip, a 50/50 joint venture between us and gip, incurred $600 million of debt through a 5-year term loan a facility.  the proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners.  hip also entered into a $400 million 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility, which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit and is expected to fund the joint venture's operating activities and capital expenditures.  borrowings on both loan facilities generally bear interest at the libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 2.00%.  facility fees on the revolving credit facility accrue at an applicable rate every quarter, ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum.  the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on the joint venture's leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda).  if the joint venture obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time.  the joint venture's credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally
39
require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as ebitda to interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters.
at december 31, 2015, borrowings attributable to the joint venture, which are non-recourse to hess corporation, amounted to $600 million on the term loan a loan facility and $110 million on the revolving credit facility.  hip is in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31, 2015, and its financial covenants do not currently impact their ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures.
we also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.
credit ratings two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  in january 2016, fitch ratings (fitch) affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative.  in february 2016, standard and poor's ratings services (s&p) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb- with stable outlook and moody's investors service (moody's) lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade.  the consequence of lower credit ratings is to increase interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities.  in addition, we have contractual requirements to provide collateral to certain counterparties when one rating agency rates our unsecured debt below investment grade.  due to the recent rating change by moody's we may be required to issue collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $200 million.  certain other contracts require we provide collateral when two of three rating agencies rate us below investment grade.  if fitch or s&p were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue letters of credit up to an additional $200 million as of december 31, 2015.

(a)   we anticipate cash payments for interest of $391 million for 2016, $789 million for 2017-2018, $644 million for 2019-2020, and $3,988 million thereafter for a total of $5,812 million.

capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31, 2015, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2016.  obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.  other long‐term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2015, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions.
the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2015, we have $32 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable.  see also note 19, guarantees, contingencies and commitments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
foreign operations we conduct exploration and production activities outside the u.s., principally in europe (norway and denmark), africa (equatorial guinea, libya, and ghana) and asia and other (joint development area of malaysia/thailand, malaysia,
40
australia, guyana and canada).  therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk.  see item 1a. risk factors for further details.
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income.  the accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios.  however, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.
accounting for exploration and development costs:  e&p activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method.  costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers' fees and other related costs are capitalized.  annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred.  costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.  in production operations, costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found.  exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project.  if either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense.  indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.
crude oil and natural gas reserves:  the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities.  the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.  in addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project.  we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties.  our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies.  to provide consistency throughout the corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used.  the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review.  we also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.
proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.  as discussed in item 1a. risk factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves.  for example, the average west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $50.13 and $94.42 per barrel, respectively.  the drop in prices for 2015 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31, 2015 of 234 million barrels of oil equivalent, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves.  at december 31, 2015, spot prices for wti crude oil closed at $37.13 per barrel and averaged $31.78 per barrel in january 2016.  if crude oil prices in 2016 stay at levels below that used in determining 2015 proved reserves, we may recognize further negative revisions up to a significant majority of our december 31, 2015 proved undeveloped reserves.  in addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures.  conversely, price increases in 2016 above those used in determining 2015 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2016.  it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31, 2016, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2016 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2016 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices.  a 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $350 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2016.  see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 85 through 89 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.
bakken midstream joint venture:  on july 1, 2015 we sold a 50% interest in hess infrastructure partners lp (hip) to global infrastructure partners (gip) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion.  we consolidate the activities of
41
hip, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (vie) under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.  we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip.  this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hip's governance structure, the commercial agreements between hip and us, and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip.
impairment of long-lived assets:  we review long‐lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered.  long‐lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded.  the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‐based valuation approach, which are level 3 fair value measurements.
in the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management's best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate.  the projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.  the production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information.  oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices.
our impairment tests of long‐lived e&p producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed.  we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.  as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment.  see note 10, impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill:  goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process.  the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed.  prior to the second quarter of 2015, we had one operating segment, e&p consisting of two reporting units, offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager.  in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment, bakken midstream, which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit.  prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $1,098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $760 million.  upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment, we allocated $375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit.  there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit.
in step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount.  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination.  the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded.
our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share.  the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums.  we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit.  in addition, a qualitative reconciliation of our
42
market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values.
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two.  if a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value.
as there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset.
in the second quarter of 2015, we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment.  no impairment resulted from this assessment.  in addition, accounting standards require that following a reorganization, allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment.  we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30, 2015.  goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test.  as a result, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $385 million ($385 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting unit's goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards.
as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment test at december 31, 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired.  we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,098 million ($1,098 million after income taxes) to reflect the offshore reporting unit's goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards.  we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling $375 million will be recovered through the bakken midstream operating segment based on market conditions at december 31, 2015.
income taxes:  judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements.  these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination.
we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits.  additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities.  we have net deferred tax assets of $2,653 million recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2015.  regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized.  if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.  in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the reversal of temporary differences, the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors.   estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with our internal business forecasts.  additional valuation allowances may be required if internal business forecasts adopt lower selling price assumptions or development plans.  we do not provide for deferred u.s. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
asset retirement obligations:  we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‐lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations.  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated.  we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred.  in subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  in order to measure these obligations, we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations.  in determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate.  in addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology.  as a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above.  changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.
43
retirement plans:  we have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan.  we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet.
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‐term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions.  these assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors.  for example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‐quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.  changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements.
derivatives:  we utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet.  our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative.  the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges).  the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings.  changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.
fair value measurements:  we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches.  our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.  counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities.
we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles.  these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.
we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data.  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2.
when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market.  multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.
environment, health and safety our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business.  our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (ehs & sr) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities.  our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs & sr performance.  improved performance may, in the short‐term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate.  in addition to enhanced ehs & sr performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs & sr.  we have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs & sr goals and objectives.
44
we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  we assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations.  we are committed to complying with all greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities.
we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation.  sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, "superfund" sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party.
we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  at december 31, 2015, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million.  we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.  our remediation spending was approximately $13 million in 2015 (2014: $12 million; 2013: $16 million).  the level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.

cautionary note concerning forward-looking statements certain statements in this annual report on form 10-k constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies, integration of acquired businesses, new service offerings, financial prospects, and anticipated sources and uses of capital. words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. the following is a list of some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios; the inability of advertisers or affiliates to remit payment to us in a timely manner or at all; general economic and business conditions; industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, feature film, television and television commercial production; spending on domestic and foreign television advertising; disagreements with our distributors over contract interpretation; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and political unrest and regulatory changes in international markets; market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries; the regulatory and competitive environment of the industries in which we, and the entities in which we have interests, operate; uncertainties inherent in the development of new business lines and business strategies; uncertainties regarding the financial performance of our equity method investees; integration of acquired businesses; uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and provision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies; changes in the distribution and viewing of television programming, including the expanded deployment of personal video recorders, vod, internet protocol television, mobile personal devices and personal tablets and their impact on television advertising revenue; rapid technological changes; future financial performance, including availability, terms, and deployment of capital; the ability of suppliers and vendors to deliver products, equipment, software, and services; the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation; availability of qualified personnel; the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union; changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the federal communications commission and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings; changes in income taxes due to regulatory changes or changes in our corporate structure; changes in the nature of key strategic relationships with partners, distributors and equity method investee partners; competitor responses to our products and services and the products and services of the entities in which we have interests; threatened terrorist attacks and

military action; reduced access to capital markets or significant increases in costs to borrow; a failure to secure affiliate agreements or renewal of such agreements on less favorable terms; and a reduction of advertising revenue associated with unexpected reductions in the number of subscribers. for additional risk factors, refer to item 1a, "risk factors." these forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other factors speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-tv, free-to-air and broadcast television, websites, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel, our most widely distributed global brand, tlc, animal planet, investigation discovery and velocity (known as turbo outside of the u.s.). in 2014, we took a controlling interest in eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-tv programmer across europe and asia and in 2015, we acquired an additional 49% of and now own 100% of eurosport. we also develop and sell curriculum-based education products and services and operate production studios.
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, web-native networks, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dthsatellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, lifestyle, general entertainment, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. substantially all of our content is produced in hd format.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and websites, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and websites; and two combined operating segments referred to as education and other, consisting principally of curriculum-based product and service offerings and production studios. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.

results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014
items impacting comparability newly acquired businesses on may 30, 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport international. on march 31, 2015, we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport france and integrated the business into eurosport international, collectively referred to as eurosport. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we included the operations of eurosport international and eurosport france in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. as a result, eurosport has impacted the comparability of our results of operations between 2015 and 2014. accordingly, to assist the reader in understanding the changes in our results of operations, the results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 excluding eurosport are presented in the tables below (in millions). the results of operations for eurosport do not reflect the synergies from increased pan-european market penetration, which are reflected in the total company excluding eurosport amounts. adjustments for discovery family, which was acquired on september 23, 2014, the company's radio business in northern europe, which was disposed of on june 30, 2015, and other less significant acquisitions made during 2015 and 2014, were not made in the comparability tables as their results did not materially impact the comparability of operations, except as otherwise noted within this item. adjusted oibda is defined and a reconciliation to operating income is presented below in "segment results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014."

nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased 7% as a result of increases of 7% at our u.s. networks segment and 7% at our international networks segment. for u.s. networks, excluding the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased primarily due to annual contractual rate increases and, to a lesser extent, increases in digital distribution revenue, partially offset by slight declines in subscribers. the increase in our international networks' distribution revenue, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of eurosport, was mostly due to increases in affiliate rates and subscribers, in equivalent amounts, in latin america, and, a lesser extent, to increases in subscribers in ceemea and digital distribution revenue.

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increases of 11% at our international networks segment and, to a lesser extent, increases of 2% at our u.s. networks segment. the increase at our international networks segment was mostly driven by pricing and, to a lesser extent, ratings in southern europe and pricing, volume, and to a lesser extent, ratings in latin america. southern europe and latin america contributed to the increase in equivalent amounts. the increases were also, to a lesser extent, due to pricing in northern europe. these increases were partially offset by decreases due to changes in regulations involving advertising sales operations in russia, as further described in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k. u.s. networks' advertising revenue increased due to increases in pricing, partially offset by lower audience delivery.
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue increased 4%. this increase was primarily due to an increase at our education and other segments due to increased productions and, to a lesser extent, an increase at our international networks segment as result of increased program sales. these increases were offset by a decrease at our u.s. networks segment primarily due to the absence of representation service fees for discovery family, which have been eliminated since the company began to consolidate discovery family.
costs of revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisitions of eurosport, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 11% as result of increases of 12% at our international networks segment and 7% at our u.s. networks segment. the increases in costs of revenues were mostly due to our commitment to increased spending for content on our networks, which increased content amortization, and, to a lesser extent, increases in content impairments that were not included in restructuring and other charges. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family, content amortization was $1,458 million and $1,336 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. content amortization rates on our networks have been slightly accelerating.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, the consolidation of discovery family, and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expense at our international networks segment of 10% mostly due to increased personnel and associated support costs and, to a lesser extent, increased marketing costs. the increase was also, to a lesser extent, due to slight increases at our u.s. network segment due to an increase in research and, to a lesser extent, marketing costs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our equity-based compensation expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, business combinations and dispositions, depreciation and amortization remained consistent for the year ended december 31, 2015.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges decreased $40 million. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in content impairments resulting from the post-acquisition rebranding of the hub network to discovery family in 2014 (see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss (gain) on disposition loss on dispositions comprised $12 million for the sale of the sbs radio business and $5 million for the contribution of the russian business to a joint venture for the year ended december 31, 2015. gain on disposition comprised $31 million for the sale of howstuffworks for the year ended december 31, 2014. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

interest expense interest expense remained consistent for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
income from equity investees, net income from our equity method investees declined $22 million, mostly due to losses at all3media related to the amortization of intangible assets for the step up in the fair value of assets acquired from the investment following its acquisition on september 23, 2014, interest expense for the recapitalization of debt for the transaction and losses on derivative instruments. the decline was also, to a lesser extent, due to the change in accounting for discovery family from an equity method investment to a consolidated subsidiary, as well as decreased income at various other equity method investees.

other expense, net increased $88 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to foreign currency losses related to revaluation of our 1.90% euro-dominated senior notes due march 19, 2027, which expose discovery to fluctuations in euro exchange rates, as well as the revaluation of monetary assets in venezuela, due to changes in the bolivar exchange rate used to remeasure revenue and monetary asset balances (as further discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in this annual report on form 10-k). the increase was further attributable to a decrease in remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in eurosport on may 30, 2014 of $29 million, and eurosport france on march 31, 2015 of $2 million (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). these increases were slightly offset by the attribution expense related to the put right held by tf1, the holder of the remaining interests in eurosport and eurosport france, as a component of other expense, net in 2014, for which there is no similar expense in the 2015.

income tax expense was $511 million and $610 million and the effective tax rate was 33% and 35% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the net 2% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of multiple audit resolutions and the lapse of the statute of limitations in foreign and domestic jurisdictions, favorable impact to deferred taxes due to various enacted foreign legislative changes and the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions.

segment results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market equity-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives, (iv) restructuring and other charges, (v) certain impairment charges, (vi) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vii) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude mark-to-market equity-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. additionally, certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport, distribution revenue increased 7%. the increase was mostly due to increases in affiliate rates and subscribers, in equivalent amounts, in latin america and, to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in ceemea and digital distribution revenue. such growth is consistent with the continued development of the pay-tv markets in those regions.

selling, general and administrative excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10%. the increase was mostly due to increased personnel and associated support costs and, to a lesser extent, increased marketing costs.
adjusted oibda excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport, and the disposition of the company's radio business, adjusted oibda increased 5%. the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising and distribution revenue, partially offset by higher content expense and, to a lesser extent, higher selling, general, and administrative costs.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
adjusted oibda decreased 5%, mostly attributable to higher personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, fees related to investments and other matters, partially offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation expense for equity-settled awards such as stock options and prsus that are recorded at fair value at grant date and amortized over the vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments.
the decrease in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in discovery's stock price compared to 2014. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for sars and unit awards. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

results of operations - 2014 vs. 2013
items impacting comparability on may 30, 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport, and on april 9, 2013, we acquired sbs nordic (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). we included the operations of eurosport and sbs nordic ("newly acquired businesses") in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. as a result, newly acquired businesses have impacted the comparability of our results of operations between 2014 and 2013. accordingly, to assist the reader in understanding the changes in our results of operations, the following tables present the calculation of comparative adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("adjusted oibda") excluding the newly acquired businesses, as reported within our consolidated financial statements (in millions). the comparability of the results of the u.s. networks segment was not impacted by these acquisitions. the column newly acquired businesses for the year ended december 31, 2014 consists of the operating results of eurosport since its acquisition on may 30, 2014 and the results of sbs nordic for the three months ended march 31, 2014. newly acquired businesses do not include discovery family, which was acquired on september 23, 2014, the eight days of sbs nordic's results from april 1, 2013 through april 9, 2013 or other, less significant, acquisitions made during 2014, because their results did not materially impact the comparability of operations, except as otherwise noted within this item. adjusted oibda is defined and a reconciliation to operating income is presented below in "segment results of operations - 2014 vs. 2013."

consolidated results of operations - 2014 vs. 2013
our consolidated results of operations for 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in millions). the discussion of our results that follows reflects our management reporting structure for international networks prior to january 1, 2015. effective january 1, 2015, we realigned our international networks management reporting structure into the following regions: northern europe, which includes primarily the nordic countries, which we refer to as the nordics, and u.k.; southern europe, which primarily includes italy and spain; central and eastern europe, the middle east, and africa ("ceemea"), which has been expanded to include germany; latin america; asia-pacific; and eurosport. previously, international networks' regional operations reporting structure was segregated into the following regions: western europe, which included the u.k. and western european countries; nordics; ceemea; latin america; asia-pacific; and eurosport. this realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the international networks segment from january 1, 2015.

nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, newly acquired businesses and the effects of the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased 3% as a result of an increase of 9% at our international networks segment, partially offset by a decrease of 2% at our u.s. networks segment. the increase in our international networks' distribution revenue, excluding the impact of foreign currency and newly acquired businesses, was mostly attributable to revenue growth in latin america and, to a lesser extent, to growth in ceemea. the revenue growth in latin america was due to increases in subscribers and affiliate rates and in ceemea was due to increases in subscribers. for u.s. networks, excluding declines in digital distribution resulting from lower content deliveries offset by an increase due to the consolidation of discovery family (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), distribution revenue increased by 6% primarily due to contractual rate increases. digital distribution revenue, which is earned under agreements to license programs, is recognized when the content has been delivered and is available for use by the customer. digital distribution revenue is therefore prone to fluctuations based on the timing and volume of content deliveries.

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, and the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, which is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, advertising revenue increased 7% as a result of increases of 14% at our international networks segment and 2% at our u.s. networks segment. for our international networks segment, the increase was mostly due to pricing and ratings increases on our free-to-air networks in western europe and, to a lesser extent, pricing increases in the nordics and volume increases in latin america. for our u.s. networks segment, the increase was mostly due to increases in pricing and to a lesser extent, the volume of commercial units sold, partially offset by lower audience delivery.
excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, other revenue increased 2%. the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue at our education and other segments due to other business combinations in late 2013 and early 2014, offset by a decrease in representation fees at u.s. networks.
costs of revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, newly acquired businesses, the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and digital distribution, costs of revenues increased 10%. the increase was the result of increases of 12% at our international networks segment, 6% at our u.s. networks segment and 20% at our education and other segments. the increase in costs of revenues at our international networks segment was primarily attributable to increased investment in content acquired from u.s. networks and locally acquired content, and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales commissions. the increase in costs of revenues at our u.s. networks segment was primarily attributable to an increase in content expense due to additional spending on content in current and recent periods. these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales commissions.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in equity-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in marketing expenses. these decreases were partially offset by increases in personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, various other items. the decrease in equity-based compensation expense was due to decreases in our share price.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization expense increased $53 million. the increase was mostly attributable to amortization of intangible assets of businesses acquired during 2014. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $74 million in 2014. the increase was mostly related to content impairments resulting from the post acquisition rebranding of the hub network to discovery family, and the cancellation of certain high profile series due to legal circumstances pertaining to the associated talent, and, to a lesser extent, employee terminations associated with the integration of recent acquisitions. (see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
gain on disposition gain on disposition was $31 million for the sale of hsw and $19 million for the sale of petfinder for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased $22 million due to an increase in outstanding debt.

income from equity investees, net income from our equity method investees increased $5 million in 2014, due to improved operating results at own offset by losses at all3media related to economic hedges that did not receive hedge accounting and the amortization of intangibles for the step up in the fair value of assets acquired.

other (expense) income, net, decreased $58 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in remeasurement gains recognized related to the acquisition of former equity method investees (see note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and foreign currency losses in 2014, offset by derivative losses related to the acquisition of sbs on april 9, 2013 for which there is no similar item in the current period. the changes in foreign currency are primarily driven by the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities in the nordic region and venezuela and, to a lesser extent, russia.

income tax expense was $610 million and $659 million and the effective tax rates was 35% and 38% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. the net 3% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several factors, including a decline in other, net driven by nondeductible hedging losses associated with the acquisition of sbs nordic on april 9, 2013 and the reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the change in tax rate in the united kingdom in the prior year, for which no similar change took place in the current period. additionally, the decrease for 2014 included a 1% decrease related to the domestic production activities deduction following certain legislative changes in 2013. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 2% in the 2014 tax rate due to the $92 million remeasurement gain on the previously held equity interest in discovery japan recognized upon consolidation in 2013, which was not taxable because we intend to defer indefinitely the realization of this gain for tax purposes.

revenues distribution revenue decreased $5 million. excluding declines in digital distribution resulting from lower content deliveries and an increase due to the consolidation of discovery family, distribution revenue increased by 6% primarily due to contractual rate increases, as the subscriber base for the u.s. pay television market has declined slightly. digital distribution revenue, which is earned under agreements to license selected library titles, is recognized when the content has been delivered and is available for use by the customer.
advertising revenue increased 2%. the increase was mostly attributable to increases in pricing and, to a lesser extent, the volume of commercial units sold, partially offset by lower audience delivery.
other revenue decreased 27%. the decrease was mostly attributable to lower representation fees, which have been eliminated now that discovery family has been consolidated, as well as decreases in various other items.
costs of revenues excluding the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and digital distribution, costs of revenues increased 6% in 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in content expense due to additional spending on content in current and prior years. these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales commissions.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% in 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in marketing costs.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda decreased 2% in 2014. revenue for 2014 was consistent with the prior period as increases in advertising revenue were largely offset by decreases in digital distribution revenue and other revenue. higher costs in the current year were primarily due to increased content expense, which was partially offset by lower marketing costs.

revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly attributable to revenue growth in latin america, and to a lesser extent, to growth in ceemea. the revenue growth in latin america was due to increases in subscribers and affiliate rates, while in ceemea it was due to increases in subscribers. such growth is consistent with the continued development of the pay television markets in those regions.
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, advertising revenue increased 14%. the increase was mostly due to pricing and ratings increases on our free-to-air networks in western europe and, to a lesser extent, pricing increases in the nordics and volume increases in latin america.
excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, other revenue was consistent with the prior period.
costs of revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, costs of revenues increased 12%. the increase was primarily attributable to increased investment in u.s. networks' and locally acquired content in recent years, and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales commissions.
selling, general and administrative excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, selling, general and administrative expenses remained comparable with the prior year. cost reductions in marketing were offset by increased personnel costs to support a localization strategy as certain activities are transitioned out of regional hubs.
adjusted oibda excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses, adjusted oibda increased 16%. the increase was due to increases in advertising revenue and distribution revenue, partially offset by increased content expense, sales commissions and personnel costs.

adjusted oibda decreased $24 million. increased revenue attributable to business combinations that took place late 2013 and early 2014 was more than offset by the operating costs of those businesses as well as contingent consideration recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense for earn outs at acquired businesses.
corporate and inter-segment eliminations the following table presents, for our unallocated corporate amounts, revenue, certain operating expenses, adjusted oibda, and a reconciliation of adjusted oibda to operating loss (in millions).

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
adjusted oibda decreased 10% mostly attributable to increased personnel costs to support a broader corporate function for international operations.
the decrease in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was attributable to decreases in discovery stock price during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for sars and unit awards. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we have funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2015, we had $390 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
49
•   senior notes as a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets. on march 2, 2015, discovery communications, llc ("dcl"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $300 million principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due march 15, 2025. additionally, on march 19, 2015, dcl issued €600 million principal amount ($637 million, at issuance, based on the exchange rate of $1.06 per euro at march 19, 2015) of 1.90% senior notes due march 19, 2027. all of dcl's outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by discovery and contain certain nonfinancial covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.
we maintain an effective registration statement on form s-3 that allows us to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.
•   commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1.0 billion. the maturities of these notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the credit ratings assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2015, we had $93 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.10% and maturities of less than 90 days.
•   revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2015, we had access to a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. in february 2016, the company amended and restated the revolving credit facility to extend dcl's borrowing capacity to $2.0 billion, extend the maturity date to february 4, 2021 and provide the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $782 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.55%. borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates that vary based on dcl's periodic debt ratings. dcl also has the ability to request an increase of the revolving credit facility up to an aggregate additional $1.0 billion, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery. borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. dcl, its subsidiaries and discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. the credit agreement also requires dcl to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3:00 to 1:00 and a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no more than 4:50 to 1:00. as of december 31, 2015, discovery, dcl and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
•   notes receivable we have an outstanding note receivable from own, our equity method investee, which totals $384 million including interest. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company received net repayments from own of $82 million and $56 million, respectively. borrowings are scheduled for repayment four years after the borrowing date to the extent that own has excess cash to repay the borrowings then due.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest on our outstanding senior notes, and funding for various equity method and other investments.
50
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we committed to acquire exclusive broadcast rights across all media platforms throughout europe for the four olympic games between 2018 and 2024 for €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of december 31, 2015). the broadcast rights exclude the u.k. and france for the olympic games in 2018 and 2020, and exclude russia. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k.
•   business combinations and investments in 2015, our uses of cash have included business combinations (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). due to business combinations in current and prior years, we also have redeemable equity balances of $241 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company. on march 31, 2015, we acquired from tf1 a controlling interest in eurosport france by increasing discovery's ownership stake from 20% to 51% for cash of approximately €36 million ($38 million). on july 22, 2015, tf1 exercised its right to put the entirety of its remaining 49% noncontrolling interest in eurosport to the company for €491 million ($551 million as of september 30, 2015). on october 1, 2015, the company closed the transaction for €491 million ($548 million). (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) the company borrowed an additional $525 million under the revolving credit facility on october 1, 2015 in order to facilitate the transaction.
•   equity method investments we have interests in various equity method investees and provide funding to those equity method investees from time to time. as of december 31, 2015, we have outstanding advances to and a note receivable from own, our equity method investee, which totals $384 million including interest. we may provide additional funding to our equity method investees, if necessary, and expect to recoup amounts funded. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   available-for-sale securities in 2015, our uses of cash included the acquisition of 5 million shares of an entertainment company for $195 million. as the shares have a readily determinable fair value and the company has the intent to retain the investment, the shares are classified as available-for-sale ("afs") securities. in connection with this transaction, we hedged 50% of the shares with an equity collar for $4 million. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   common stock repurchase program under the company's stock repurchase program, management is authorized to purchase shares of the company's common stock from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices, pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase agreements, or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors. as of december 31, 2015, the company had repurchased over the life of the program 3 million and 115 million shares of series a and series c common stock, respectively, for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $5.3 billion, respectively. over the life of the program, authorization under the stock repurchase program has totaled $7.5 billion. as of december 31, 2015, the company had remaining authorization of approximately $2.0 billion for future repurchases under the existing stock repurchase program, of which $41 million and $2.0 billion will expire on february 3, 2016 and october 8, 2017, respectively. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we have been funding our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in the future we may also choose to fund our stock repurchase program through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions.
•   preferred stock conversion and repurchase we have an agreement with advance/newhouse to repurchase, on a quarterly basis, a number of shares of series c convertible preferred stock convertible into 3/7 of the number of shares of series c common stock purchased under the company's stock repurchase program during the then most recently completed fiscal quarter. the price paid per share is calculated as 99% of the average price paid for the series c common shares repurchased by the company during the applicable fiscal quarter multiplied by the series c conversion rate. the advance/newhouse repurchases are made outside of the company's publicly announced stock repurchase program. during 2015, we converted and retired 4 million shares of our series c convertible preferred stock under the preferred stock conversion and
51
repurchase arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $253 million. based on the number of shares of series c common stock purchased during the three months ended december 31, 2015, the company expects advance/newhouse to effectively convert and sell to the company 3 million shares of its series c convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of $159 million on or about february 22, 2016. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we made cash payments of $653 million and $312 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   equity-based compensation we expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled equity awards. actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding. during 2015, we paid $25 million for cash-settled equity awards. as of december 31, 2015, we had accrued liabilities of $54 million for outstanding cash-settled equity awards, of which $5 million was classified as current. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   debt maturities on march 31, 2015, we redeemed $850 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior notes that had an original maturity date of june 1, 2015. the repayments included a payment of $1 million for the original issue discount on the company's senior notes and resulted in a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of $5 million for make-whole premiums.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased $41 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency fluctuations that impacted the company's operating performance, increased content investment of $90 million and decreases in working capital of $182 million due to decreases in accounts payable and accruals. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in cash payments for equity-based compensation of $56 million.
cash provided by operating activities increased $33 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results and operating cash flows from acquired businesses partially offset by an increase in content investment of $257 million and taxes paid of $202 million.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased $267 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $292 million and a decrease in investments in equity method investees of $116 million. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in investments in available-for-sale and cost method investments of $208 million.
52
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash paid for business combinations of $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in realized losses for derivatives used to economically hedge business combinations of $55 million (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), partially offset by an increase in investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity method investees of $149 million for the investment in a 50% ownership interest in all3media, a production studio company during 2014 (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased $168 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to the purchase of tf1's 49% noncontrolling interest in eurosport for $548 million, an increase in net repayments of commercial paper of $365 million, an increase in cash distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests of $40 million and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of our interest rate contracts of $29 million (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). these increases were partially offset by increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $318 million and a decrease in the repurchases of stock of $471 million.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $649 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in cash used was primarily due to a reduction in the proceeds from borrowings on an aggregated, net basis from senior notes, commercial paper and the revolving credit facility of $516 million during 2014 as compared to 2013, as well as an increase in share repurchases of $117 million.
capital resources as of december 31, 2015, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).

(a) outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $93 million as of december 31, 2015 are supported by unused committed capacity under the revolving credit facility and reduce unused capacity. there were $782 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
(b) interest on senior notes is paid annually or semi-annually. our senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2015 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2019 and 2043.
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2015, we held $95 million of our $390 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized u.s. deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

the above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. for example, as of december 31, 2015, we have recorded $241 million for redeemable equity (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), although we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. the current portion of the liability for cash-settled equity-based compensation awards was $5 million as of december 31, 2015. additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $173 million as of december 31, 2015.
the above table also does not include dcl's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended december 31, 2015, allowed dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to $1.5 billion, including a $750 million sublimit for multi-currency borrowings, a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program discussed below. dcl also had the ability to request an increase of the revolving credit facility up to an aggregate additional $1.0 billion, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. as of december 31, 2015, the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of june 20, 2019. in february 2016, the company amended and restated the revolving credit facility to extend dcl's borrowing capacity up to $2.0 billion, to eliminate the multi-currency borrowing sublimit, to extend the maturity date to february 4, 2021 and to provide the option to request up to two additional 364-day renewal periods.
lastly, such funding obligations include funding commitments to equity method investees.
long-term debt principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity.
capital lease obligations we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year capital lease arrangements. principal payments on capital lease obligations reflect amounts due under our capital lease agreements. interest payments on our outstanding capital lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our capital lease agreements.
operating lease obligations we obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.

purchase obligations content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. if the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. the commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.
other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing research, employment contracts, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. the company has contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events.
put rights the company has granted put rights related to an equity method investment and certain consolidated subsidiaries. harpo has the right to require the company to purchase all or part of its interest in own for fair value during a 90-day window every two and a half years commencing january 1, 2016. no amounts have been recorded by the company for the harpo put right. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) hasbro and j:com have the right to require the company to purchase their remaining noncontrolling interests in discovery family and discovery japan, respectively. the company recorded the value of the put rights for discovery family and discovery japan as a component of redeemable equity in the amounts of $214 million and $26 million, respectively. on july 22, 2015, tf1 exercised its right to put the entirety of its remaining 49% noncontrolling interest in eurosport to the company for €491 million ($551 million as of the date redemption became mandatory). the transaction closed on october 1, 2015 for $548 million. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4) of regulation s-k) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily our equity method investees and liberty media and liberty global. information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting and reporting pronouncements we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2015. information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k and accompanying notes. management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company. we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition;
55
•   goodwill and intangible assets;
•   income taxes;
•   content rights;
•   equity-based compensation; and
•   equity method investments.
with respect to our goodwill accounting policy, we clarify the following:
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. for goodwill impairment testing purposes, we aggregate certain components or reporting units based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, the extent of shared assets and resources and similar financial performance. the extent of economic similarities between reporting units impacts the aggregation of these components into a reporting unit. we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. prior to the aggregation of certain reporting units in 2015, our reporting units were as follows: u.s. networks, northern europe, southern europe, ceemea, eurosport, latin america, asia-pacific, education, raw, betty, and u.s. studios.
during 2015, we determined that our northern europe, southern europe, ceemea and eurosport reporting units met the aggregation criteria and we aggregated them into one reporting unit, europe. in the aggregation assessment, we considered various factors including the nature of the components' operations and the extent to which the components share assets. in 2015 there were significant operational and back-office integration activities with respect to recently acquired businesses such as eurosport and sbs nordic, as well as changes in management reporting. european components share content and uplink facilities as well as certain management personnel, and back-office support functions. investment in research and development projects and the investment in the pan-european olympics rights deal support the growth of all european components. recently acquired businesses have been integrated into the european advertising and affiliate sales functions, which determine the selling strategies and revenue growth of the european businesses in the aggregate. we performed a goodwill impairment test on each reporting unit prior to aggregation. no impairments were identified.
during 2015, we determined that our production studios, raw, betty and u.s. studios, reporting units met the aggregation criteria and we aggregated them into one reporting unit. in 2015, the studios businesses were realigned under a new, single management team to unify strategy. in the aggregation assessment, we considered various factors including the nature of the components' operations, the similarity of operating margins by production genre and the management structure of the components. studios components are managed by the studios group executing a broader strategy, operate in a similar manner, and have similar products and customers. we performed a goodwill impairment test on each reporting unit prior to aggregation. no impairments were identified.
as a result of the european and studios aggregations, we reduced the number of our reporting units from eleven to six.
for 2015, we performed qualitative assessments prior to aggregation for all but three of our reporting units. each of these reporting units had a fair value that exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 45% as of the date of the last quantitative impairment assessment. our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key personnel and our share price. based on this assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for our remaining three reporting units, eurosport, raw, and betty, which had aggregate goodwill of $763 million as of november 30, 2015. the first step of the assessment required the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. in performing the first step, we determined the fair value of these reporting units by using a combination of a discounted cash flow ("dcf") analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. determining fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on the reporting unit's budget, long-term business plan, and recent operating performance. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. in assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values, we also evaluated the results against other value indicators, such as comparable analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions. the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value by 8% to 26%. the reporting unit with fair value in excess of
56
carrying value of less than 10% related to a recent acquisition, eurosport, which was not integrated into another reporting unit prior to this quantitative assessment. subsequent to this quantitative impairment assessment, the business was aggregated as a component of the europe reporting unit. significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included discount rates that ranged from 9% to 15% and long-term growth rates that ranged from 2% to 3.5%.
given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a dcf analysis, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations.
for an in depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, digital home, emerging growth, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale, printing and storage industries.
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of design and manufacturing services to companies that utilize electronics components. the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. in mid-2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut-backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time. in response to this downturn in the technology sector, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. in addition, the number of industries serviced, as well as the market penetration in certain industries, by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years. in mid-2008, the industrys revenue declined when a deteriorating macro-economic environment resulted in illiquidity in global credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american, european and asian markets. in response to this downturn, and the termination of our business relationship with blackberry limited, we implemented additional restructuring programs, including the restructuring plans that were approved by our board of directors in fiscal year 2014 (the 2014 restructuring plan) and in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013 restructuring plan), to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers.
we continue to try to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change.
at august 31, 2015, our reportable operating segments consisted of two segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and diversified manufacturing services (dms). our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, sharing of our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment includes customers primarily in the automotive, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale, printing and storage industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions and a focus on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, emerging growth, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from design services and excess inventory sales. revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant
37
working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material-based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing-based revenue. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing-based revenue than we do on materials-based revenue. as we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which may result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we largely economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. see risk factors  we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
we currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers, a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us or the termination or substantial winding down of our business relationship with one of our customers has previously had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. we could in the future terminate, or substantially wind down, significant customer relationships. any such termination or substantial winding down of a customer or manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. see risk factors  because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of those customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue, risk factors  most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity, risk factors  our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note 12  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2015 increased approximately 13.6% to $17.9 billion compared to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand as well as increased revenues from customers within our telecommunications and automotive businesses.

during the three months ended august 31, 2015, days in inventory increased 1 day to 52 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to increased demand and to support expected revenue levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. during the three months ended may 31, 2015, days in inventory increased 3 days to 51 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely to support expected revenue levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. during the three months ended february 28, 2015, days in inventory increased 3 days to 48 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely to support expected ems sales levels in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. during the three months ended november 30, 2014, days in inventory decreased 3 days to 45 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter primarily due to increased sales activity as well as a focus on inventory management. during the three months ended august 31, 2015, may 31, 2015 and february 28, 2015, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained relatively consistent at 7 turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter, respectively. during the three months ended november 30, 2014, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained consistent at 8 turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter.
during the three months ended august 31, 2015, may 31, 2015, february 28, 2015 and november 30, 2014, days in accounts payable increased 1 day to 76 days, increased 4 days to 75 days, decreased 1 day to 71 days and decreased 1 day to 72 days, respectively, from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters.
39
the sales cycle was 4 days during the three months ended august 31, 2015, 1 day during the three months ended may 31, 2015, 4 days during the three months ended february 28, 2015 and 4 days during the three months ended november 30, 2014. the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from design services and excess inventory sales. revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
40
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test.
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations. actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. this rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. when considering the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to note 9  postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.
the internal revenue service (irs) completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a revenue agents report on may 27, 2015 proposing adjustments primarily related to u.s. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 would be approximately $34.6 million after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2011. also, the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. the irs may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. at this time, anticipating the amount of any future irs proposed adjustments, interest, and penalties is not practicable.
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable irs administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties, which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. despite this belief, an unfavorable resolution, particularly if the irs successfully asserts similar claims for later years, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors  we are subject to the risk of increased taxes.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 17  new accounting guidance to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.

the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014
net revenue. net revenue increased 13.6% to $17.9 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $15.8 billion during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. specifically, the dms segment revenues increased 39% primarily as a result of increased revenues from customers within our mobility business due to strengthened end user product demand. ems segment revenues increased 1%, which was primarily attributable to increased revenues from customers within our telecommunications and automotive businesses, which was partially offset by reductions in the sale of mobility handsets as a result of our disengagement from blackberry limited.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary conditions; efforts to de-emphasize the economic performance of certain portions of our business; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships. as of september 1, 2014, we are reporting our business in the following two segments  ems and dms. prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, we were reporting our business in three segments. in conjunction with this reorganization, there have been certain reclassifications made within the reported segments.
on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our aftermarket services (ams) business except for the malaysian operations, for which the sale was completed on december 31, 2014. the ams business was included in the dms segment, and the results of operations of this business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. see note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2015               2014                2013
ems              60   %              67   %              70   %
dms              40   %              33   %              30   %
total           100   %             100   %             100   %
foreign source revenue represented 88.0% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 and 84.5% of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. we currently expect our foreign source revenue to increase as compared to current levels over the course of the next 12 months.
gross profit. gross profit increased to $1.5 billion (8.4% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $1.0 billion (6.5% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue is primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers within the dms segment, as well as an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $862.6 million (4.8% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $675.7 million (4.3% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 was the result of an increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs due to increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business, as well as a $45.8 million reversal to stock-based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain restricted stock awards.
research and development. research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $27.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $28.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.
amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles remained relatively consistent at $24.4 million of during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 as compared to $23.9 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.
restructuring and related charges.
a.   2014 restructuring plan

we recorded $49.9 million of restructuring and related charges during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. we have completed our restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the 2014 restructuring plan.
b.   2013 restructuring plan

in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $34.6 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to $35.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the 2013 restructuring plan is intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses. these restructuring activities are intended to address current market conditions and customer requirements. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal years ended august 31, 2015 and 2014 include cash costs of $24.3 million and $25.0 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $2.8 million and $0.5 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.9 million and $1.3 million of other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $5.6 million and $8.6 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, $39.3 million was paid related to the 2013 restructuring plan. at august 31, 2015, accrued liabilities of approximately $30.3 million related to the 2013 restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months.
we currently expect to recognize approximately $179.0 million, excluding the restructuring and related charges previously incurred for the ams discontinued operations, in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs over the course of fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 under the 2013 restructuring plan. the restructuring and related charges are expected to include $149.4 million of employee severance and benefit costs; $21.6 million of asset write-off costs; $3.5 million of contract termination costs and $4.5 million of other related costs. since the inception of the 2013 restructuring plan, a total of $150.5 million of restructuring and related costs have been recognized as of august 31, 2015. the charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, excluding asset write-off costs, are currently expected to result in cash expenditures of approximately $157.4 million that have been or will be payable over the course
43
of our fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. much of the 2013 restructuring plan as discussed reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain plants are still subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions and consultation with our employees and their representatives.
upon its completion, the 2013 restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $76.8 million. the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of $72.5 million, a reduction in depreciation expense associated with asset disposals of $3.1 million, and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately $1.2 million. the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. these annual costs savings are expected to be partially offset by decreased revenues and incremental costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which certain production will be shifted. after considering these partial cost savings offsets, we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $65.0 million.
other expense. other expense decreased to $5.6 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to $7.6 million for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a step acquisition gain of $6.2 million on a previously held equity interest investment offset by a loss associated with a cost method investment.
interest income. we recorded interest income of $10.0 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to dividends (which are treated as interest income) on the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock received in connection with the sale of the ams business on april 1, 2014.
interest expense. interest expense remained consistent at $128.1 million for each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 31.8% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, compared to an effective tax rate of 102.2% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 decreased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations in low tax-rate jurisdictions during fiscal year 2015. this effective tax rate decrease was partially offset by the tax benefit from revaluing deferred tax assets related to the enactment of the mexico 2014 tax reform during fiscal year 2014, the reversal of stock-based compensation expense with minimal related tax expense during fiscal year 2014, and a partial valuation allowance release related to the u.s. deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2014.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2013
net revenue. our net revenue decreased 8.6% to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2014, compared to $17.2 billion for fiscal year 2013. specific decreases include a 12% decrease in the sale of ems products due principally to reductions in the sale of mobility handsets as a result of our disengagement with blackberry limited and the continued decline in enterprise and infrastructure spending and a 2% decrease in the sale of dms products as a result of reduced production levels due to weakened end user product demand within our mobility business, which was partially offset by increased revenue from new customers as a result of the nypro acquisition.
foreign source revenue represented 84.5% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2014 and 86.8% of net revenue for fiscal year 2013.
for further discussion of our net revenues, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2014  net revenue.
gross profit. gross profit decreased to $1.0 billion (6.5% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2014 compared to $1.2 billion (7.0% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013. the decrease in gross profit is due to our revenues from existing customers decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our fixed costs, which is partially offset by increased revenue from new customers.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $675.7 million (4.3% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2014 compared to $614.3 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013. selling, general and administrative expense increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily as a result of an increase to incremental selling, general and administrative expense resulting from the acquisition of nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, which tends to generate a higher amount of selling, general and administrative expenses on a relative basis than our other operations, and an increase due to the increased investment in our strategic development sector. the increase was partially offset by a decrease to selling, general and administrative expense resulting from a $45.8 million reversal to stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2014 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain restricted stock awards.
44
research and development. r&d expenses remained relatively consistent over the prior period at $28.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year ended 2014 compared to $28.4 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013.
amortization of intangibles. we recorded $23.9 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2014 as compared to $11.0 million in fiscal year 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with the finite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of nypro, partially offset by a decrease to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august 31, 2013. for additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see acquisitions and expansion below, note 1(f)  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  goodwill and other intangible assets, note 7  goodwill and other intangible assets and note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and related charges.
a. 2014 restructuring plan during fiscal year 2014, we recorded $49.9 million of restructuring and related charges related to the 2014 restructuring plan.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2014 restructuring plan, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2014  restructuring and related charges.
b. 2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $35.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to $80.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013. the 2013 restructuring plan is intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses. these restructuring activities are intended to address current market conditions and customer requirements. the restructuring and related charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2014 and 2013 include cash costs of $25.0 million and $74.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.5 million and $0.2 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.3 million and $0.0 million related to other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $8.6 million and $6.0 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2014  restructuring and related charges.
loss on disposal of subsidiaries. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we recorded a loss of approximately $8.0 million related to the sale of our controlling financial interests in two nypro subsidiaries.
impairment of notes receivable and related charges. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million related to notes receivable and related charges. such a charge was recorded following the determination that it was probable that we would be unable to collect the amounts due from a former customer.
other expense. other expense did not change significantly for fiscal year 2014 at $7.6 million compared to $6.1 million for fiscal year 2013.
interest income. we recorded interest income of $3.7 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $1.8 million for fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily due to dividends (which are treated as interest income) on the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock received in connection with the sale of the ams business on april 1, 2014.
interest expense. we recorded $128.1 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2014 as compared to $121.0 million in fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily due to incremental interest associated with increased borrowings from our credit facility then in existence.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 102.2% for fiscal year 2014, as compared to an effective tax rate of 2.3% for fiscal year 2013.
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013 primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations during fiscal year 2014 in low tax-rate jurisdictions that had minimal related tax benefit and the release of existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2013. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by a tax benefit from revaluing deferred tax assets related to the enactment of the mexico 2014 tax reform and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense with minimal related tax benefit.
45
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we recorded out-of-period adjustments that increased net income from continuing operations by approximately $17.1 million, which related to fiscal year 2013 income tax benefit adjustments that were recorded in fiscal year 2014. we assessed and concluded that these adjustments are not material to either the consolidated quarterly or annual financial statements for all impacted periods.
non-u.s. gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s. gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may be making associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed six acquisitions during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015. acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. see risk factors  we have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions; and some divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
seasonality production levels for a portion of the dms segment are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to higher demand for consumer related products manufactured in the dms segment during the holiday selling season.
liquidity and capital resources at august 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $914.0 million, total notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities, $500.0 million in available liquidity under our term loan facility and up to $235.2 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs. we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 was approximately $1.2 billion. this resulted primarily from net income of $285.6 million, a $984.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, $529.2 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, a $113.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $62.6 million of recognized stock-based compensation expense and related charges; which were partially offset by a $483.1 million increase in inventories and a $292.7 million increase in accounts receivable. the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments as well as advanced deposits made from customers. the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to decreases in advance deposits and decreases in the deferred purchase price receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs due to an increase in funding provided by the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions. the increase in inventories was primarily due to increased demand and to support expected revenue levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the timing of sales and collections activity coupled with higher sales levels.
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 was $1.1 billion. this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $963.1 million principally for machinery and equipment for new business particularly within our dms segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades. in addition, $177.6 million of cash was paid for business acquisitions, net of cash received.
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 was $162.5 million. this resulted from our receipt of approximately $6.0 billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements, which primarily included an aggregate of $5.7 billion of borrowings under the revolving credit facility. this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately $6.0 billion, which primarily included an aggregate of $5.7 billion of repayments under the revolving credit facility. in addition, during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 we paid $85.6 million, including commissions, to repurchase 4,392,664 of our common shares, we paid $63.1 million in dividends to stockholders and we paid $7.6 million (the equivalent of 402,143 of our common shares) to the irs on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards (as consideration for these payments to the irs, we withheld $7.6 million of employee-owned common stock related to this vesting).
sources we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our other revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time-to-time over the three years following the registration, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. the current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement. any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders. further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations, increase debt service obligations, limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially negatively affect our credit ratings, and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares.
we regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and three uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs. in addition, refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.
50
also, as described in note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements, on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our ams business except for the malaysian operations, for which the sale was completed on december 31, 2014. we completed these sales for consideration of $725.0 million, which consisted of $675.0 million in cash and an aggregate liquidation preference value of $50.0 million in senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock of iqor that accretes dividends at an annual rate of 8 percent and is redeemable in nine years or upon a change in control. as a result of the sale, we have additional funds to finance certain of our needs.
a. asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions (for the north american asset-backed securitization program) and to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution (for the foreign asset-backed securitization program). any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $200.0 million for the north american asset-backed securitization program, currently scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017 (as the program was renewed on october 21, 2014), are available at any one time. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $175.0 million for the foreign asset-backed securitization program, currently scheduled to expire on may 1, 2018 (as the program was renewed on may 8, 2015), are available at any one time. we increased our facility limit for the foreign asset-backed securitization program from $75.0 million to $175.0 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.
in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, at august 31, 2015, we sold $801.7 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $372.4 million and a deferred purchase price receivable. at august 31, 2015, the deferred purchase price receivable in connection with the asset-backed securitization programs totaled $429.3 million. the deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
b. trade accounts receivable sale programs in connection with three separate trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions, we may elect to sell, at a discount, on an ongoing basis, up to a maximum of $450.0 million, $150.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. the $450.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that was amended during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 to increase the uncommitted capacity from $350.0 million to $450.0 million and is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2015, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $450.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program will be automatically extended each year until august 31, 2017, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. the $150.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that is subject to expiration on august 31, 2016 (as the agreement was extended on august 31, 2015). the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program is an uncommitted facility that is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2015, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale program will be automatically extended each year until november 1, 2018, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015, we sold $2.1 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $2.1 billion.

(a)         during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we issued $312.0 million of seven-year, publicly-registered 7.750% notes (the 7.750% senior notes) at 96.1% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately
$300.0 million. the 7.750% senior notes mature on july 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually on january 15 and july 15. also, the 7.750% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(b)              during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2008, we issued $250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of ten-year, unregistered 8.250% notes at 99.965% of par and 97.5% of par, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.7 million and $148.5 million, respectively. on july 18, 2008, we completed an exchange whereby all of the outstanding unregistered 8.250% notes were exchanged for registered 8.250% notes (collectively the
8.250% senior notes) that are substantially identical to the unregistered notes except that the 8.250% senior notes are registered under the securities act and do not have any transfer restrictions, registration rights or rights to additional special interest.

the 8.250% senior notes mature on march 15, 2018 and pay interest semiannually on march 15 and september 15. the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% senior notes increase or decrease, as provided in the 8.250% senior notes. the 8.250% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
(c)              during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we issued $400.0 million of ten-year publicly registered 5.625% notes (the 5.625% senior notes) at par. the net proceeds from the offering of $400.0 million were used to fully repay the term portion of the credit facility dated as of july 19, 2007 (the old credit facility) and partially repay amounts outstanding under our foreign asset-backed securitization program. the 5.625% senior notes mature on december 15, 2020. interest on the 5.625% senior notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning on june 15, 2011. the 5.625% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(d)               during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we issued $500.0 million of ten-year publicly registered 4.700% notes (the 4.700% senior notes) at 99.992% of par. the net proceeds from the offering of $500.0
million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes. the 4.700% senior notes mature on september 15, 2022 and pay interest semiannually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning on march 15, 2013. the 4.700% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(e)                    as of august 31, 2015, nine of our foreign subsidiaries have credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. five of the credit facilities are denominated in u.s.
dollars, one is denominated in brazilian reais, one is denominated in euros, one is denominated in russian rubles and one is denominated in taiwan new dollar. the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 0.8% to
28.0%.

on july 6, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five year credit agreement. the credit agreement provides for the revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.5 billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, potentially be increased up to $2.0 billion and a $500.0 million five year delayed draw term loan facility. the term loan facility may be drawn in whole or in part (but on no more than two occasions) until september 30, 2015. both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility expire on july 6, 2020, but in the case of the revolving credit facility, subject to two
52
whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion. interest and fees on revolving credit facility and term loan facility advances are based on our non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by standard & poors ratings service, moodys investors service and fitch ratings. interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either 0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to 1.000% above the base rate or 1.125% to 2.000% above the eurocurrency rate, in each case where the base rate represents the greatest of citibank, n.a.s base rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and 1.0% above one-month libor, but not less than zero, and the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero, each as more fully described in the credit facility agreement. fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit and a ticking fee based on the undrawn term loan commitments until the earlier of september 30, 2015 and the date of the second term loan draw. we, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum debt to ebitda ratio (as defined in the credit facility agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) consolidated ebitda to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all debt (as defined in the credit facility agreement) and loss on sale of accounts receivable. in addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc.; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc. of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; limitation upon use of proceeds; compliance with laws, etc.; payment of taxes, etc.; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc.; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc.; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements.
during fiscal year 2015, we borrowed $5.7 billion against the revolving credit facility under multiple draws and repaid $5.7 billion under multiple payments. on september 22, 2015, we borrowed $500.0 million against the term loan facility.
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, a foreign subsidiary of the company entered into an uncommitted credit facility to finance its growth and any corresponding working capital needs. the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $100.0 million with interest charged at a rate of libor plus 1.7%.
(f)                           during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, we entered into a master lease agreement with a variable interest entity (the vie) whereby we sell to and subsequently lease back from the vie up to $60.0
million in certain machinery and equipment for a period of up to five years. in connection with this transaction, we hold a variable interest in the vie, which was designed to hold debt obligations payable to third-party creditors. the proceeds from such debt obligations are utilized to finance the purchase of the machinery and equipment that is then leased by us. we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. therefore, we consolidate the financial statements of the vie and eliminate all intercompany transactions. at august 31,2015, the vie had approximately $28.5 million of total assets, of which approximately $28.0 million was comprised of a note receivable due from us, and approximately $27.8 million of total liabilities, of which approximately $27.8 million were debt obligations to the third-party creditors (as the vie has utilized approximately $27.8 million of the $60.0 million debt obligation capacity). the third-party creditors have recourse to our general credit only in the event that we default on our obligations under the terms of the master lease agreement. in addition, the assets held by the vie can be used only to settle the obligations of the vie.

in addition to the loans described above, at august 31, 2015, we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs. these additional loans total approximately $2.6 million, of which $1.8 million are denominated in euros, $0.5 million are denominated in russian rubles and $0.3 million are denominated in u.s. dollars.
(g)   during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, we acquired various capital lease obligations in connection with the acquisition of nypro.

(h)   this amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the 7.750% senior notes. for further discussion of our fair value hedges, see note 13  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements

under our 7.750%, 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, we are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and/or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). we are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of our 7.750%, 8.250%, 5.625% or 4.700% senior notes upon a change of control repurchase event.
the asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants. the north american asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio of the credit facility. the foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. at august 31, 2015 and 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and our securitization programs.
53
uses at august 31, 2015, we had approximately $914.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $773.4 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
as of august 31, 2015, however, we intend to repatriate the nypro pre-acquisition undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $178.4 million to our u.s. operations. therefore, we continue to record a deferred tax liability of approximately $80.1 million based on the anticipated u.s. income taxes of the repatriation. we repatriated $100.0 million of current year foreign earnings to our u.s. operations during fiscal year 2015, which had no income statement impact due to the u.s. current year operating loss and the u.s. valuation allowance. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.

we have increased our capital expenditures in an effort to accelerate growth and currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our capital expenditures, which do not include any amounts spent on acquisitions, will be in the range of $800.0 million to $1.0 billion, principally for capacity and infrastructure; investments in our dms operations, specifically our mobility, healthcare, packaging and consumer lifestyles businesses; and to support ongoing business in the ems segment. additionally, our capital expenditures will be used to expand our capabilities and invest in new non-traditional end markets. the amounts used to fund such capital expenditures will not be available to be deployed elsewhere by us. we believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
our 7.750% senior notes of $312.0 million will mature within the next twelve months. we believe that our cash on hand and available borrowing under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund the payment of the 7.750% senior notes. however, we may seek to access public or private debt markets to fund the payment of the 7.750% senior notes.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization. we repurchased 2.0 million shares for approximately $40.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding of the $100.0 million authorized by our board of directors.

on october 16, 2014, january 21, 2015, april 15, 2015 and july 16, 2015, our board of directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share to shareholders of record as of november 14, 2014, february 13, 2015, may 15, 2015 and august 14, 2015, respectively. of the total cash dividend declared on october 16, 2014 of $16.0 million, $15.5 million was paid on december 1, 2014. the remaining $0.5 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on january 21, 2015 of $16.0 million, $15.5 million was paid on march 2, 2015. the remaining $0.5 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on april 15, 2015 of $16.0 million, $15.5 million was paid on june 1, 2015. the remaining $0.5 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. of the total cash dividend declared on july 16, 2015 of $16.0 million, $15.5 million was paid on september 1, 2015. the remaining $0.5 million is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
our $200.0 million north american asset-backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017, and our $175.0 million foreign asset-backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on may 1, 2018. we may be unable to renew either of these programs. the $450.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was amended during

the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 and is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2015, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $450.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement will be automatically extended each year until august 31, 2017, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. the $150.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that is subject to expiration on august 31, 2016 (as the agreement was extended on august 31, 2015). the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2015, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement will be automatically extended each year until november 1, 2018, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables under such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment.
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. see risk factors  our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.

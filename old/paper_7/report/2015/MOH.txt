non-gaap financial measures we use the following non-gaap financial measures as supplemental metrics in evaluating our financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods. for these reasons, management believes such measures are useful supplemental measures to investors in comparing our performance and the performance of other companies in the health care industry. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not substitutes for or superior to, gaap measures.
the first of these non-gaap measures is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda. the following table reconciles net income, which we believe to be the most comparable gaap measure, to ebitda. the increases in ebitda for both 2015 over 2014, and 2014 over 2013, were due primarily to increased net income and income taxes. the increases for both of these items are described below in results of operations, in the components of net income.

________________________
(1)   beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we revised the calculation of adjusted net income, continuing operations. we no longer subtract "depreciation, and amortization of capitalized software" and "share-based compensation" from net income, continuing operations to arrive at adjusted net income, continuing operations. we have made this change to better reflect how we evaluate financial performance, make financing and business decisions, and forecast and plans for future periods. all periods presented conform to this presentation.
(2)   effective january 1, 2016, we will no longer exclude amortization of convertible notes and lease financing obligations from our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share. we made this change because various capital transactions that we completed in 2015 reduced our relative reliance on convertible notes and lease financing as sources of capital. we believe that this change will enhance the comparability of these non-gaap measures with the corresponding non-gaap measures used by our competitors.
results of operations, continuing operations as described above, as of december 31, 2015, we changed our reporting structure as a result of the pathways acquisition in november 2015. the following table presents gross margin as the appropriate earnings measure for our reportable segments, based on how our chief operating decision maker currently reviews results, assesses performance, and allocates resources.
gross margin for our health plans segment is referred to as "medical margin," and for our molina medicaid solutions and other segments, as "service margin." medical margin represents the actual dollars earned by the health plans segment after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue. the medical care ratio represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. one of the key metrics used to assess the performance of the health plans segment is the medical care ratio; therefore, the underlying medical margin is the most important measure of earnings reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. the service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue.

health plans segment premium revenue. our health plans segment derives its revenue, in the form of premiums, chiefly from medicaid contracts with the states in which our health plans operate, and, to a lesser degree, from medicare contracts entered into with the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms), a federal government agency.
2015 compared with 2014
in 2015, a 42% increase in membership and a 5% increase in revenue pmpm resulted in increased premium revenue of 47%, or over $4.2 billion, when compared with 2014.
enrollment growth was primarily due to increased medicaid expansion, marketplace and integrated medicare-medicaid plan (mmp) enrollment, and the start-up of the puerto rico health plan in april 2015.
2014 compared with 2013
in 2014, premium revenue increased 46% over 2013, due to a 28% increase in membership, and an 18% increase in revenue pmpm.
enrollment growth was primarily due to medicaid expansion program membership added as a result of the affordable care act, and membership added at our south carolina and illinois health plans. higher pmpm premium revenue was primarily the result of the inclusion of long-term services and supports (ltss) benefits in various medicaid managed care programs in california, florida, illinois, new mexico, and ohio.
premiums by program. the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs. the following table sets forth the ranges of premiums paid to our state health plans by program, on a per-member per-month basis for the year ended december 31, 2015. the "consolidated" column represents the weighted-average amounts for our total membership by program.

medical care costs. our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date. see "critical accounting estimates" below, and item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "medical claims and benefits payable," for further information on how we estimate such liabilities.
2015 compared with 2014
our medical margin increased nearly 53% in 2015 over 2014, and our consolidated medical care ratio decreased to 89.1% in 2015 from 89.5% in 2014.
2014 compared with 2013
although medical margin increased nearly 20% in 2014 over 2013, our consolidated medical care ratio increased to 89.5% in 2014 from 87.1% in 2013.
the medical care ratio increased substantially in 2014 as a result of three developments:
•   much of our revenue growth has come from participation in medicaid programs covering ltss. percentage profit margins for ltss benefits are generally lower than percentage profit margins for acute medical benefits.
•   increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends.
•   lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors in some of our state medicaid contracts is resulting in counterproductive outcomes. in some instances, givebacks due to profitable performance in one program cannot be offset against losses in other programs.

individual health plan analysis
2015 compared with 2014
california. premium revenue grew $677 million, or 44%, in 2015 compared with 2014, the result of higher membership. overall, enrollment on a member-month basis increased 31% in 2015 compared with 2014. increased premium revenue was also driven by a 15% increase in premium revenue pmpm, which was the result of the higher relative premium revenue pmpm among those programs experiencing enrollment growth (medicaid expansion and mmp); and the addition of long-term care benefits to some of the california health plan's medicaid membership. the medical care ratio increased to 87.6% in 2015, from 83.3% in 2014. during 2014, the plan benefited from the recognition of approximately $23 million in premium revenue and medical margin that related to 2013, as a result of certain programmatic changes implemented by the state of california. absent this benefit, the medical care ratio of the california plan would have been 84.6% in 2014.
florida. premium revenue grew to $1,199 million in 2015, from $439 million in 2014, due to increased marketplace membership. the medical care ratio decreased to 90.2% in 2015, from 95.5% in 2014, due to the lower medical care ratio of the marketplace membership more than offsetting an increase in the medical care ratio for the medicaid program.
illinois. premium revenue grew to $397 million in 2015, from $153 million in 2014, due to significant membership growth in late 2014. the medical care ratio increased to 92.3% in 2015, from 91.7% in 2014.
michigan. premium revenue grew $286 million, or 37%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to increased medicaid expansion membership and the startup of the mmp program. the medical care ratio of 84.6% for 2015 was unchanged from 2014.
new mexico. premium revenue grew $161 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to substantial increases in membership in all medicaid programs. the medical care ratio decreased to 89.4% in 2015, from 92.6% in 2014, due to improved profitability for the abd and medicaid expansion programs.
ohio. premium revenue grew $481 million, or 31%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to growth in membership within the medicaid expansion, and mmp programs. the medical care ratio decreased to 84.4% in 2015, from 86.0% in 2014, due to lower medical care ratios in these newer programs, as well as abd.
puerto rico. the puerto rico health plan began serving members on april 1, 2015, and finished the year with a medical care ratio of 89.1%. see further discussion below, under financial condition, regarding the commonwealth of puerto rico.
49
south carolina. the medical care ratio decreased to 79.8% in 2015, from 84.7% in 2014. we believe that medical care ratios below 80% are not sustainable over time, and that the performance of the south carolina health plan in 2014 is more representative of its likely long-term performance than are its financial results for 2015.
texas. premium revenue grew $643 million, or 49%, in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the addition of abd members receiving nursing facility benefits effective march 1, 2015, and the start-up of the texas mmp program on that date. the medical care ratio increased to 92.3% in 2015, from 90.8% in 2014, primarily as a result of lower percentage margins on premiums to support nursing home services. as previously disclosed, we are unable to recognize certain quality related revenue in texas because we do not have historical information, clear definitions, and clarity around minimum standards.
utah. the medical care ratio of the utah health plan decreased to 90.6% in 2015, from 92.2% in 2014, primarily due to improved financial performance of the plan's medicare program.
washington. premium revenue grew $297 million, or 23%, in 2015 when compared with 2014, primarily due to growth in medicaid expansion membership. the medical care ratio decreased to 91.7% in 2015, from 93.4% in 2014, as a lower medical care ratio for the abd program more than offset a higher medical care ratio in the tanf and medicaid expansion programs.
wisconsin. premium revenue grew $105 million, or 67%, in 2015 compared with 2014 as a result of increased marketplace enrollment. the medical care ratio decreased to 82.4% in 2015, from 86.8% in 2014, primarily as a result of improvement in the financial performance of the wisconsin health plan's medicaid program.
2014 compared with 2013
california. the medical care ratio for the california health plan decreased significantly to 83.3% in 2014 from 88.9% in 2013. additionally, medical margin improved $171 million when compared with 2013. this improvement was the result of higher enrollment, primarily due to the addition of approximately 107,000 medicaid expansion members; and premium increases effective october 1, 2013 (2.5%), and july 1, 2014 (5.5%). during 2014, the plan benefited from the recognition of approximately $23 million in premium revenue and medical margin that related to 2013 as a result of certain programmatic changes implemented by the state of california. in 2013, the plan recognized approximately $32 million of premium revenue related to 2012 and earlier years as a result of retroactive rate increases from the state of california. the plan served its first mmp members in 2014.
florida. due to the re-procurement undertaken by the florida agency for health care administration starting in 2014, the florida health plan transitioned many of its members to other health plans in the second quarter of 2014, and then added approximately 105,000 members in the second half of 2014, both from the addition of new service areas and through acquisitions. although revenue increased approximately 66% at the plan for the year ended december 31, 2014, when compared with 2013, profitability fell in 2014. the higher medical care costs were the result of 1) the assumption of risk for ltss benefits for certain members effective december 2013 (as noted above percentage profit margins for ltss benefits are generally less than those for other benefits); and 2) our inability to recognize revenue related to a rate increase effective september 1, 2014, as a result of those rates not being finalized prior to year end.
illinois. the medical care ratio for the illinois health plan decreased to 91.7% in 2014, from 96.9% in 2013. the plan experienced significant growth in 2014; enrollment increased approximately 96,000 members overall, with 78,000 members added in the fourth quarter alone. this growth occurred primarily within the traditional tanf program, and to a lesser degree within the medicaid expansion program. the illinois health plan served its first mmp members in 2014.
michigan. the medical care ratio of the michigan health plan was consistent year over year, at 84.6% in 2014, compared with 84.4% in 2013.
new mexico. premium revenue at the new mexico health plan increased 141% for 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of the addition of medicaid behavioral health and ltss benefits effective january 1, 2014, and the addition of approximately 54,000 medicaid expansion members during the course of 2014. the medical care ratio of the plan increased to 92.6% in 2014, from 86.1% in 2013. the higher medical care ratio was the result of: 1) the assumption of risk for ltss benefits effective january 1, 2014; and 2) premium rates effective january 1, 2014 that did not keep pace with the increase in medical costs in 2014.
ohio. the medical care ratio of the ohio health plan increased to 86.0% in 2014, from 84.2% in 2013, primarily due to the increase in medicaid expansion enrollment (which is incurring a medical care ratio slightly in excess of the plan's traditional experience), and the initiation of the ohio mmp.
south carolina. the south carolina health plan began serving members on january 1, 2014, and finished the year with a medical care ratio of 84.7%.
texas. financial performance at the texas health plan declined in 2014, when compared with 2013. the medical care ratio of the texas health plan increased to 90.8% in 2014, from 86.4% in 2013. our inability to recognize a portion of the plan's quality
50
revenue reduced income before taxes by approximately $26 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the year ended december 31, 2014. approximately $20 million of this amount is related to measures for which we lack sufficient information to calculate our compliance. removing quality revenue and profit-sharing adjustments would have resulted in a medical care ratio of approximately 88% in 2014 and 86% in 2013.
utah. the medical care ratio of the utah health plan increased to 92.2% in 2014, from 83.4% in 2013, due to deteriorating margins for both medicaid and medicare products.
washington. financial performance at the washington health plan declined in 2014, when compared with 2013.the medical care ratio of the plan increased to 93.4% in 2014, compared with 88.0% in 2013, primarily due to the high cost of medical services relative to revenue for members served under the state's program for abd members. the plan added approximately 102,000 medicaid expansion members in 2014. the plan received a blended rate increase of approximately 3% effective january 1, 2015. for the plan's abd membership, the rate increase effective january 1, 2015 was 11%.
wisconsin. the medical care ratio of the wisconsin health plan increased to 86.8% in 2014, compared with 79.7% in 2013.
molina medicaid solutions segment
2015 compared with 2014
service revenue declined $15 million in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to an extension of the idaho contract under which we are now amortizing certain deferred revenues over a longer term. service margin was consistent between 2015 and 2014, with 2015 showing a $2 million increase.
2014 compared with 2013
service margin improved $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with 2013, primarily the result of increased revenues due to higher medicaid transaction volumes and lower cost of services overall.
other segment our other segment includes other businesses, such as our pathways behavioral health and social services provider, that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment as defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as well as corporate amounts not allocated to other reportable segments. the other segment service margin for the year ended december 31, 2015, was insignificant.
consolidated expenses general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 8.1% of revenue in 2015, from 7.9% in 2014, primarily the result of dramatic growth in our marketplace membership. excluding marketplace broker and exchange fees from both years, the general and administrative expense ratio decreased to 7.5% in 2015 from 7.9% in 2014.
general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.9% of revenue in 2014, from 10.1% in 2013. the significant decline in the ratio of general and administrative expenses relative to total revenue was primarily the result of improved leverage of fixed administrative expenses over higher total revenue.
premium tax expense. the premium tax ratio (premium tax expense as a percentage of premium revenue plus premium tax revenue) decreased to 2.9% in 2015, from 3.2% in 2014. this decrease was primarily due to the current year increase in mmp revenues, which are not subject to premium taxes.
the premium tax ratio increased to 3.2% in 2014, from 2.7% in 2013. in june 2014, the state of michigan instituted a 6% use tax on medical premiums. that state agreed to fund this tax through rate increases; as a result, we recorded approximately $30 million in additional premium revenue in 2014, as well as corresponding premium tax expense.
health insurer fee (hif) revenue and expenses. for our medicaid program, actuarial standards require that we be reimbursed by state medicaid agencies for both the expense associated with the hif and the absence of tax deductibility for that expense. during 2015, we secured full reimbursement for our expenses under the hif (including the absence of tax deductibility) and as a result hif revenue, as a percentage of premium revenue, increased to 2.0% in 2015, from 1.3% in 2014. during 2015, we recognized approximately $20 million of hif premium revenue meant to reimburse us for the cost of hif expense recognized in 2014. health insurer fee expenses, as a percentage of premium revenue, were 1.2% in 2015, compared with 1.0% in 2014.
in addition, both hif revenue and expenses increased over the prior year proportionally to the increase in the total hif tax base, which is assessed to all insurers. this base increased to $11.3 billion in 2015, from $8.0 billion in 2014. refer to "liquidity and capital resources-financial condition" below, for further discussion of the hif.

interest expense. interest expense increased to $66 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $57 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was due primarily to our issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (5.375% notes) due november 15, 2022, in the fourth quarter of 2015. for further details regarding this transaction, please refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 12, "debt."
interest expense increased to $57 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with $52 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due primarily to our 3.75% notes exchange transaction and related issuance of 1.625% notes in 2014, and lease financing transactions executed in 2013. for further details regarding these transactions, please refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 12, "debt."
interest expense includes non-cash interest expense relating to the amortization of the discount on our long-term debt obligations, which amounted to $30 million, $27 million and $23 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
we expect interest expense to continue to increase in the future due to interest on the 5.375% notes which were issued in november 2015.
income taxes. the provision for income taxes in continuing operations is recorded at an effective rate of 55.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with 53.8% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the effective tax rate for 2015 is higher than 2014 primarily as a result of certain discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014 that were not recurring in 2015.
the provision for income taxes in continuing operations was recorded at an effective rate of 53.8% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with 44.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is primarily due to the nondeductible health insurer fee in 2014 that did not exist in 2013.

liquidity and capital resources introduction we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related health care services. a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of 10 years or less (excluding variable rate securities, for which interest rates are periodically reset) and that the average maturity be three years or less. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels. as of december 31, 2015, a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities, and our investments consisted primarily of investment-grade debt securities. all of our investments are classified as current assets, except for our restricted investments, which are classified as non-current assets. our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and u.s. treasury securities.
investment income increased to $18 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase in invested assets. our annualized portfolio yields for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 0.5%, and for both years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, was 0.4%.
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase. we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our unregulated parent company in the form of dividends, when and as permitted by applicable regulations, for general corporate use. we received $125 million in dividends from our regulated health plan subsidiaries, and $17 million in dividends from our unregulated subsidiaries during 2015. we did not receive any dividends from our regulated health plan subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2014, because significant growth across all of our health plans necessitated that the plans retain their cash to meet increasing net worth requirements. see further discussion in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 19, "commitments and contingencies," under the subheading "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions," and note 22, "condensed financial information of registrant," under "note c - dividends and capital contributions."

operating activities. cash provided by operating activities was $1,125 million in 2015 compared with $1,060 million in 2014, an increase of $65 million. this increase was due primarily to increased net income of $81 million, and collection of premiums receivable at our california health plan in the first quarter of 2015. these sources of cash were partially offset by:
•   a decrease in amounts due to government agencies of $268 million, primarily due to a fourth quarter 2015 medicaid expansion-related payment to the state of washington's medicaid authority of $247 million. changes in this account
53
relate primarily to health plans segment programs that contain medical cost floors or medical cost corridors. under such programs, a portion of certain medicaid, medicare, and marketplace premiums received by our health plans may be returned if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs; and
•   the change in medical claims and benefits payable, which resulted in the use of $49 million, primarily because membership and related medical costs grew at a higher rate in 2014 than in 2015, resulting in a lower year-over-year change in 2015.
in 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $1,060 million compared with $190 million for 2013, an increase of $870 million. this increase was primarily due to a $442 million increase in amounts due to government agencies because of a significant increase in amounts accrued for medical cost floor contract provisions, primarily associated with our medicaid expansion membership. in addition, medical claims and benefits payable increased $356 million due to significant membership growth in 2014.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities increased to $1,420 million in 2015, compared with $536 million in 2014, an increase of $884 million. this increase was due in part to higher purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities, amounting to $477 million, a result of cash generated from 2015 financing activities, described below.
in addition, cash paid for business acquisitions increased $406 million. as described in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1 ,"basis of presentation," we closed several business acquisitions in 2015. additionally, we announced several health plans acquisitions in 2015 that did not close until january 1, 2016. because the closing dates for these acquisitions fell on january 1, 2016, a holiday, approximately $101 million was recorded to prepaid expenses and other assets as of december 31, 2015, for purchase price amounts funded in december 2015. such amounts are reported in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
in 2014, cash used in investing activities was $536 million, comparable with $543 million in 2013.
financing activities. cash provided by financing activities was $1,085 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from our fiscal 2015 offerings of 5.375% notes, amounting to $689 million, and common stock, amounting to $373 million. in 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $79 million, which included primarily $123 million net proceeds from our fiscal 2014 offering of 1.625% notes, partially offset by $50 million paid to settle contingent consideration liabilities associated with our 2013 business acquisitions. in 2013, net proceeds from our 1.125% notes offering and lease financing transactions provided $623 million, which was partially offset by $53 million used to purchase treasury stock and $88 million to repay debt.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, at december 31, 2015, our working capital was $1,484 million compared with $1,028 million at december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2015, our cash and investments amounted to $4,241 million, compared with $2,666 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2014.
regulatory capital. our health plans, which are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states, are subject to state laws and regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state. regulators in some states may also attempt to enforce capital requirements upon us that require the retention of net worth in excess of amounts formally required by statute or regulation. such statutes, regulations and informal capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us.
based upon current statutes and regulations, the net assets in these subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $1,229 million at december 31, 2015, and $859 million at december 31, 2014. because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by the parent company - molina healthcare, inc. such cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $612 million and $203 million as of december 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
debt ratings. our 5.375% notes are rated "bb" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a significant downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs.
health insurer fee. effective january 1, 2014, the aca requires most health plans to pay a fee based on premium revenue (the health insurer fee, or hif). the hif is not tax deductible. actuarial standards require that states reimburse us for the hif we incur related to medicaid revenue, in addition to paying us a "tax gross up" to compensate us for incremental income taxes we pay because the hif is not tax deductible. during 2015, we secured full reimbursement for our expenses under the hif.

(1)   amounts in the table include our estimate of the full economic impact of the excise tax including premium tax and the income tax effect.
future sources and uses of liquidity shelf registration statement. we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. specific information regarding the terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.
credit facility. in june 2015, we entered into an unsecured $250 million revolving credit facility (credit facility). borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or an adjusted london interbank offered rate (libor), plus in each case the applicable margin. the credit facility has a term of five years and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on june 12, 2020. subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions, we may increase the credit facility to up to $350 million. our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. as of december 31, 2015, outstanding letters of credit amounting to $6 million reduced the borrowing capacity to $244 million, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.

announced acquisitions. as described in item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 1, "basis of presentation," we announced several health plans acquisitions in 2015 that did not close until january 1, 2016. because the closing dates for these acquisitions fell on january 1, 2016, a holiday, approximately $101 million was recorded to prepaid expenses and other assets as of december 31, 2015, for purchase price amounts funded in december 2015. such amounts are reported in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. the total aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions amounted to approximately $115 million.
convertible senior notes. in february 2013, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% cash convertible senior notes due january 15, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. we refer to these notes as our 1.125% notes. in september 2014, we issued $302 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes due august 14, 2044, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. we refer to these notes as our 1.625% notes. as of december 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 1.125% notes and our 1.625% notes was $550 million and $302 million, respectively. both our 1.125% notes and our 1.625% notes are convertible into cash prior to their respective maturity dates under certain circumstances, one of which relates to the closing price of our common stock over a specified period. we refer to this conversion trigger as the stock price trigger. the 1.125% notes met the stock price trigger in the quarter ended december 31, 2015, and are convertible to cash through at least march 31, 2016. because the 1.125% notes may be converted into cash within 12 months, the $448 million carrying amount is reported in current portion of long-term debt as of december 31, 2015. in addition, holders of our 1.625% notes may convert their notes into cash during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $75.51 per share. the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange on february 23, 2016 was $62.28 per share. as of december 31, 2015, our 1.625% notes were not convertible. if conversion requests are received, the settlement of the notes must be paid primarily in cash pursuant to the terms of the relevant indentures.
for economic reasons related to the trading market for our 1.125% notes, we believe that the amount of the notes that may be converted over the next twelve months, if any, will not be significant. however, if the trading market for our 1.125% notes becomes closed or restricted due to market turmoil or other reasons such that the notes cannot be traded, or if the trading price of our 1.125% notes, which normally trade at a marginal premium to the underlying composite stock-and-interest economic value, no longer includes that marginal premium, holders of our 1.125% notes may elect to convert the notes to cash. as of december 31, 2015, we had sufficient available cash, combined with borrowing capacity available under our credit facility, to fund such conversions.
states' budgets. from time to time the states in which our health plans operate may delay premium payments. for example, the state of illinois is currently operating without a budget for its fiscal year ending june 30, 2016. as of december 31, 2015, our illinois health plan served approximately 98,000 members, and recognized premium revenue of approximately $397 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. as of february 23, 2016, illinois is current with its premium payments.
in another example, the commonwealth of puerto rico has reported that it may lack sufficient resources to fund all necessary governmental programs including health care-related programs, as well as meet its debt obligations for its fiscal year ending june 30, 2016. our puerto rico health plan became operational on april 1, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the plan served approximately 348,000 members and recognized premium revenue of approximately $192 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, or approximately $64 million per month. as of february 23, 2016, the commonwealth continues to pay us weekly for current membership.
it is the practice of the commonwealth to pay us for eligible members only after those members have been assigned to us, and our plan has sent electronic confirmation of the receipt of eligibility. particularly in the early stages of our contract with puerto rico, the plan's confirmation of eligibility of certain members was not accepted by the commonwealth as a result of various technical issues. the plan has continued to pay for medical services for all members in question, but the commonwealth is withholding payment of approximately $12 million of premium revenue related to those members. we believe we have a valid claim to all of the premiums withheld and we are in discussions with the commonwealth regarding this matter.
it has been our practice in the past, and will remain so in the future, to continue to serve our members and pay health care providers for services rendered in circumstances where state (or commonwealth) governments are temporarily unable to pay us, so long as we continue to believe that such state (or commonwealth) governments will ultimately pay us.

critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates. our most significant accounting estimates relate to:
•   health plans segment medical claims and benefits payable (see discussion below).
•   health plans segment contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•   health plans segment quality incentives. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•   molina medicaid solutions segment revenue and cost recognition. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 2, "significant accounting policies."

(1)   "other" medical claims and benefits payable include amounts payable to certain providers for which we act as an intermediary on behalf of various state agencies without assuming financial risk. such receipts and payments do not impact our consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded non-risk provider payables relating to such intermediary arrangements of approximately $167 million, $119 million and $151 million, respectively.
the determination of our liability for medical claims and benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period. such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management.
as a result, the determination of our liability for medical claims and benefits payable is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date, as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date. such medical care cost liabilities include, among other items, unpaid fee-for-service claims, capitation payments owed providers, unpaid pharmacy invoices, and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid. we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates.
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee-for-service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us. these fee-for-service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid (ibnp). our ibnp, as reported on our balance sheet, represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date. we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors. as indicated in the table above, our estimated ibnp liability represented $1,191 million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of $1,685 million as of december 31, 2015.
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp, a further provision for adverse
57
claims deviation, and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date. the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates.
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier, we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid, adjusted for estimated completion factors. completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date, based on historical payment patterns.
the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2015 that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2015, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date, actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability, given the inherent delay between the patient/physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment. for these months of service, we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates. these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense, utilization patterns, authorized services, and other relevant factors. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2015 that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated. an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

the following per-share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 37%, and 56 million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2015. assuming a hypothetical 1% change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december 31, 2015, net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would increase or decrease by approximately $37 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. assuming a hypothetical 1% change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december 31, 2015, net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would increase or decrease by approximately $21 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. the corresponding figures for a 5% change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be $183 million, or $3.29 per diluted share, and $106 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, respectively.
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component, and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income. when completion factors are overestimated, trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated. both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income. likewise, when completion factors are underestimated, trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated, creating an understatement of net income. in other words, errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction. if completion factors were overestimated by 1%, resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately $37 million, it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated, resulting in an additional overstatement of net income.

after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates, we then compute an additional liability, once again using actuarial techniques, to account for adverse deviation in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for. we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims deviation. the provision for adverse claims deviation is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp. it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment, the relative magnitude or severity of claims, known outbreaks of disease such as influenza, our entry into new geographical markets, our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind or disabled, changes to state-controlled fee schedules upon which a large proportion of our provider payments are based, modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices, and increasing medical costs. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states, we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims deviation.
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date.
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial model accordingly.
on a monthly basis, we review and update our estimated ibnp and the methods used to determine that liability. any adjustments, if appropriate, are reflected in the period known. while we believe our current estimates are adequate, we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported, and may be required to do so again in the future. any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made.
in our judgment, the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination. specifically, completion factors are developed over long periods of time, and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices. trended pmpm cost estimates, while affected by the same factors, will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. as discussed above, however, errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors, and vice versa. in such circumstances, errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities (and therefore medical care costs) in the same direction.
refer to item 8 of this form 10-k, notes to consolidated financial statements, in note 11, "medical claims and benefits payable," for additional information regarding the specific factors used to determine our changes in estimates of ibnp for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable from continuing and discontinued operations combined for the periods indicated. the amounts presented for "components of medical care costs related to: prior periods" represent the amount by which our original estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period were more than the actual amount of the liability based on information (principally the payment of claims) developed since that liability was first reported.

contractual obligations in the table below, we present our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015. some of the amounts included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material noncancelable commitments.

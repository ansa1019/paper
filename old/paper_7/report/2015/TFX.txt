item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives. in addition, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position.
on february 23, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan that involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately $34 million to $44 million, of which, we expect approximately $21 million to $23 million to be incurred in 2016 and most of the balance will be incurred prior to the end of 2018. we estimate that $27 million to $31 million of the aggregate pre-tax charges will result in future cash outlays, of which, we expect approximately $6 million to $8 million will be made in 2016 and most of the balance will be made prior to the end of 2018. additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $13 million to $17 million, of which, $3 million to $5 million will be made in 2016. we currently expect to achieve annualized savings of $12 million to $16 million once the plan is fully implemented, and currently expect to realize plan-related savings beginning in 2017. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs, see "restructuring and other impairment charges" under "results of operations" below.
during 2015, we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement our anesthesia, surgical and vascular product portfolios, as well as our asia segment. in 2014, we completed acquisitions of businesses to complement our asia segment and our surgical product portfolio. the total fair value of consideration for the 2015 and 2014 acquisitions was $96.5 million and $66.3 million, respectively. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the acquisitions.
change in reporting segments effective april 1, 2015, we reorganized certain of our businesses to better leverage our resources. as a result, we realigned our operating segments. specifically, the anesthesia/respiratory north america operating segment was divided into two operating segments, anesthesia north america and respiratory north america. additionally, the businesses comprising the former specialty operating segment (which was not a reportable segment and, therefore, was included in the "all other" category in the presentation of segment information) were transferred to the anesthesia north america, vascular north america and respiratory north america operating segments. as a result of the operating segment changes described above, we have the following six reportable operating segments: vascular north america, anesthesia north america, surgical north america, emea, asia and oem. in connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which, effective april 1, 2015, include, among others, the respiratory north america operating segment, in the "all other" category. all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect these changes. additionally, because this change affected our reporting units, we performed goodwill impairment analyses as of the april 1, 2015 effective date for the new reporting units by comparing the fair value of the reporting units, including goodwill, to their carrying values. the impairment analyses performed included the reallocation of the goodwill balances among the reporting units to reflect the changes described above. we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses.

health care reform in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. the legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourages patient outcome driven results. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage, statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction.
in addition, the affordable care act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded medical device excise taxes of $10.2 million, $12.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively, which is included are selling, general and administrative expenses. as a result of the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016, the excise tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017.
global economic conditions global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities including, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the consequences of economic conditions, other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
in recent years, hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. more recently, the economic environment has improved somewhat, but has not returned to pre-recession levels, and challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 95% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change. conversely, our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered.
europe continues to contend with considerable government debt and annual deficits, high levels of unemployment and the risk of deflation. these factors have resulted in austerity programs that have affected the healthcare sector in a number of european countries resulting in delays in elective surgeries. it is likely that funding for publicly funded healthcare institutions will continue to be affected if governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs. the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe, most notably greece, spain, portugal and italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us. the slowdown has continued to affect the timing of collections from these customers.
in asia, governments are making additional efforts to manage the cost of healthcare, as economic conditions weaken somewhat in the region as a result of slowing growth rates in china. we are experiencing an increasing trend of government driven price management and reimbursement controls, particularly in china, japan and indonesia. in china, there is also a governmental initiative to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market. moreover, many countries, including china, have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements, and as a result, we expect longer, more costly, and more complicated, regulatory approval processes in these countries.
34
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices. although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products that we have sold for 36 months or less, and "existing products" are products that we have sold for more than 36 months. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects, for the first 12 months following the acquisition of a distributor, the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel. to the extent an acquired distributor had pre-acquisition sales of products other than ours, the impact of the post-acquisition sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses.
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
revenues
2015                             2014                  2013
(dollars in millions)
net revenues      $1,809.7              $1,839.8              $1,696.3
comparison of 2015 and 2014
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased 1.6%, or $30.1 million, compared to the prior year. the decrease is primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $129.1 million, primarily in the emea and asia segments. the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by a net increase in sales volumes of existing products in most of our segments of $51.9 million, and a net increase in new product sales in most of our segments of $19.4 million. in addition, the decrease was further offset by sales by acquired businesses, primarily human medics co., ltd. ("human medics"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the korean market, mini-lap, a developer of micro-laparoscopic instrumentation, mayo healthcare pty limited, ("mayo healthcare"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies, primarily in the australian market, n. stenning & co. pty. ltd. ("stenning"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market, and truphatek holdings (1993) limited ("truphatek"), a manufacturer of a broad range of disposable and reusable laryngoscope devices, which generated $14.8 million, and net price increases, primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments, which generated $12.8 million.
comparison of 2014 and 2013
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 8.5%, or $143.5 million, compared to the prior year. the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to the businesses acquired during 2013 and 2014 (including vidacare; mayo healthcare; and ultimate medical pty. ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, "ultimate"), a supplier of airway management devices), which generated net revenues of $98.6 million, including $79.9 million, $16.6 million and $2.2 million generated by vidacare, mayo healthcare and ultimate, respectively. net revenues further benefited from price increases of $23.9 million, primarily in the asia, emea and surgical north america segments, new product sales of $14.8 million across most of our segments, and a net increase in sales volumes of existing products of $12.3 million, primarily in the oem, emea and vascular north america segments. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $6.2 million, lower sales volumes in the asia segment as well as in certain of the operating segments included in the "all other" category, and price reductions in the oem segment.

gross profit                $944.4              $942.4              $838.9
percentage of revenues        52.2   %            51.2   %            49.5   %
comparison of 2015 and 2014
for the year ended december 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points, or 2.0%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the 70 basis point impact of a net increase in sales of higher margin products, primarily in the surgical north america and oem segments, the 60 basis point impact of a net increase in sales volumes of existing products, primarily in the vascular north america, emea and asia segments and the 30 basis point impact of net price increases, primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments. gross margin was negatively impacted by the 80 basis point impact of net unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and costs associated with product recalls and quality issues first identified during the second quarter 2015 partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives.
comparison of 2014 and 2013
for the year ended december 31, 2014, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 170 basis points, or 3.4%, compared to the prior year. the increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased sales from higher margin vidacare products, margin increases in asia resulting from sales of mayo healthcare products, price increases in asia, emea and surgical north america, and increased sales of higher margin products, primarily in the emea and certain of the operating segments included in the "all other" category. these improvements in gross profit were partially offset by costs associated with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan, an increase in logistics and distribution costs and the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
selling, general and administrative
2015                                                               2014                2013

comparison of 2015 and 2014
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. the decrease is due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $28.5 million and a reduction in medical device excise tax of $2.5 million. these declines were partially offset by expenses associated with the 2015 acquisitions and distributors-to-direct sales conversions of $11.4 million, an increase in selling expenses of $5.4 million, primarily related to higher sales commissions, a reduction in the benefit resulting from contingent consideration liability reversals of $2.9 million and higher amortization expense of $2.6 million.
comparison of 2014 and 2013
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $76.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase is primarily due to $35.4 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses, primarily vidacare, mayo healthcare and ultimate, $13.8 million of higher sales expense, primarily related to an increase in sales commissions, higher amortization expense of $10.5 million, the majority of which relates to the amortization of vidacare intangibles, $5.4 million of higher general and administrative costs primarily due to increases in employee related expenses, higher depreciation expense of $2.2 million, resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of an administrative building and certain related assets, $1.7 million of higher it related costs primarily associated with the ongoing maintenance of enterprise resource planning software systems, partially offset by the $3.2
36
million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which caused a reduction of expenses.  in addition, the benefit from contingent consideration reserve reductions for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $4.9 million lower than the benefit realized in the year ended december 31, 2013.

comparison of 2015 and 2014
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2013 that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease is also attributable to the late stage technology acquisitions made in 2015, which supplement our organic research and development initiatives.
comparison of 2014 and 2013
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2012, including lma international n.v., hotspur technologies and semprus biosciences corp, that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013.

2015 restructuring programs during 2015, we committed to programs associated with the reorganization of certain of our businesses, as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, and shared service functions as well as the consolidation of certain of our north american facilities. we estimate that we will record aggregate pre-tax charges of $6.5 million to $8.0 million related to these programs, which represent employee termination benefits, contract termination costs and facility closure and other exit costs, and will result in future cash outlays. we began to realize savings related to these plans in 2015, and expect to achieve annualized savings of $15 million to $18 million once the restructuring plans are fully implemented. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded charges of $6.3 million and had a reserve of $3.3 million related to these programs.
2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan in april 2014, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan") that involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the
37
relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2017. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan of approximately $37 million to $44 million, of which we expect future cash outlays to constitute an estimated $26 million to $31 million. additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $24 million to $30 million under the restructuring plan. we began to realize savings related to this plan beginning in 2015, and we expect to achieve annualized savings of $28 million to $35 million once the plan is fully implemented.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, expenses related to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan decreased $3.0 million as compared to the prior year. the decrease was attributable to lower restructuring costs, primarily termination benefits, of $7.6 million (as shown above), which was partially offset by an increase in charges recorded to cost of sales, primarily for the transfer of manufacturing operations from the existing locations to the new locations of $4.6 million. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $7.8 million of capital expenditures and had cash outlays of $10.6 million, of which, $2.7 million related termination benefit payments, associated with this plan. as of december 31, 2015, we had a reserve of $7.4 million in connection with this plan, the majority of which is recorded as a current liability.
2014 european restructuring plan in 2014, we committed to a restructuring plan (the "2014 european restructuring plan"), which impacts certain administrative functions in europe and involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain of our european facilities. as of december 31, 2015, we incurred net aggregate restructuring expenses of $7.7 million in connection with the 2014 european restructuring plan. we expect to complete this plan in 2016.
other 2014 restructuring programs in june 2014, we initiated programs to consolidate locations in australia and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs. as of december 31, 2015 we incurred aggregate restructuring charges of $3.6 million as a result of these actions. these programs include employee termination benefits, contract termination costs and other exit costs. we completed these programs in 2015.
2013 restructuring programs in 2013, we initiated restructuring programs to consolidate administrative and manufacturing facilities in north america and warehouse facilities in europe and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs. as of december 31, 2015, we incurred net aggregate restructuring charges of $10.9 million. of this amount, $5.3 million relates to employee termination costs, $3.5 million relates to termination of certain distributor agreements and $2.1 million relates to facility closure and other exit costs. we completed these programs in 2015.
lma restructuring program in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international n.v. (the "lma business") in 2012, we commenced a program related to the integration of the lma business with our other businesses. the program focused on the closure of the lma business' corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution functions in north america, europe and asia. as a result of these actions, we incurred net aggregate restructuring charges of $11.3 million as of december 31, 2015. of this amount, $5.5 million related to employee termination costs, $4.9 million related to termination of certain distributor agreements and $0.9 million related to facility closure and other costs.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a net credit of $3.3 million primarily resulting from the reversal of contract termination costs due to the favorable settlement of a terminated distributor agreement. we completed this program in 2015.
other restructuring programs - prior years for the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded restructuring charges of $5.2 million, which were primarily attributable to our 2012 restructuring program. this program was initiated in 2012 to improve the effectiveness of our supply chain by consolidating our three north american warehouses into one centralized warehouse, and to lower costs and improve operating efficiencies through the termination of certain distributor agreements in europe, the closure of certain north american facilities and workforce reductions. as of december 31, 2015, we incurred aggregate restructuring charges of $6.3 million under this program, all of which were incurred prior to 2015. as of december 31,
38
2015, we had a reserve of $0.5 million related to the 2012 restructuring program. we expect to complete the program in 2016.
impairment charges there were no impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2015 or 2014.
in 2013, we recorded $7.3 million of in-process research and development ("ipr&d") charges and $3.5 million in impairment charges related to assets held for sale that had a carrying value in excess of their appraised fair value. there were no impairment charges in the years ended december 31, 2015 or 2014.

average interest rate on debt during the year      3.84   %          4.10   %          3.92   %
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year reflects the benefit of the redemption, on june 1, 2015, of our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019, which had a fixed interest rate. proceeds from our revolving credit facility, which bear a lower variable interest rate, were utilized to redeem the 2019 notes.
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year was the result of an increase of $96 million in average outstanding debt and an increase of 18 basis points in the average interest rate on outstanding debt during 2014.

loss on extinguishment of debt     $10.5           $-                 $1.3
on june 1, 2015, we prepaid the $250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes"). in addition to our prepayment of principal, we paid to the holders of the 2019 notes an $8.6 million prepayment make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. we recorded the prepayment make-whole amount and a $1.9 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt.
during 2013, we refinanced our $775 million senior credit facility, which was comprised of a $375 million term loan and a $400 million revolving credit facility, with a new $850 million senior credit facility consisting solely of a revolving credit facility. in connection with the refinancing, we recognized debt extinguishment costs of $1.3 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs resulting from the early repayment of the $375 million term loan.

effective income tax rate   3.2   %      13.0   %      13.4   %
the effective income tax rate in 2015 was 3.2% compared to 13.0% in 2014. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2015 were $7.8 million compared to $28.7 million in 2014. the effective tax rate for 2015 was impacted by a tax benefit associated with u.s. federal tax return filings, a benefit associated with legislative tax rate changes, a benefit resulting from a reduction in our u.s. reserves as a result of the conclusion of an audit and a benefit associated
39
with a reduction in the estimated deferred tax with respect to non-permanently reinvested income due to an increase in the estimated foreign tax credits available to reduce the u.s. tax on a future repatriation.
the effective income tax rate in 2014 was 13.0% compared to 13.4% in 2013. taxes on income from continuing operations in 2014 were $28.7 million compared to $23.5 million in 2013. the effective income tax rate for 2014 was impacted by a benefit from a shift in the mix of income to jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, tax benefits associated with u.s. federal tax return filings and, although to a lesser extent than in 2013, the realization of net tax benefits resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitation for u.s. state and foreign matters.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
approximately $147.4 million of our $303.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was generated in the united states, and approximately $118.6 million of our $290.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was generated in the united states. of our $338.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015, $316.0 million was held at foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary. any additional taxes could be offset, at least in part, by foreign tax credits. the amount of any taxes required to be paid, which could be significant, and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation. we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense because taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested.
we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs. however, as discussed above in "global economic conditions", although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly with respect to customers in europe. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy, spain, portugal and greece were $37.4 million and $46.9 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 7%, 8% and 8%, respectively, of total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term accounts receivable were outstanding were 204, 223 and 260 days, respectively. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, net current and long-term accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 24% and 27%, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term accounts receivable. if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers' purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2016 and future years. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.
the aggregate total fair value of consideration for the acquisitions we made in 2015 and 2014 was $96.5 million and $66.3 million, respectively. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
during 2015, we prepaid the $250 million aggregate principal outstanding on our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes"), but increased the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and securitization program by $196 million and $38.6 million, respectively. during 2014, we issued $250 million of 5.25%
44
senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), and used the $245.0 million net proceeds of the sale of the 2024 notes to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. we pay interest on the 2024 notes semi-annually on june 15 and december 15, at a rate of 5.25% per year. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our borrowings.
we have no scheduled principal payments under our borrowings until 2017. we anticipate our aggregate domestic interest payments on our borrowings for 2016 will approximate $39.3 million. we plan to utilize cash from operations, generated from both in and outside of the united states, and our revolving credit facility to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements.
our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes") are classified as a current liability because a conversion event related to the achievement of a specified market price threshold with respect to our common stock has occurred and is continuing.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases or by tender at any price or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.
see "financing arrangements" below for further information relating to our debt obligations, including the convertible notes.

comparison of 2015 and 2014
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $303.4 million during 2015 compared to $290.2 million during 2014. the $13.2 million increase is primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by an increase in contributions to pension plans of $3.3 million, an increase in income tax payments, net of refunds, of $3.2 million, an increase in payments associated with restructuring programs and other unfavorable working capital items.
the net cash outflow from the other working capital items is primarily the result of cash outflows for inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a cash inflow for accounts receivable. the net cash outflow for the purchase of inventories was $8.4 million in 2015 as compared to a $15.5 million net cash outflow in 2014. the reduction in the cash outflow is primarily due to service level improvements and the consolidation of distribution facilities associated with restructuring initiatives as well as fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct conversions. the accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash outflow was $0.1 million in 2015 as compared to cash outflow of $9.8 million in 2014. the decrease in the cash outflow is primarily a result of the timing

of vendor and employee related benefit payments as well as a $4.0 million decrease in interest payments year-over-year. the net cash inflow for accounts receivable was $0.4 million during 2015 as compared to a cash inflow of $9.4 million in 2014, which was primarily the result of increased collections in the emea region in 2014.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $154.8 million during 2015, primarily due to net payments of $93.8 million for the businesses acquired in 2015, which included nostix, llc, a developer of catheter tip confirmation systems, truphatek holdings limited and atsina surgical, llc, a developer of surgical clips, among others, and capital expenditures of $61.4 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $85.6 million during 2015, primarily resulting from repayments of outstanding debt totaling $303.8 million, including the redemption of the entire $250 million outstanding principal amount of the 2019 notes and the repayment of $50 million and $3.5 million under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, respectively. additionally, we paid $56.5 million in dividends and $8.0 million in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of mini-lap technologies, inc. we also incurred $9.0 million of debt extinguishment, issuance and amendment fees, primarily as a result of a make whole payment in connection with the redemption of the 2019 notes. these cash outflows were partially offset by $288.1 million of proceeds from borrowings, including $246.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $42.1 million of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility. in addition, we realized net cash inflows of $5.0 million from share-based compensation activity, which included proceeds from the exercise and vesting of share-based awards under our stock compensation plans and the related tax benefits, partially offset by tax withholdings that we remitted on behalf of employees who have elected to have shares withheld by us to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their share-based awards.
comparison of 2014 to 2013
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $290.2 million during 2014 compared to $231.3 million during 2013. the $58.9 million increase is primarily due to improved operating results and favorable net changes in working capital items, principally reflecting changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other current assets, as well as an $8.0 million decrease in contributions to domestic pension plans. accounts receivable decreased $9.4 million during 2014 as compared to a $1.3 million increase during 2013, primarily due to increased collections from the spanish and portuguese government and spanish regional health authorities in 2014 and increased collections in italy and greece due to government financing. additionally, there was an overall improvement in days receivables outstanding in 2014. accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $9.8 million in 2014 compared to an increase of $2.0 million in 2013, primarily due to timing of vendor and employee related benefit payments and increased compensation accruals in 2014. prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $1.4 million in 2014 compared to an increase of $5.9 million in 2013 due to timing of payments of and reductions in insurance premiums as well as fewer insurance deposits and maintenance contract payments in 2014.
the factors contributing to the increase in net cash flow from operating activities discussed above were partially offset by increased inventories of $15.5 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of $8.9 million in 2013, primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support sales growth internationally and our distributor-to-direct sales conversions in several countries, and an $8.9 million increase in tax payments, net of refunds, in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to timing of tax payments and improved operating results.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $108.1 million during 2014, reflecting net payments for businesses acquired of $45.8 million and capital expenditures of $67.6 million. the net payments for businesses acquired include the acquisition of mayo healthcare and the assets of mini-lap technologies, inc. these payments were partly offset by $5.3 million in proceeds related to the sale of certain assets that were held for sale.

cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $287.7 million during 2014, which included repayments of $480.1 million of indebtedness principally under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by proceeds from additional borrowings of $250.0 million from the sale of our 2024 notes. net cash used in financing activities also included dividend payments of $56.3 million and underwriters' discount and commission fees of $4.5 million, which were paid in connection with the sale of the 2024 notes. net cash used in financing activities were reduced by cash inflows of $7.1 million associated with proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards issued under our stock compensation plans and $5.8 million of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of those awards, which were partially offset by tax withholdings of $8.7 million remitted by the company on behalf of employees who elect to have shares withheld by the company to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their share-based awards.

fixed rate borrowings comprised 59.7% and 81.5% of total borrowings at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the reduction in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year is primarily due to our redemption of the 2019 notes and the increase in variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility.
our senior credit agreement, which relates to our $850 million revolving credit facility, contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements. our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the senior credit agreement) of not more than 4.0:1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the senior credit agreement) of not less than 3.50:1 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement and, during the six month period prior to the maturity of our convertible notes, a minimum liquidity of $400.0 million. at december 31, 2015, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.43:1 and our interest coverage ratio was 9.77:1, both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence. the obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions) by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the company and (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) secured by a pledge on substantially all of the equity interests owned by the company and each guarantor.
at december 31, 2015, we had $396.0 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately $3.8 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $850 million revolving credit facility. this facility is used principally for working capital needs and, at certain times, to help fund acquisitions. the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the
47
covenants contained in our senior credit agreement. moreover, additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect (as defined in the senior credit agreement) were to occur. notwithstanding these restrictions, we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs.  at our current level of ebitda (as defined in the senior credit agreement) for the year ended december 31, 2015, we would have been permitted $681.7 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31, 2015. moreover, additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition.
as of december 31, 2015, the outstanding principal of the 2024 notes was $250.0 million. the indenture governing the 2024 notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, and pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, subject to specified conditions. the obligations under the 2024 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries.
as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2024 notes.
our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period, and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period. at the time we issued the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes, from our economic standpoint, to $74.65. however, under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is anti-dilutive, we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement.
under the treasury stock method, changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation. the following table illustrates how changes in our stock price would affect (i) the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the warrant agreements, (iii) the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes, after applying the treasury stock method, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share ("total treasury stock method incremental shares"), (iv) the number of shares of common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the hedge agreements and (v) the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the convertible notes, exercise of the warrants and settlement of the convertible note hedge agreements:

(1)   represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under gaap.
our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible notes (approximately $79.72). since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31, 2015, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the 130% threshold described above and, accordingly, the convertible notes are classified as a current liability as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. the determination of whether or not the convertible notes are convertible under such circumstances is made each quarter until their maturity, conversion or repurchase.  consequently, the convertible notes may not be convertible in one or more future quarters if the common stock price-based conversion contingency is not satisfied in such quarters, in which case the convertible notes would again be classified as long-term debt unless another conversion event set forth in the convertible notes occurs. as of february 15, 2016, we have received conversion notices with respect to approximately $44.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes. we have elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligation, under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facility, our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.  the classification of the convertible notes as a current liability had no impact on the financial covenants under our debt agreements.
in addition, we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2015, the maximum amount available for borrowing under this facility was $6.7 million. this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $43.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.

(1)   the convertible notes, which mature in 2017, are included in payments due in less than one year because our stock price has exceeded the amount specified to enable conversion, as described in more detail in the "financing arrangements" section above. total borrowings also include $43.3 million under our securitization program. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional details regarding this program.
(2)   interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december 31, 2015.
(3)   purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions based on prices

in effect on a particular date and the approximate timing of the transactions. these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.
we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of $40.4 million and $50.9 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of $20.8 million and $33.4 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which, $7.3 million and $11.3 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration. due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities, these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
in 2015, cash contributions to all of our defined benefit pension plans were $12.8 million, and we estimate the amount of required cash contributions in 2016 will be approximately $2.4 million. due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2016 and as a result, these contributions are excluded from contractual obligations table shown above.
see notes 10, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion supplements the description of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of the accounts receivable, considering our historical collection experience with respect to the customer, length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.0 million and $8.8 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which constituted 2.9% of gross accounts receivable at december 31, 2015 and 2014.
in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years, we have measures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  such measures include, monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  in addition, with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we have measures designed to reduce our risk exposures, including reducing credit limits and requiring
50
that payments accompany orders.  with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  some of our customers, particularly in europe, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers, for the most part in greece, italy, spain and portugal. if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record the adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $11.1 million and $10.4 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we expect amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31, 2015 to be paid within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value.  factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage.
our inventory reserve was $36.5 million and $33.9 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represents 10.0% and 9.2% of gross inventories at those respective dates.
accounting for long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances, which we refer to as "triggering events," indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. triggering events include a current expectation that, more likely than not, the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or an adverse change will occur in the business employing the related assets. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involves significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names or brands and in-process research and development), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names or brands that do not have indefinite
51
lives, customer relationships and intellectual property). the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily certain trade names and trademarks, are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows, which are key elements in determining fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. we have a total of ten reporting units, nine of which have goodwill. in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. alternatively, we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the two-step impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. in the fourth quarter 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units and determined, based on our assessment that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and, therefore, concluded that goodwill was not impaired. for the three remaining reporting units with goodwill, we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test each of those reporting units through the two-step quantitative impairment test.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows (dcf) of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2015 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2014. the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter of 2015 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit. the discount rate was 10.0% for all reporting units. a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all reporting units.
52
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. under the income approach, changes in assumptions could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges.
no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2015.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of intellectual property, customer relationships, trade names and ipr&d. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test. in the fourth quarter 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment on two of our indefinite lived assets and determined that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values. for the remaining three indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method.
in connection with the quantitative impairment test, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the royalty, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset.
the fair value of ipr&d is estimated using a multi-period excess earnings model, which is a form of the income approach. this model estimates fair value by using estimated cash flows to be derived from this technology. the estimated cash flows are generated from a collection of assets, including ipr&d, but also including working capital, fixed assets and other assets. therefore, the estimated cash flows generated by these other assets are deducted, and the remaining amount (the "excess earnings") are allocated to ipr&d. key management judgments include making assumptions about the expected timing to complete the project, future cash flows based on growth rates of revenue and expense, expectations of erosion rates as a result of future replacement technology, discount rates and working capital needs.
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter 2015 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill. the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade names ranged from 4% to 5% and a royalty rate of 4% was assumed. the discount rate used to determine fair value of ipr&d was 16.5%. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the respective intangible assets. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace.

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2015. for further details on the assessment of recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets see "accounting for long-lived assets" above.
in may 2012, we acquired semprus biosciences, a biomedical research and development company that developed a polymer surface treatment technology intended to reduce thrombus related complications. as previously disclosed, we experienced difficulties with respect to the development of the semprus technology and were devoting further research and testing towards attempting to resolve the issue. as a result of these efforts, we believe we have resolved the issue and are focused on seeking regulatory approval and engaging in additional research and development efforts to achieve commercialization of this technology. despite this progress, significant challenges to commercialization of the semprus technology remain, and we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets, which could be material. as of december 31, 2015, we have recorded ipr&d intangible assets of $41.0 million related to semprus.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate                                                   expected return on plan assets                          assumed healthcare trend rate
50 basis point increase                 50 basis point decrease         50 basis point change                       1.0% increase          1.0% decrease
(dollars in millions)
net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense   $(0.4               )                            $0.4                   $1.6                                          $0.2                 $(0.2         )
projected benefit obligation                                 $(29.5              )                           $32.8                   n/a                                           $3.8                 $(3.3         )
effective december 31, 2015, the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefits to provide a more precise estimate. based on the spot rates that comprise the yield curve as of december 31, 2015, the change in method is expected to result in a decrease in the service and interest cost components for 2016 when compared to the estimates determined using the prior methodology.

share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share based compensation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $14.5 million, $12.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively.
54
accounting for contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the change in the liability's fair value in our consolidated statement of income. an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the discount rate, timing, estimated probability of achievement of the specified objectives and revenue estimates, among other factors. as of december 31, 2015, the range of undiscounted amounts the company could be required to pay under contingent consideration arrangements is between $7.0 million and $43.8 million. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we accrued $20.8 million and $33.4 million of contingent consideration, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of $4.4 million, $8.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively, resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones.
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final united states and foreign tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $103.5 million and $99.1 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination by the austrian, canadian, german and united states tax authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years. the ultimate outcomes of the examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.

new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements.

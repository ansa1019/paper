in 2015, the companys sales increased 3% as compared to 2014, with foreign currency translation reducing sales growth by 6%. in 2015, the company experienced strong demand for products and services from life science, industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers. this strength in demand was driven by double-digit sales growth in the u.s., china and india, while sales in europe, japan and the rest of the world declined due to the effect of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against substantially all currencies throughout the world. sales in europe declined 8%, where foreign currency translation reduced sales growth by 14%, japan sales decreased 11%, where foreign currency translation decreased sales by 12%, and sales in the rest of the world declined by 8%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 5%.
instrument system sales increased 3% in both 2015 and 2014 due to higher demand for lc and lc-ms instrument systems. the 2015 instrument systems sales growth was driven by demand for hplc, uplc and qda® instrument systems, as well as the newly introduced acquity® arc instrument system. recurring revenues (combined sales of chemistry consumables and services) increased 2% and 7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales. the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 6% and 2% across all products and services in 2015 and 2014, respectively. based on current foreign exchange rates, the company expects that foreign currency translation may negatively affect sales growth in 2016. acquisitions had a minimal impact on sales growth in both 2015 and 2014.
23
the companys sales growth rates by customer end-market were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation as discussed above. despite the negative effects of foreign currency translation, the companys customer end-market sales were able to grow as follows:
   sales to life science customers grew 4% and 8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. sales growth in 2015 was driven by double-digit growth in the u.s., china and india and sales growth in 2014 was positive in all regions, except japan.

                                      combined sales to industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers increased 4% in 2015 and decreased 1% in 2014. the increase in
2015 was driven by double-digit growth in the u.s., china and india, while the decline in 2014 is primarily due to weaker industrial chemical customer demand for both waters division and ta division instrument systems.

   combined global sales to governmental and academic customers decreased 5% in 2015 and increased 4% in 2014. in 2015, combined sales to governmental and academic customers grew in the u.s. and china but declined in all other regions.

operating income was $567 million in 2015, an increase of 10% as compared to 2014. this increase was primarily a result of the effect of higher sales volume achieved in 2015 being partly offset by a $56 million reduction in operating income from the adverse effects of foreign currency translation. operating income was flat in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the increase in sales volume was offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased 2014 operating profit by approximately $22 million. in addition, operating income was impacted by the following items:
   acquired in-process research and development charges of $4 million and $15 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized.

   litigation settlement provisions of $4 million in 2015.

   severance-related costs included in selling and administrative expenses of $3 million and $6 million incurred in 2015 and 2014, respectively, in connection with reductions in workforce, primarily in europe in 2015 and primarily in the u.s. in 2014.

   an impairment charge included in selling and administrative expenses of $5 million in 2014 related to a write-down in the fair value of a building held for sale in the u.k., which was offset slightly by a $2 million award received in 2014 from an arbitration settlement.

net income per diluted share was primarily affected by the following factors in 2015, 2014 and 2013:
   foreign currency translation decreased net income per diluted share by $0.59 in 2015, $0.23 in 2014 and $0.27 in 2013.

   acquired in-process research and development charges in 2015 and 2014 decreased net income per diluted share by $0.04 and $0.14, respectively.

   litigation settlement provisions in 2015 reduced net income per diluted share by $0.03.

   severance-related costs in 2015 and 2014 reduced net income per diluted share by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.

   an impairment charge in 2014 related to a building held for sale in the u.k. reduced net income per diluted share by $0.04.

                            in 2013, the company recorded a $31 million net tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations. in addition, a $3 million benefit related to the research and development tax credit (r&amp;d tax credit) for the 2012 tax year was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. these tax benefits added $0.39 per diluted share in 2013.

24
                                              the effect of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the companys share repurchase program, offset by the incremental net interest expense on borrowings to repurchase those shares, increased net income per diluted share $0.16, $0.07 and $0.11 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company plans to continue its share repurchase program in 2016.

net cash provided by operating activities was $560 million, $512 million and $485 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the $48 million increase in operating cash flow in 2015 when compared to 2014 was primarily a result of the increase in net income, as well as the timing of cash receipts from customers and the timing of payments to vendors. the $27 million increase in operating cash flow in 2014 when compared to 2013 was primarily a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers and the timing of payments to vendors.
within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $100 million, $91 million and $118 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. capital expenditures in 2013 included multi-year construction projects to accommodate future growth. the construction of the new $83 million research, manufacturing and distribution facility in wilmslow, england was completed in early 2014. during 2015 and 2014, the company made payments of $3 million and $15 million, respectively, to acquire and license intellectual property.
in november 2015, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of mpe orbur group limited and its sole operating subsidiary, midland precision equipment company, ltd. (mpe), a manufacturer of ms instrumentation components, for $12 million, net of cash acquired. mpe is a highly skilled manufacturer and former waters supplier that produces critical components that support the companys ms instrument systems. in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company acquired certain assets of its malaysian sales and service distributor for $2 million in cash. in may 2015, the company acquired the net assets of the electroforce® business of the bose corporation (electroforce), for $9 million in cash. electroforce is a manufacturer of dynamic mechanical testing systems used to characterize medical devices, biologic and engineered materials. these acquisitions are not expected to have a significant impact on the companys sales and profits in 2016.
in july 2014, the company acquired medimass research, development and service kft. and ulsp b.v. for a total of $27 million, net of cash acquired. as a result of the medimass acquisition, the company expects to incur additional costs related to commercializing new mass spectrometry-related technologies in 2016 and beyond. in 2013, the company acquired scarabaeus mess-und prodktionstechnik gmbh, nonlinear dynamics ltd., expert systems solutions s.r.l. and lasercomp inc. for a total of $41 million, net of cash acquired. the company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the waters and ta operating divisions.
in april 2015, the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement dated june 2013. the amended credit agreement provides for an increase of the revolving commitments from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion and extends the maturity of the original credit agreement from june 25, 2018 until april 23, 2020. the company plans to use future proceeds from the revolving facility for general corporate purposes. in may 2014, the companys board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $750 million of its outstanding common stock over a three-year period and authorized the extension of the may 2012 program until may 2015. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company repurchased $327 million, $329 million and $295 million of the companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under the may 2014 authorization and other previously announced programs. the company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the companys sales and profits. in addition, the company received $52 million, $74 million and $69 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the companys stock price.

in 2015, the u.s. sales growth was broad-based across all products and was driven by life science, industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers. europes sales in 2015 were broad-based across all products and customer classes, but declined as a result of the negative effects of foreign currency. china achieved strong double-digit sales growth in all product and customer classes in 2015. japans 2015 sales were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation, which decreased sales by 12%. the increase in sales in the rest of asia in 2015 was driven by life science, industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers across all product classes. sales in the rest of the world in 2015 increased to life science customers but declined across all other customer and product classes. the decline in sales in the rest of the world in 2015 was significantly attributable to a reduction in customer demand in latin america caused by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar and the weak brazilian economy.
in 2014, the u.s. sales growth was driven by an increase in lc and lc-ms instrument system sales and service sales to life science, governmental and academic customers. europes sales in 2014 were driven by lc, lc-ms and ta instrument system sales and service sales across all customer classes. chinas sales decline in 2014 can be primarily attributed to lower research-focused, higher priced instrument sales to governmentally funded customers that experienced a tightening of government spending. japans 2014 sales were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation, which decreased sales in 2014 by 8%. the increase in sales in the rest of asia in 2014 was driven by an increase in lc and lc-ms instrument system sales and service sales to life science, governmental and academic customers, primarily in india. sales in the rest of the world in 2014 were flat as increased service sales to life science, governmental and academic customers were offset by weakness in other areas.

the increase in waters instrument system sales (lc and ms technology-based) in both 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to higher sales of lc and lc-ms instrument system sales. the 2015 instrument systems sales growth was driven by demand for hplc, uplc and qda® instrument systems, as well as the newly introduced arc instrument system. chemistry consumables sales increased in both 2015 and 2014 on the uptake in acquity columns. waters division service sales increased in both 2015 and 2014 due to increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased waters division sales across all products and services by 7% and 1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the impact of the acquisitions of mpe in 2015 and medimass in 2014 was not significant to the waters division sales in 2015.
in 2015, waters division sales increased 10% in the u.s. and 8% in asia, while sales decreased 8% in europe and the rest of the world. the increase in sales in the u.s. in 2015 was across all customer classes. waters division sales in china increased 16% in 2015, but decreased 11% in japan due to the effects of foreign currency translation. waters division sales in the rest of asia increased 14% and were driven by sales to life science, industrial chemical, nutritional safety and environmental customers.
in 2014, waters division sales increased 8% in the u.s., 5% in europe, 4% in asia and 1% in the rest of the world. the increase in sales in the u.s. in 2014 was primarily driven by sales to life science, governmental and academic customers. waters division sales in china increased 1% in 2014, but decreased 4% in japan due to the effects of foreign currency translation. waters division sales in the rest of asia increased 13% and were driven by sales to life science customers in india as well as governmental and academic customers.

the increase in ta instrument system sales in 2015 was primarily attributable to tas thermal physical properties instruments. in addition, tas core thermal analysis instrument systems sales rebounded in 2015 after
27
a decrease in 2014 in comparison to stronger sales in 2013. ta service sales increased in both 2015 and 2014 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. the effect of foreign currency translation decreased tas sales by 5% and 1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. recent acquisitions added approximately 3% to tas sales in both 2015 and 2014. in 2015, ta showed sales growth in the u.s. and asia, excluding japan, but sales declined in europe, japan and the rest of the world as a result of negative foreign currency translation. tas 2014 sales increased moderately in the u.s. and europe but declined in most other regions.
gross profit gross profit increased 3% and 4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. both years benefited from increased sales volumes which were somewhat offset by negative foreign currency translation in 2014. gross profit as a percentage of sales was 58.7%, 58.5% and 58.9% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
gross profit as a percentage of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, price, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. the company expects that the impact of foreign currency translation may negatively affect gross profit in 2016, based on current exchange rates.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2015 and increased 4% in 2014. foreign currency translation reduced selling and administrative expenses by 7% in 2015. selling and administrative expenses in 2015 and 2014 were impacted by headcount additions, higher merit compensation costs and included $3 million and $6 million, respectively, of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. in 2014, the company incurred a $5 million impairment charge related to a write-down in the fair value of a building held for sale in the u.k. this building was sold in 2015 for $5 million in cash. these expenses in 2014 were offset slightly by a $2 million award received in 2014 from an arbitration settlement. selling and administrative expenses in 2013 were impacted by headcount additions and higher merit compensation, offset slightly by favorable foreign currency translation due to the weakness in the japanese yen. as a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 24.3%, 25.8% and 25.9% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased 10% and 7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. research and development expenses in both 2015 and 2014 were impacted by additional headcount, merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. in addition, research and development expenses in 2015 included a benefit from a $3 million government grant, as well as favorable effects of foreign currency translation. in 2014, the effect of foreign currency translation was unfavorable and increased expenses.
acquired in-process research and development during 2015 and 2014, the company incurred charges of $4 million and $15 million, respectively, for acquired in-process research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. these licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the company to make additional future payments of up to $12 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales. these future payments may be significant and occur over multiple years.
litigation provision the company recorded $4 million of litigation settlement provisions and related costs in 2015.
28
other expense the company recorded a $2 million charge in 2013 for an other-than-temporary impairment to an investment.
interest expense, net the increases in net interest expense in 2015 and 2014 were primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings.
provision for income taxes the four principal jurisdictions in which the company manufactures are the u.s., ireland, the united kingdom and singapore, where the marginal effective tax rates were approximately 37.5%, 12.5%, 20.25% and 0%, respectively, as of december 31, 2015. in 2015, the company entered into a new agreement with singapore tax authorities that extended a 0% contractual tax rate through march 2021. the contractual tax rate is dependent upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the company expects to meet. the current statutory tax rate in singapore is 17%. the companys effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; the outcome of various ongoing tax audit examinations; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. as a result of variability in these factors, the companys effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates for the current or prior years.
the companys effective tax rates were 13.4%, 12.0% and 8.2% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. in addition, the income tax provision for 2015 included a $3 million tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations.
the increase in the effective tax rate in 2014 as compared to 2013 can be attributed to the fact that the income tax provision for 2013 included a $31 million net tax benefit related to the completion of tax audit examinations. in addition, the r&d tax credit was retroactively extended in january 2013 for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. the entire $3 million benefit related to the 2012 tax year was recorded in the first quarter of 2013, and the 2013 benefit was included in the 2013 annual effective tax rate. the net income tax benefits related to the completed tax audit examinations and the 2012 r&d tax credit decreased the companys effective tax rate by 6.9 percentage points in 2013. the remaining differences between the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were primarily attributable to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates.

cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $560 million, $512 million and $485 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income:
   the changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. days sales outstanding was
71 days at december 31, 2015, 68 days at december 31, 2014 and 69 days at december 31, 2013.

   the changes in inventory were primarily attributable to anticipated annual increases in sales volumes, as well as new product launches.

   the changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of timing of payments to vendors. in addition, 2013 includes a $31 million decrease in accrued income taxes due to the resolution of ongoing tax audits.

   net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts.

            other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. in addition, the company made one-time contributions totaling $21 million to certain non-u.s. pension plans during 2014.

the interest rates applicable to the amended credit agreement are, at the companys option, equal to either the alternate base rate calculated daily (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 1/2% per annum, or (c) the adjusted libo rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in u.s. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted libo rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 basis points and 117.5 basis points for adjusted libo rate loans. the facility fee on the amended credit agreement ranges between 7.5 basis points and 20 basis points. the amended credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, the amended credit agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities.

31
be repaid within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2015, the company had a total amount available to borrow under the amended credit agreement of $428 million after outstanding letters of credit. as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, particularly in the u.s., along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions. in addition, there have been no recent significant changes to the companys financial position, nor are there any anticipated changes, to warrant a material adjustment related to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.

the interest rates applicable to the amended credit agreement are, at the companys option, equal to either the alternate base rate calculated daily (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 1/2% per annum, or (c) the adjusted libo rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in u.s. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted libo rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 basis points and 117.5 basis points for adjusted libo rate loans. the facility fee on the amended credit agreement ranges between 7.5 basis points and 20 basis points. the amended credit agreement requires that the company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. in addition, the amended credit agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all such covenants.

from time to time, the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. the company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the companys financial position or results of operations.
the company has long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company and whether the employee elects lump-sum or annuity payments. during fiscal year 2016, the company expects to contribute approximately $5 million to $10 million to the companys defined benefit plans.
the company has contingent consideration for an earnout pertaining to the medimass acquisition. the earnout payments are not included above since they are dependent upon many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of december 31, 2015 is $4 million.
the company licenses certain technology and software from third parties. future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of december 31, 2015 are immaterial. the company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the company could make additional future payments of up to $12 million, as well as royalties on future net sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. as a result, these potential payments are not included in the table above.
the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. if
33
all of the companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of december 31, 2015 were to become recognizable in the future, the company would record a total reduction of approximately $14 million in its income tax provision.
with limited exceptions, the company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before december 31, 2011. however, carryforward attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before january 1, 2012 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized. the company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company concluded tax audit disputes with tax authorities in the u.s. and japan that were related to matters for which the company had previously recorded uncertain tax benefits of approximately $35 million. the resolution of these tax disputes also entailed net global assessments against the company of approximately $4 million. accordingly, the company recorded a $35 million reduction in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and a $4 million increase in its current tax liabilities in the year ended december 31, 2013, which reduced the provision for income taxes and increased net income for the year ended december 31, 2013 by $31 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company concluded u.s. tax audit disputes that, in part, related to matters for which the company had recorded net uncertain tax benefits. the resolution of these tax disputes resulted in a $2 million reduction in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and a $2 million decrease in its provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, the company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $5 million within the next twelve months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. the company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
the company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company.
the company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. pursuant to these agreements, the company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the companys business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the company or its subcontractors. the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. historically, the companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial.
34
critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its policies and estimates. the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. there are other items within the companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. the companys deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to shipment of the instrument. at december 31, 2015, the company had current and long-term deferred revenue liabilities of $142 million and $29 million, respectively. revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order.
product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenue until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received, specifying fixed terms and prices. the company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. the company generally structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. in some cases, destination-based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site.
the companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is accounted for in accordance with multiple-element revenue recognition accounting standards. with respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the best estimate of selling price of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple-element arrangement when installation is complete. the company determines the best estimate of selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours.
instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period. the amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. no revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met.
sales of standalone software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. the companys software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
35
has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post-delivery obligations remaining. the revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. the company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered elements exists. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and recognized as revenue.
returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales. rights of return are not included in sales arrangements. revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. the company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit-worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro-economic environment. historically, the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. the companys accounts receivable balance at december 31, 2015 was $468 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $7 million.
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis (fifo). the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. the companys inventory balance at december 31, 2015 was recorded at its net realizable value of $263 million, which is net of write-downs of $17 million.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors the company considers important which could trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:
   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software and patent costs;

   significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and

   significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the companys capitalized patents, purchased technology, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses.

when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of
36
undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long-lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written-down to its estimated fair value. net intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $218 million, $333 million and $357 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january 1 of each year. for goodwill impairment review purposes, the company has two reporting units, waters division and ta division. the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following:
   significant decline in the companys projected revenue, earnings or cash flows;

   significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate;

   significant decline in the companys stock price or the stock price of comparable companies;

   adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and

   unanticipated competition.

income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. in the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations.
the accounting standards for income taxes require that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. in addition, the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. at december 31, 2015, the company had unrecognized tax benefits of $14 million.
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. at december 31, 2015, the companys warranty liability was $13 million.
37
litigation as described in item 3, legal proceedings, of part i of this form 10-k, the company is a party to various pending litigation matters. with respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. if and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable uncertainty.
pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. the company has assumed that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 6.35% for its u.s. benefit plans and 2.58% for its non-u.s. benefit plans.
at the end of each year, the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. the company utilized millimans bond matching model to determine the discount rate for its u.s. benefit plans. the company determined the discount rate for its non-u.s. benefit plans based on the analysis of the mercer pension discount curve for high quality investments as of december 31, 2015 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. at december 31, 2015, the company determined the weighted-average discount rate to be 4.59% for the u.s. benefit plans and 2.23% for the non-u.s. benefits plans.
a one-quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long-term rate of return would decrease the companys net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than $1 million. a one-quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the companys net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than $1 million.
stock-based compensation the accounting standards for stock-based compensation require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. the company has used the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. under the fair-value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be materially impacted. as stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. these accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of these accounting standards, the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period. the company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method.
38
as of december 31, 2015, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted-average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions):
unrecognized      weighted-average compensation         life in years costs stock options                        $51                   3.9
restricted stock units                40                   3.1
restricted stock                                            
total                                $91                   3.5
business combinations and asset acquisitions the company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. the results of each acquisition are included in the companys consolidated results as of the acquisition date and the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. any excess of the fair value consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred and acquired ipr&d is tested for impairment annually until completion of the acquired programs. upon commercialization, this indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, subject to periodic impairment reviews. if the research and development project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense. legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
the company also acquires intellectual property through licensing arrangements. these arrangements often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone or royalty payments, contingent upon certain future events. ipr&d acquired in an asset acquisition (as opposed to a business combination) is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use. subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether they have an alternative future use or should be expensed. payments made to third parties subsequent to commercialization are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.
contingent consideration in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to acquire medimass, the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on a royalty due on future sales of products containing the reims technology. in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations, the company determines the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including estimated future results and a discount rate reflective of the companys creditworthiness. a change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. although there is no contractual limit, total future undiscounted contingent consideration payments were estimated to be $4 million as of december 31, 2015, based on the companys best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products through 2034.
recent accounting standard changes and developments information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from part ii, item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this item 7. see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.
